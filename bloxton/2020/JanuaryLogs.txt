@High Rank Hey so I see Fraux has 8 votes for a demotion, seeing that his last session was in July, I can't help but agree. He does some applications once a month but still needs demoting. He says his computer is broken and he's trying to get it fixed which seems reasonable but that's been since April now. I personally think we should demote him to management and give him a little longer to get his computer fixed and start off as management again but I'll let you decide with a vote:

:aPES_Pizza: if you want Fraux to be demoted to Management.
ü§ï if you want Fraux to be demoted to Head.
:PES_HmmKnife: if you want Fraux to be demoted to LR.
:PES_AngeryFuckoff: if you want me to shut up and leave Fraux alone.

[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
You could argue that he should be demoted to LR since he has missed lots but idk I feel for him.


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 I talked to him recently and he still just doesn‚Äôt have a working computer


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525
He hasn‚Äôt really been on roblox at all


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
Hm.


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525
He said he wanted to still work once he got a new computer but idk when that‚Äôs happening


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont feel for him


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôll talk to him about it more


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hes been saying to fix his shit


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
since long time ago


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
his slot can be given to another more worthy


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
I mean


[01-Jan-20 10:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
doesnt take that long to fix one thing


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
It does for some people Mack


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
Computers are expensive


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
Really expensive


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
I could add an option for him to be fired or suspended and come back when he is good


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
Not everyone can just afford a new one


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but its been long time


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
But I think that is a 2017 thing?


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
he was active in 2017?


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
Let me talk to him to see if he thinks he will be able to come back soon


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
like that was when he was active last


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yes Cookie but I'm saying what we used to do


[01-Jan-20 10:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[01-Jan-20 10:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
Sure Emma


[01-Jan-20 10:51 AM] Cooqkie#2809
he can play on his phone?


[01-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs really hard


[01-Jan-20 10:51 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the last thing he did was a session


[01-Jan-20 10:51 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
on july 5


[01-Jan-20 10:52 AM] emma;#1525
I think he‚Äôd rather resign then be forced to host on his phone

i just archived leaks inactive thing


[01-Jan-20 10:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
because no one voted on it in 1 and a half months


[01-Jan-20 10:57 AM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[01-Jan-20 11:06 AM] bman#0435
leak only attends themed sessions just to build lol


[01-Jan-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
fraux needs to have the money to fix his computer atm. i believe he has it, but his computer store or apple store is not close to him


[01-Jan-20 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Or he is just lying at this point and just procrastinating because he probably has no motivation to do things at bloxton


[01-Jan-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey it was fine bc it wasn‚Äôt broken....


[01-Jan-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
He broke it in July


[01-Jan-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; that‚Äôs kinda a sick assumption to make about someone that‚Äôs been active and dedicated for a long time, especially bc I‚Äôve checked in with him about it


[01-Jan-20 12:43 PM] emma;#1525
How about everyone chills about fraux until I hear back from him, mkay?


[01-Jan-20 12:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fair enough.


[01-Jan-20 12:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not to mention, I did hear a heads up from him on the senior channel.


[01-Jan-20 01:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Speaking of which, anyone a little annoyed about Smile's inconsistent activity?


[01-Jan-20 01:02 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
smile only became active again right when we were about to demote him for inactivity


[01-Jan-20 01:02 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
then he went inactive again


[01-Jan-20 01:08 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
kqilerr is also really inactive but no one voted on his card lol


[01-Jan-20 01:10 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
kqilerr talks actively in the discord server almost every day tho :fluSHED:


[01-Jan-20 01:13 PM] bman#0435
i havent seen lucky since i was a manager lol


[01-Jan-20 01:20 PM] bman#0435
i just added a bunch of inactive staff btw


[01-Jan-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve seen lucky at the hotel here and there but not a lot


[01-Jan-20 01:32 PM] stacey#1000
Never at a session


[01-Jan-20 01:32 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs been a manager since like what V4?


[01-Jan-20 01:46 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; just because he is your friend doesn‚Äôt mean you know everything about him, tons of people make up lies because they have no motivation


[01-Jan-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
Maybe I know because he‚Äôs sent me photos...?


[01-Jan-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
Ethan you always think the worst of people


[01-Jan-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
And yeah fraux is my friend so I don‚Äôt appreciate you trash talking him either. If y‚Äôall want to fire him anyways I can‚Äôt stop you


[01-Jan-20 01:51 PM] ethan;#0003
How am I trash talking him?


[01-Jan-20 01:51 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I think we should wait to hear back from him, but he has been inactive for a while and if he doesn‚Äôt plan on getting it fixed soon then it might be best to demote him


[01-Jan-20 01:51 PM] ethan;#0003
You trash talk my friends all the time


[01-Jan-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
Calling him a liar?


[01-Jan-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
No I complain about Adam bc he‚Äôs literally racist and sexist


[01-Jan-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm just trying to get information from fraux before we make a choice.


[01-Jan-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs literally called being a good HR, not gonna apologize for it


[01-Jan-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Didn't he have some kind of dead pixel and it got worse? @emma;


[01-Jan-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Agreed with Emma. Best to give him a chance to explain over just making assumptions over the situation.


[01-Jan-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Either way, I don't think we need to axe him right away.


[01-Jan-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Never good to assume things about people or situations if you don‚Äôt know the full story.


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait Stacey, do you remember the Kelly situation?


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Erm, I think he still leaked content.


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] ethan;#0003
K6lly?


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause think about it.


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
What I think of the whole Kelly situation is she still did a wrong move. She won‚Äôt get her rank back.


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
She still said things she shouldn‚Äôt have.


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He told me the message with the paragraphs were meant for a GC for Harriet and Sunny.


[01-Jan-20 01:55 PM] ethan;#0003
Who‚Äôs Kelly


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Even if Harriet manipulated the situation.


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
She still did wrong things too.


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If this is true, he still leaked some content.


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Kelly old rank 8 @ethan;


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because that's not something that should be mentioned.


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly.


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] ethan;#0003
K6lly?


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep.


[01-Jan-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Kelly got fired for a reason.


[01-Jan-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
Won‚Äôt get their rank back.


[01-Jan-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
The evidence showed the wrong Kelly did.


[01-Jan-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
Idc if Harriet manipulated the situated. Kelly still chose to leak info and say things that should‚Äôve never been said.


[01-Jan-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
hi


[01-Jan-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Jan-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mainly ban her, I guess.


[01-Jan-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
Blacklist if not already


[01-Jan-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435

[01-Jan-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Anyone want to ban her from the Discord?


[01-Jan-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
If she still DMs people stuff we can‚Äôt control her DMs. If people still complain all we can do is tell them to block her


[01-Jan-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm not on pc


[01-Jan-20 02:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well, I can definitely do both.


[01-Jan-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
Is she in the discord?


[01-Jan-20 02:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep.


[01-Jan-20 03:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Now you see her true colours


[01-Jan-20 05:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@High Rank Looks like we have another accusation about NightsGems and nudes apparently. Apparently Tehana told Flurry and Claire that he was asking for nudes from Crystal and that she sent it to him. I'll be asking him questions regarding this accusation. The only catch is, Tehana reported him in the past, so I'll definitely have to handle the case with caution. In addition to that, I have received at least 2-3 screenshots in regards to investigating Crystal after interviewing Flurry, simply asking him if Crystal was inappropriate towards him.

[01-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000

And possibly June but I don‚Äôt see June too often


[01-Jan-20 05:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Personally, I'd go with June and Drew.


[01-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
June uses a tablet or iPad right


[01-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000

[01-Jan-20 05:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

especially for a mobile player, ik how hard it is to do all that stuff on mobile


[01-Jan-20 05:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Definitely solid, and she does really well at the hotel.


[01-Jan-20 05:55 PM] stacey#1000

It will be a hard decision


[01-Jan-20 05:56 PM] stacey#1000
Wait question


[01-Jan-20 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
Can people get demoted for online dating someone cause it is violating terms of service


[01-Jan-20 05:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It depends what it is, Stacey.


[01-Jan-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
tbh it is going to be hard since there really is only 5 managers that are currently deserving of it


[01-Jan-20 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
What managers


[01-Jan-20 05:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If it's somewhat innocent and doesn't really affect us, then let them be since it's not really our business.


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
Well like example


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
An MR online dating someone through roblox and discord


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
june, alex, drew, cookies, doqee


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
And then going on Vcs with people


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
However, if they're really sexual or acting flirtatious in many Bloxton games, they can be in serious trouble.


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
That makes sense


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
How about


[01-Jan-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
speaking if, hows the crystal investigation going


[01-Jan-20 05:59 PM] stacey#1000
Calling each other ‚Äúbabe‚Äù in a vc


[01-Jan-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435
om


[01-Jan-20 05:59 PM] stacey#1000
In a group chat


[01-Jan-20 05:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's tough, considering it may be private.


[01-Jan-20 06:00 PM] stacey#1000
Okay so basically I‚Äôll tell you something I found out recently but you can‚Äôt confront them about it and tell them I told you


[01-Jan-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think as long as it doesn't affect Bloxton and it's safe, the employees should be at least fine.


[01-Jan-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
How about if it‚Äôs an MR dating someone that‚Äôs an LR


[01-Jan-20 06:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If it's something compared to Crystal, they can be in serious trouble. For those of you who want to know the status, I managed to interview Flurry on Monday about her.


[01-Jan-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
I want to know


[01-Jan-20 06:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so.


[01-Jan-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Flurry did point out that she lied about her age multiple times to lure in more guys. It went from 14, 15, 16, & 17. We have no idea of what her real age is, but having to see that during the investigation is a big red flag.

Well in some cases some people shouldn‚Äôt even be telling people their age at all. But lying about is also bad. Like people lying about being 13+ to not get banned in the discord server.


[01-Jan-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
Concerning she lies all the time about it


[01-Jan-20 06:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also, there's something else interesting.


[01-Jan-20 06:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Flurry apparently roleplayed with Crystal as a joke and it progressed to this:

[01-Jan-20 06:11 PM] stacey#1000
Smh


[01-Jan-20 06:11 PM] stacey#1000
Concerning flurry roleplays too though....encouraging her and acting inappropriate as well.


[01-Jan-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
He may be reporting it, but still.


[01-Jan-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
He legit encouraged her.


[01-Jan-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True, but he did eventually told him that he wasn't very comfortable.


[01-Jan-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
her*


[01-Jan-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
He still shouldn‚Äôt have encouraged her.


[01-Jan-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs part of the blame for it.


[01-Jan-20 06:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe they've dated around that time?


[01-Jan-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
Possibly.


[01-Jan-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
All I know is, it's not looking too good for Crystal, may as well be the first firing for an MR in 2020.


[01-Jan-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
Agreed. But I‚Äôm also concerned about flurry.


[01-Jan-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
Clearly he did some wrong stuff too, even if he reported it.


[01-Jan-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn‚Äôt say a firing for him.


[01-Jan-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe a suspension at the least.


[01-Jan-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
In the evidence I am concerned how inappropriate he is being and how he encourages her. Who knows what else he has said or if he has acted this way with others.


[01-Jan-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, it looked like Crystal started it first here.


[01-Jan-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm.


[01-Jan-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn‚Äôt matter who started it, flurry still clearly went along with it and encouraged her more.


[01-Jan-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
If he was truly uncomfortable with it, why not tell her that from the start instead of going along with it and encouraging her?


[01-Jan-20 06:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
Maybe it was Crystal encouraging him instead?


[01-Jan-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Possibly.


[01-Jan-20 06:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn, did you see what I posted for the Investigation Board? @xM_inn


[01-Jan-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
Look in the evidence though. To me, they both were inappropriate. Doesn‚Äôt matter who started it. They both were clearly acting inappropriate and both encouraging each other.


[01-Jan-20 06:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
no


[01-Jan-20 06:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so let me summarize.


[01-Jan-20 06:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's keep in mind that the Flurry evidence is exactly a year old


[01-Jan-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I had an interview with Flurry and asked if he had any inappropriate experiences with Crystal.

[01-Jan-20 06:23 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
led her on


[01-Jan-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We've received some word from Minn about Crystal sending pornography content to Punch on Snapchat. When questioned about it, Crystal apologized and knows that she may being getting the boot. There's a catch though, as she pointed out the Punch manipulated her into sending these. Apparently, he threatened Crystal and supposedly sent CBs after her if she didn't agree to send the videos.


[01-Jan-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Punch mentioned some names of guys she hooked up with, and one of them was Flurry.


[01-Jan-20 06:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Trey I‚Äôm not that far behind


[01-Jan-20 06:26 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[01-Jan-20 06:26 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Did punch do that-


[01-Jan-20 06:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I doubt it, but we'll see.


[01-Jan-20 06:26 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Did he threaten her ?


[01-Jan-20 06:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he denied doing so, if I'm not mistaken.


[01-Jan-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
how did they hook up tf


[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435
how do u hook up over snap


[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
U can‚Äôt hook up over a game BAHAH


[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If I recall correctly, @xM_inn originally messaged Punch first.


[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435

[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think they started hooking up on Discord, then it progressed to them giving each other their Snapchat.


[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
not the other way round lmao


[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435

[01-Jan-20 06:27 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

I think they might've been good friends on general discussion.


[01-Jan-20 06:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe they've been in a group chat at one point.

@High Rank TBT to last senior vote when we all AGREED to make a new rule that when you put up a nomination, you MUST include when they were promoted to manager. Can y'all please not forget that... and if you put up a card already add when they were promoted?

So funny how she tries to blame Bloxton for her own childish and idiotic choices.


[02-Jan-20 01:47 AM] stacey#1000

[02-Jan-20 12:37 PM] xM_inn#2821

i had a good idea it was loui, but keep in mind i only had evidence in **may** which was before loui got blacklisted


[02-Jan-20 12:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
shouldn't loui be punished for assisting a CB in obtaining an MR position though?


[02-Jan-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[02-Jan-20 12:46 PM] xM_inn#2821

yall she has the shortest MR career ever üòÇ


[02-Jan-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs not the first


[02-Jan-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
Wasn‚Äôt simpleaesthetics or something got demoted too not long after getting promoted to rank 10.


[02-Jan-20 01:01 PM] katie#0200
yeah she was rank 10 for like 30 mins


[02-Jan-20 01:01 PM] katie#0200
bubble was for literally 15 mins


[02-Jan-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525

[02-Jan-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs scary


[02-Jan-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
Why do people only report it when they get MR and not as soon as they find out no matter what rank they are :facepalm_blob:


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think she didn't know unless someone told her


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Either way


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's gone gone


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] katie#0200
jenna deleted the message where she said someone else gave them the report because she was too scared to come to an hr


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] katie#0200
and im pretty sure i know which mr knew all along


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] katie#0200
no


[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
In all seriousness, who?


[02-Jan-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Well, Katie if you want you can promote Jax since rip bubble


[02-Jan-20 01:06 PM] katie#0200
i believe it was adrizys, she's friends with loui and amara. i was in a call with loui a few weeks ago and he said that she wasn't friends with amara anymore or something, but it would make a whole lot of sense. i had to talk to adri about being scared to talk to me because loui keeps telling me about the fact that she tells him stuff like 'omg katie hates me' 'im so scared of katie' and stuff like that


[02-Jan-20 01:07 PM] katie#0200
nah it's okay i barely ever see jax unless i stay up till 3 am


[02-Jan-20 01:08 PM] stacey#1000
Alright


[02-Jan-20 01:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she may have decided to tell someone else


[02-Jan-20 01:10 PM] katie#0200
yeah she did


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] katie#0200
then that person reported it to me


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] katie#0200
but likeeee


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] katie#0200
she needs to learn to report herself.. especially if she knows if a CB has a staff account


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[02-Jan-20 01:18 PM] katie#0200

how to have an easy shift

step 1) join empty server
step 2) wait for all the staff to join u and ask h about promotions

[LEAKING]

Leaking is big deal when it comes to this group and its chats. We taking leaking VERY seriously. Leaking is a major major offense that will lead to an instant termination of your rank.

Some things that may be considered leaking are:

-Telling your friends/people about the MR channels.
-Taking screenshots of the content in the MR channels and sending it to your friends/people.
-Telling your friends/people through a voice call.

If you end up leaking on accident, delete the stuff right away and message an HR. Consequences will not be as major.

If you don‚Äôt leak, you will be happily thriving in your new MR rank.

Any questions about leaking?

[02-Jan-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
I Leaking:

Leaking is a big no no when it comes to the MR channels in the discord. If you are caught leaking any MR+ content you will immediately be terminated.

Leaking could be as followed:

-Telling your friends about the channel
-Taking screenshots of things that happened in the channels and sending it to LRs or guests
-Telling LRs or guests on a voice call

If you do end up leaking on accident, it is best to tell an HR right away as the consequences may not be as major.

If you don't leak, you'll be all set in that category, pretty easy to follow.

@xM_inn can champion (former hr) get his former hr role


[02-Jan-20 06:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why is he even here?


[02-Jan-20 06:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Isn't he supposed to be banned?


[02-Jan-20 06:48 PM] bman#0435
whatd he do


[02-Jan-20 06:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Basically, he was talking a lot of shit in Asen's server about BH. Not to mention, at the time, he was basically Kayla's partner in-crime.


[02-Jan-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
well that was a year ago-


[02-Jan-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he was banned from what I recall because of that, I'm not sure if he's supposed to be here.


[02-Jan-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
should i see hr team opinion


[02-Jan-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Definitely should consider that, I kind of disagree unless he sends us an apology.


[02-Jan-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Him being involved was seriously not cool at all.


[02-Jan-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
@High Rank Champion004, former HR, has rejoined the Bloxton chat and requested for the talkative and former HR roles.. Apparently, he trashed-talked BH in Asen's server, and was banned, but later unbanned. Please react below with what you think we should do.

:blob: Ban again
:blobbongos: Decline his ticket request but keep him in the server.
:6876_Rainbow_Blob_Trash: Give talkative role, but not former HR role
:fastblob: Give both the talkative and former HR role

if only u were


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
what did he trash talk about exactly


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
btw, that stuff happened a year ago


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
if it was that long ago maybe give him a chance


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
idek who he is so


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
From what I remember, they threw shade at some of the members.


[02-Jan-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I had someone basically spy on them on what they were doing.


[02-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And knowing how he didn't really apologize to this day isn't too good.


[02-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
You sure it was Champ? @xAfroTrey


[02-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep.

[02-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
I've just looked back to December 2018 and January 2019 in the HR chat for his name and I don't see anything. @xAfroTrey


[02-Jan-20 06:57 PM] bman#0435
theres no evidence on card tho


[02-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
Got any proof, Trey?


[02-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Champ, Kayla, Asen, Marti, Cosmic, etc.


[02-Jan-20 06:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm trying to find it.


[02-Jan-20 06:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
Okay.


[02-Jan-20 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
ill wait for evidence as well before I decide anything cause idk who he is


[02-Jan-20 07:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oof champ


[02-Jan-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oof, Discord was unable to load it.


[02-Jan-20 07:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought champ did something to get himself banned but I forgot what


[02-Jan-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I guess we don't have a choice, but I'm very hesitant over him getting the role due to my experience.


[02-Jan-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh well.

[03-Jan-20 12:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Um, it seems like they're bickering over nothing- @bman


[03-Jan-20 12:48 PM] bman#0435
exactly, shes beinf disrespectful to them for no reason lol


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
and uses being an mr as an excuse


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
With all due respect, I'm definitely confronting her.


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
‚Äúu do realize i have perms to warn‚Äù


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's a lie.


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
‚Äúim an mr‚Äù


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
lol


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
u can confront her


[03-Jan-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
gtg now


[03-Jan-20 01:17 PM] stacey#1000
If anything, she is the one getting warned in that whole situation. Plus, she can‚Äôt warn people. This really looks like she will never become a manager anytime soon with that behaviour.


[03-Jan-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Agreed.


[03-Jan-20 01:17 PM] stacey#1000
Are you warning her?


[03-Jan-20 01:18 PM] stacey#1000
She definitely needs an official warning.


[03-Jan-20 01:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm talking to her about it.


[03-Jan-20 01:18 PM] stacey#1000
What is her excuse for being disrespectful?


[03-Jan-20 01:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not sure.


[03-Jan-20 01:19 PM] stacey#1000
She doesn‚Äôt seem to understand that LRs look up to MRs and that just because she is an MR doesn‚Äôt give  her the right to disrespect people and fool around.


[03-Jan-20 01:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so the user was being disrespectful first. @stacey

**SHIFT PICTURES** _reannounced_ 

Greetings MR team! HRs have noticed many of you have been initiating shift photos. Now, there is nothing wrong with doing shift photos, but it depends on the amount of people you include.

Please make sure you only allow 2-3 staff in the photo, not the whole server. We should not be seeing all staff within the server within a group photo. Whether it is in the back room, at the pool, or even in the lobby, it is not acceptable.

This leaves every station empty leaving the guests with no staff to turn to. If you take a shift photo with all staff, do not be surprised with a warning being directed towards you. 

Again, you should only take a picture with 2-4 staff members, but please make sure you are leaving some of every rank still working. Do not take all staff off duty just for a photo. This goes to every rank.

DM an HR if you have any questions!

Her account turns out to be <13 anyway- still she let Loui on her account apparently


[03-Jan-20 04:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Everything is perfect as far as I know.

So, let me get this straight.


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She had safechat and still account shared?


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
I always find out if they have safechsf before promoting


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs at trainings


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] katie#0200
Well min received a video from Loui on the bubble account in May


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
I name all c7rn to check


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
Or if it‚Äôs at the hotel


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know about you guys, but she still deserved to be fired.


[03-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
And I don‚Äôt want to make it obvious


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] katie#0200
Yeah me too but i don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a CB anymore


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
TREY


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
SHE WAS LITERALLLY A CB


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] katie#0200
No bman


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
I go on an alt account and act like I know nothing and ask how do I know if I have safechst to the person I wanna promote and see them say c7rn


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] katie#0200
I don‚Äôt think amara even was on that account to be honest


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah idk


[03-Jan-20 04:52 PM] katie#0200

[03-Jan-20 04:53 PM] katie#0200
Apparently, from the person who sent proof


[03-Jan-20 04:53 PM] katie#0200
Who happens to be amara


[03-Jan-20 04:53 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] katie#0200
Amara sent her the proof


[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] katie#0200
Then she sent it to me


[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] katie#0200
And I fired from there


[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] bman#0435
ask bubble to send her dms with jenna then


[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] katie#0200
But they just admitted to photoshopping it


[03-Jan-20 04:54 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[03-Jan-20 04:55 PM] bman#0435
question amara then question loui then question bubble


[03-Jan-20 04:55 PM] katie#0200
Mhm Loui DMed me this morning saying it‚Äôs not him


[03-Jan-20 04:56 PM] katie#0200
Apparently Loui is bubbles irl cousin


[03-Jan-20 04:56 PM] katie#0200
Bubble says it isn‚Äôt Loui and she doesn‚Äôt know who amara is


[03-Jan-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Somebody's lying.


[03-Jan-20 04:57 PM] bman#0435
wtf are the odds of that


[03-Jan-20 04:57 PM] bman#0435
lmao


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] katie#0200
Likee what should I do about this now, I announced that she was a CB aka amara was owning that account but I kinda doubt that now


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
lol I still have a suspicion that Loui is bubble ngl even tho the proof is supposedly photoshopped


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] katie#0200
Mhm


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] katie#0200
I can‚Äôt really prove it apart from the video min has


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
bc Loui even pointed out that bubble was rank 1 in general


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
loui was the first to point it out


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
üëÄ


[03-Jan-20 04:58 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
and it's very unlikely they're cousins.. it's a possibility but yknow..


[03-Jan-20 04:59 PM] katie#0200
Yeah


[03-Jan-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly I think they are doing it to try to get her rank back now thinking Jenna wasn‚Äôt going to report it


[03-Jan-20 04:59 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
:thinkception:

Cinder usually does a couple of things


[03-Jan-20 06:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) Argue


[03-Jan-20 06:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

tries to find loopholes in an investigation to protect himself


[03-Jan-20 06:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Basically he found Ava in the comments section and contacted her


[03-Jan-20 06:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
hes not safe to be around so lets just stay far away


[03-Jan-20 06:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He went from apologizing to her to trying to expose Meme


[03-Jan-20 06:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
but that was lowkey funny üòÇ

[03-Jan-20 06:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I basically sent him the letter and told him why he was demoted


[03-Jan-20 06:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
he tried to find loopholes in his firing


[03-Jan-20 06:13 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

Omg @xM_inn this whole fizze pinging thing is just way too funny now - they made an announcement about how people find all the pings annoying so they‚Äôd move important stuff to Twitter, then they deleted the announcement and pinged about something else again


[03-Jan-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they keep hyping up fizze for the longest time now

they called out frappe for not releasing v5 and they can't even release their v2 cafe either

"Our cafe is going to be the next new generation of cafes on the Roblox industry."

yeah right


[03-Jan-20 06:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Baby's smart, he wouldn't even give a release date until he knows for certain


[03-Jan-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
our cafe is gonna turn the tables of the roblox industry


[03-Jan-20 06:40 PM] katie#0200

[03-Jan-20 06:50 PM] stacey#1000
here is an example


[03-Jan-20 06:50 PM] stacey#1000
no one says hi to hadley


[03-Jan-20 06:51 PM] stacey#1000
when she says it multiple times


[03-Jan-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jan-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jan-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
not being rude


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
this happens to a lot of mRs


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
and thats why we get complaints


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
of people feeling left out


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
and not included


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
and resigning over it


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes sstacey


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] katie#0200

[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's kind of dumb


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ngl


[03-Jan-20 06:52 PM] katie#0200
A lot of mrs complain about it


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
only catch is


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
ill make an annoincement cause thats all we can do


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
realistically, not everyone is gonna be ur friend


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] katie#0200
True but seven times-


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] katie#0200
It‚Äôs not like they aren‚Äôt friends


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] katie#0200
We can‚Äôt force people but it is kinda rude idk


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
still


[03-Jan-20 06:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think they got caught up in addie's conversation


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
they should at least say hi


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
this happens all the time


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
ok making announcement


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
thing is tho


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can't punish them soo


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk


[03-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is coming from a person who doesn't really experience this problem so what do i know lol


[03-Jan-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
seven times is a bit much ngl


[03-Jan-20 06:55 PM] katie#0200
true but it‚Äôs not a good feeling when ur constantly being ignored - I think we should just remind the MRs to be inclusive and say hi


[03-Jan-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
yall rly did live my life back when i was an mr


[03-Jan-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
instead of a "hi" id get "wrong time bman"


[03-Jan-20 06:56 PM] katie#0200
Wh-


[03-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think he means that he says "hi"


[03-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but something negative happens


[03-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it could be:


[03-Jan-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
id say hi and theyd just respond to me negatively or not at all


[03-Jan-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
lol


[03-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) leaking


[03-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
B) some bullshit arguement


[03-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
C) other


[03-Jan-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000

Greetings, MR team.

I am making this announcement to inform you all, yet again that you should be including everyone in staff lounge. We are all a team here and staff lounge is for all of you to communicate with each other and have fun. If someone says hi, please say hi back as it is the respectful thing to do. It is quite disrespectful to not include someone or not say a simple hello. 
You don‚Äôt have to be friends with everyone, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt say a simple hello to someone. We don‚Äôt want anyone feeling left out, we are a team here. Please remember to be kind to each other, and include each other in conversations. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact any member of the HR team.

replace it with this one: "Don't get us wrong, we do get that you guys are mainly socializing on different conversations. However, the lack of them being included and no response after them saying "hi" in the staff lounge is definitely concerning. Considering that we did point this out in the recent press conference."


[03-Jan-20 07:11 PM] stacey#1000
Ok

I think that should be cut out


[03-Jan-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Something about it seems passive aggressive


[03-Jan-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's hard to explain


[03-Jan-20 07:15 PM] bman#0435

Ok announcing now


[03-Jan-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what on your thoughts on a possible blacklist with crystal regarding what we invesigated


[03-Jan-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause we've known a couple of things:


[03-Jan-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) she is quite inconsistent with her age


[03-Jan-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) she was quite sexual with multiple users


[03-Jan-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3) the moaning audio, uh-


[03-Jan-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
4) she did admit to doing these soooo


[03-Jan-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the only reason i can think of not blacklisting her is her admitting that she was inappropriate


[03-Jan-20 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
I say blacklist yeah


[03-Jan-20 07:22 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I'd blacklist


[03-Jan-20 07:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
can she still be in the discord though ü§î


[03-Jan-20 07:23 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
bruh low-key she's going after a lot of guys


[03-Jan-20 07:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's what i'm debating too


[03-Jan-20 07:23 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I'd rather her not be able to do that


[03-Jan-20 07:23 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
just going into our staff's dms and doing that..


[03-Jan-20 07:23 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

ok


[03-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey are you firing crystal?


[03-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
Make sure whoever does doesn‚Äôt give the reason for her termination due to it involving child pornography, even though she‚Äôs *technically* not a child


[03-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
or if they want to say the reason they can‚Äôt attach her name to it


[03-Jan-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was about to step in and do that but minn told me to wait for you @emma;


[03-Jan-20 07:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i did list things on what we did know about the case


[03-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) age consistency (multiple people have witnessed this)


[03-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) audio and video (i regret having to sit down with both of them)


[03-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3) apparently nights and her having some sort of thing??


[03-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the only catch is


[03-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the accusation is from tehana


[03-Jan-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was thinking that we could ask crystal about it and maybe have some info about him


[03-Jan-20 07:57 PM] emma;#1525
What accusation from tehana..?


[03-Jan-20 07:57 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey


[03-Jan-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so i posted it here


[03-Jan-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
its also on the investigation board if you want to look at it


[03-Jan-20 07:58 PM] emma;#1525
On mobile


[03-Jan-20 07:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ohh


[03-Jan-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[03-Jan-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Apparently there's an accusation about Nights possibly asking Crystal for nudes

[04-Jan-20 04:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
new way of tracking activity pls


[04-Jan-20 04:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so robux =/= amount of sessions


[04-Jan-20 04:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
maybe put like half is from checklists or smth


[04-Jan-20 04:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then like bonus for more admin acts


[04-Jan-20 04:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
üòî


[04-Jan-20 04:18 AM] stacey#1000
Can we change our checklist too


[04-Jan-20 04:18 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn is hr checklist up to be changed a bit too or just seniors


[04-Jan-20 04:19 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause i love admin acts and maybe my life here will be just clearing it


[04-Jan-20 04:19 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
üò©


[04-Jan-20 04:19 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
maybe for those who are in the investigation team stuff


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
one of the shifts can be changed into investigations


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ahahhaha


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah because some of us like have things we do more. Like Mack said he does bans while I usually don‚Äôt. I usually host more but then after I host I don‚Äôt feel like banning people at the hotel


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye i dont like sessions cause im a bad planner for them


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i always do it last minute and thats why i probably have max 2 servers


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but admin acts is quick and


[04-Jan-20 04:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
can do at any time


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] stacey#1000
I host a lot more than I do anything else. So like if can have shifts taken out and more sessions added that would be great


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] stacey#1000
Tickets is fine cause they are easy


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] stacey#1000
And fast


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
shifts is just burdening


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[04-Jan-20 04:21 AM] stacey#1000
Admin acts is not quick all the time when there is  a lot  to clear


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] stacey#1000
You can legit be there for 2 hours


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
its quick if 10 is the minimum üòé


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye i take like 40 mins to clear 160 bans


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
its cancer when the managers just whack duplicates


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or spell names wrong


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] stacey#1000
I would be so happy to have shifts taken out all together. Or at least have it changed to just 1 shift because 1 shift is 30 mins


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then the same person appears later on


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
makes me go off tempo cause i count every ban i do


[04-Jan-20 04:22 AM] stacey#1000
Every time I do a shift. I get crowded and annoyed from banning Cbs a million times so it‚Äôs not fun


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] stacey#1000
Managers never look for duplicates


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so i think checklist shud be played into specialisations


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
like preferences or smth


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] stacey#1000
Put more admin acts on Mack‚Äôs


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] stacey#1000
More sessions on mine with less shifts


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so those who like sessions more increase more sessions


[04-Jan-20 04:23 AM] stacey#1000
Or no shifts


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then like 50 admin acts for those who like


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or smth


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] stacey#1000
Not everyone hosts so


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] stacey#1000
I do


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
although i prefer 100 admin acts as a checklist


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] stacey#1000
Or 100


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause 10 admin acts is kinda


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
less


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] stacey#1000
For a week 100 is a lot


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] stacey#1000
Mack do you do tickets too


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
yes


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i do tickets and admin acts mainly


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] stacey#1000
No


[04-Jan-20 04:24 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
~300 Admin acts | 13 warnings, 4 suspensions, ~256 bans, 3 fires, 28 hinting reports. | 9:31 PM - 11:32 PM SGT | 17/11/2019.


[04-Jan-20 04:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[04-Jan-20 04:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
its not really about warnings, its about him proving himself trustworthy and responsible


[04-Jan-20 04:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
ofc that doesnt mean hes allowed warnings


[04-Jan-20 04:29 AM] xM_inn#2821

[04-Jan-20 04:30 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
You are only allowed to obtain the Talkative Role for now. To obtain the Former HR role, you need to have a clear record for the next month, which means 0-1 warnings in the server. After that, feel free to create another ticket to ask for the Former HR Role. This ticket will remain open until you've replied.


[04-Jan-20 04:30 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

I'm giving Champ the former HR role, he's promised me he won't leak or trash-talk or stuff, and people do change over time. There's been no trouble from him for at least a year now and I believe he'll stand loyal. One bad move from him though & his role needs to be removed. Keep your eyes on him.


[04-Jan-20 05:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok


[04-Jan-20 05:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

Double ping, sorry. Since it's a new year I've been thinking about some things. Would you all like new activity cards for 2020, or would you like to keep the ones from last year? Would you like another way of tracking activity instead of checklists? Let me know of some ideas and your opinions in #senior-lounge. We don't have to change anything, but I thought I'd ask ya'll about it.


[04-Jan-20 08:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
if seniors change we change


[04-Jan-20 08:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

Hey y'all, please be sure to rank your passers. I'm noticing that a lot of them up on the Senior Management Board from yesterday. I don't want the board to be clogged up and look somewhat disorganized. If you need me to rank, I'll do them in 2 hours since I'm going to be away from my hotel room. Thanks! @stacey @ethan; @bman

You shouldn't wait 24 hours unless ABSOLUTELY necessary


[04-Jan-20 11:45 AM] emma;#1525
Like if you guys don't have anything to do right after your sessions, you need to rank


[04-Jan-20 11:45 AM] emma;#1525

[04-Jan-20 11:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

Bman, can you stop acting out like this so many times? No offense, but it's getting out of control.


[04-Jan-20 11:55 AM] emma;#1525
Bman, you need to learn how to behave properly. This is outrageous behavior! Dear lord!


[04-Jan-20 11:55 AM] bman#0435

Honestly Nia might need a suspension for being disrespectful to people or a heavy written warning


[04-Jan-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
Nia might be fired if she‚Äôs leaking


[04-Jan-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôve gotten 2 reports on her being rude lately too


[04-Jan-20 12:17 PM] bman#0435
when did she leak


[04-Jan-20 12:18 PM] stacey#1000
If she didn‚Äôt leak she really does need a suspension


[04-Jan-20 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; you got a host for your second server yet?


[04-Jan-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525

[04-Jan-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Jan-20 12:24 PM] emma;#1525
Okay then i'll have to beg someone to host the big server... i don't really like leaving them unhosted, especially with MRs lol


[04-Jan-20 12:26 PM] emma;#1525

[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
more*


[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
@bman before saying "i never see him" pls look him up on trello and the discord server so you can accurately asses his actual activity


[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
bc if someone isn't your timezone that means you won't see them, but doesn't mean they aren't active lol


[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
i said **i** dont see him


[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
not that others dont


[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
look at reports


[04-Jan-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
that's not a reason not to vote though


[04-Jan-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
because you can look up how active someone really is


[04-Jan-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
and make an opinion based on that


[04-Jan-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
instead of how often you run into someone amongst the 300 servers we have across 4 games lmao


[04-Jan-20 01:01 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank Got proof of Nia leaking to Ava, that combined with the 5 or so reports on her being rude is of course more than enough to fire her. Minn has approved. If anyone wants to fire her, please claim it now or I'll do it. Must be within the next 10 minutes please.

[04-Jan-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
we'll see what she says


[04-Jan-20 05:19 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Dear Dr_Niaa,

It has come to the HR teams' attention that you have indefinitely been leaking sensitive MR information to individuals who are not on the MR team. We've discussed this with the MR team many times, and leaking of any form results in a termination of your position Therefore, as of today, you will be removed from your current position of Head of Security, and ranked down to Hotel Guest. We wish you luck within your future.

[04-Jan-20 09:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"If you're really sorry, apologize to Ava. The treatment you gave to her for the leaking was uncalled for and unjustified."

@High Rank Hello, I've just received a report on miaciaus, ex-Head. She was leaking information that is told when an LR gets promoted to a Head to these users: xvciv and DeaddCorpsee. The evidence provided by Deadd himself, will be attached below. Although miaciaus is not part of the MR Team anymore, I still feel that leaking these information to others, especially DeaddCorpsee, a Security, is unacceptable. I believe this can be a blacklist. Please state your opinions below.
Blacklist: üôÑ 
Blacklist + Removal of MR Role on Discord: üòî 
Blacklist + Ban : üòé 
Nothing: üò≠                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Blacklist + Ban + Removal of MR Role: üò¨

It‚Äôs fine you get pinged all the time when you are offline lmao


[05-Jan-20 08:38 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
@High Rank Hello, again. This is second ping omg. So I've seen Dr_Niaa's resignation letter, and it is kind of inappropriate behaviour to share your termination proof to the entire community on your "resignation letter", when it's clearly a termination lol. Also, although, she thanked a whole bunch of people, she included a tea video from 2 years ago, and still wants us to forgive her, which is already weird in my opinion. Her Discord custom status states that "im so sorry bh, pls forgive me and dont hate me". She wants forgiveness while posting a tea video, revealing her termination proof, which is the shaded version that we did, and kind of like acting like every Former MR is. Thus, I want to forward that she should most likely not obtain the Talkative role or just be blacklisted, depending on how you guys state your opinions. Thanks for reading.

mhm


[05-Jan-20 08:40 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol i just wrote that in a rush so psps


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
Possible blacklist for her behaviour. Like I said before even when she was an MR I wanted her fired for her behaviour alone


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i'll just sneakily change that former mr role to talkative

ye


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and she wants to be forgiven!!


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but spilling tea in her tea doc


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
So I think blacklist


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and she sent the trey shaded proof


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
instead of her dms with ava


[05-Jan-20 08:41 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but shes like im sorry ava


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah she is still disrespectful


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
she basically leaked info too


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
to the entire general discussion


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause she basically just told everyone bubble is a cb from her letter


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
She got fired for leaking


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
To Ava


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[05-Jan-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
So yes she leaked


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
she included it in t he letter


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and sent it to general


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
And now that she got fired. She is acting immature over it


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
Omg


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or somehow


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
Blacklist and ban from everything


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
Even discord I say


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the entire general discussion knows everything


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause the mrs are saying that


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
I-


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
Kick her from the server


[05-Jan-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
If she is leaking to general


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
Oml


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or probably just


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
Or just ban right off the bat


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
bubble telling people


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause she just left the server after being fired


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then she joined back but still needs talkative


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
thats just an assumption but its most likely bubble telling


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
I saw she requested talkative role


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then the entire gd knows


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
But didn‚Äôt give it to her


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
mhm


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
So if Nia has no talkative role


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
yo im just saying people were talking about bubble being a cb and being terminated
and i was legit like
how does gd know this...?


[05-Jan-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
And is not the one who sent it

[05-Jan-20 08:45 AM] Cooqkie#2809
What happened?


[05-Jan-20 08:45 AM] stacey#1000
I still say Nia gets a blacklist


[05-Jan-20 08:45 AM] stacey#1000
2 formers


[05-Jan-20 08:45 AM] stacey#1000
Are leaking


[05-Jan-20 08:45 AM] stacey#1000
Miaclause and Dr_Nia


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] stacey#1000
And Nia is acting immature and unprofessional now


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] stacey#1000
If she tells people she was fired that‚Äôs fine


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] stacey#1000
Her choice on that


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] stacey#1000
Like just saying she was fired.


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
What does everyone know now tho


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
In general chat


[05-Jan-20 08:46 AM] stacey#1000
They all know


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] stacey#1000
Bubble was a cb


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Th at she was fired?


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] stacey#1000
And was fired for it


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
nia told them that?


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] stacey#1000
Read her resignation letter


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
K


[05-Jan-20 08:47 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so 1st situation about miaciaus: she was having a gamenight with 2 people, DeaddCorpsee, a current security and xvciv, who is irrelevant in this, but still someone who knows what happened. miaciaus just basically told them the entire promotion guide katie sent her to them.


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
although shes former, but leaking such information is really not proper behaviour of a former?


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
like none of the formers really leaked what happen during promotions


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but she just pasted word for word from what katie told her on discord while she was promoted to head


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] stacey#1000
She put in her resignation letter bubble was fired


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] stacey#1000
So she leaked all over again


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye mayb she has another server


[05-Jan-20 08:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or smth


[05-Jan-20 08:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause the mrs have her letter


[05-Jan-20 08:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but not gd


[05-Jan-20 08:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or maybe just dm


[05-Jan-20 08:49 AM] stacey#1000
Yep I vote blacklist and ban for both of them


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] stacey#1000
Like....legit Nia gets fired for leaking and goes being an idiot leaking the thing she was fired for to everyone


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
2nd situation: dr_niaa created a resignation letter but she wrote how bubble was a cb in it and also showed termination proof, which was shaded by trey, instead of her dms with ava, she also put a tea video from 2 years ago, concerning olivia(croustillant), while wanting forgiveness in her custom status. this makes her look very immature and just plain dumb imo.


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i believe if she got talkative, she just gonna put that doc in gd


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then boom


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but now she isnt in gd and only mrs have her letter


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I skipped her ticket


[05-Jan-20 08:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but shes being immature in the letter still so eh


[05-Jan-20 08:51 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
if it gets out to gd


[05-Jan-20 08:51 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the consequences will be worse


[05-Jan-20 08:51 AM] stacey#1000
I was like hell no you ain‚Äôt getting talkative rn


[05-Jan-20 08:51 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[05-Jan-20 09:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
@High Rank Hello, sorry for the third ping, but this is the conclusion for the previous 2 pings that I did. I will provide a summary of both situations so that it can be quicker, you can also look at the proof for each situation below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Situation 1: miaciaus. miaciaus, an ex-Head of Services, was found to be leaking an entire head promotion guide in a VIP server of Tower of Hell, to 2 other people, namely, DeaddCorpsee, a Security, and xvciv, who isn't part of Bloxton at all, but still knows about the promotion guide. Mia was copying word for word the promotion guide and this is unacceptable behaviour as it is still considered leaking MR information, which I believe, not many or no Former MRs have done before. I believe this can be a blacklist. If you have any other punishments to give, please provide a reason why.

Situation 2: Dr_Niaa, a Former MR, was found to be leaking her termination proof in her resignation letter. This is the shaded version, which means the red pen colouring. She also included a tea video on us, from 2 years ago, which concerns olivia(Croustillant), I believe. However, she wants us to forgive her, as stated on her custom status: ‚Äúim so sorry bh, pls forgive me and dont hate me‚Äù. This to me, is kind of absurd, as she wants to be forgiven, while spilling cold tea and her termination proof in her resignation letter. MRs have already received the letter and posted in Staff Lounge. She also stated how bubble was a CB, that‚Äôs why she was fired. Currently, she has a ticket to obtain a Talkative Role, but the consequences will be dire if her resignation letter gets into the general discussion as the entire community will then know about the termination proof and the truth for bubble. This is immature to me, and, she shared her shaded proof, sent by an HR, but not her DMs with Ava, while apologising to Ava. I also believe this can be a blacklist. She sent her letter to Ava's Discord Server, Hadley's Discord Server and Kenzi's Discord Server. If you have any other punishments, please provide a reason why.

[05-Jan-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525

[05-Jan-20 10:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
We played Stapleton until 2


[05-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
that's still over 8 hours of sleep üòÇ


[05-Jan-20 10:50 AM] katie#0200
great there's 5 servers


[05-Jan-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
protip: dont plan morning sessions if ur up until TWO IN THE MORNING


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
we have hosts for 4 if trey still hosts


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Whatever


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
and katie if you get like 2-3 managers on the fifth, you can host two at once


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
I did it once


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] katie#0200
what really lmao


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
I twasn't hard bc I had older managers on the other one


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525

[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
bc no seniors offered tohost


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] katie#0200
hhow do u do rules at the same time


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
and i wanted my money


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm already awake sooo


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
You start one, do rules quickly, finish and let a manager release staff, then hop onto the other one


[05-Jan-20 10:51 AM] emma;#1525
The second server will just start like 10 minutes later


[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] emma;#1525
I'd let managers do rules even if I knew they were good


[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] emma;#1525
LIke any of the managers on the senior vote


[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll do the last server


[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] emma;#1525

[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] emma;#1525
trey that's cheating


[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] emma;#1525
if katie is hosting 2 at once let her do the small server lol


[05-Jan-20 10:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think we can do 2 at once


[05-Jan-20 10:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Jan-20 10:53 AM] emma;#1525

[05-Jan-20 11:00 AM] emma;#1525

Such a nice mr


[05-Jan-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Mia legit gave people her whole promotion guide as if she was promoting someone to head. She leaked a lot of info


[05-Jan-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
And should be blacklisted


[05-Jan-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
Nia is the one that got herself blacklisted she can‚Äôt do shit


[05-Jan-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
That guy should block her


[05-Jan-20 11:43 AM] emma;#1525
ok then someone blacklist her


[05-Jan-20 11:43 AM] emma;#1525
i cannot as im leaving


[05-Jan-20 11:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I will.


[05-Jan-20 11:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Appeals or nah? @emma;


[05-Jan-20 12:00 PM] emma;#1525
I told nia she could send in an appeal in 30 days if she behaved well


[05-Jan-20 12:00 PM] emma;#1525
Which yes ik is a bit ironic considering I keep saying blacklists should be permanent


[05-Jan-20 12:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uh, I disagree.


[05-Jan-20 12:00 PM] emma;#1525
But I felt like telling her she could never appeal was just gonna make her troll or be rude


[05-Jan-20 12:00 PM] emma;#1525
So


[05-Jan-20 12:00 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm not against lying


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] emma;#1525
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Whatever, I think she's going to perform really badly.


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] emma;#1525
Eh she offered to remove the stuff from her resignation letter


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] emma;#1525
I told her that it didn‚Äôt matter at this point, she‚Äôd still be blacklisted


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We'll see.


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] emma;#1525
But it‚Äôs nice that she offered


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma, I don't know.


[05-Jan-20 12:01 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm not gonna condemn her straight away because who knows


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525
Let‚Äôs let her show us herself


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alrighty, but I don't really have much faith in her.


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
Same.


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs fine lol


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525
Never said I did


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525
I just don‚Äôt want to automatically be negative


[05-Jan-20 12:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like.


[05-Jan-20 12:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Jan-20 03:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
he appealed


[05-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But why?


[05-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
wdym?


[05-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know about you but I'm not sure if I can still appeal him.


[05-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
well he appealed a month ago so it's a little too late to be saying that now trey


[05-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, but I'd blacklist him again due to the account sharing.


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
oop


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
min


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
wasnt he the one thst purposely deleted ur themed session


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes, he was.


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hold up


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
then he account shared with amara???


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
mm mm mm


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
That was never proved, we never found out who deleted the TC...


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
o i thought u said he did


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
O-


[05-Jan-20 03:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
There was too many suspects and not enough evidence


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright.


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
i literally swear u said it was him


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
I wish we did find out who deleted it, but it was just too hard


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
rip


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But I'm still really suspicious because he did a major violation again after his appeal.


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
the account sharing?


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep, it's a security risk in my opinion.


[05-Jan-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
whats worse was that it was with a cb...


[05-Jan-20 03:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but I can't, over my dead body, really consider him to be functional of working as an LR.


[05-Jan-20 03:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He already proved to us that he can handle it once, and I doubt he's going to do well this time around now that we know about the account sharing.


[05-Jan-20 03:43 PM] katie#0200
trey take a look at the thing i attached on the investigation board


[05-Jan-20 03:43 PM] bman#0435
wait


[05-Jan-20 03:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
can't*


[05-Jan-20 03:43 PM] bman#0435
hes an lr?


[05-Jan-20 03:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok Katie.


[05-Jan-20 03:44 PM] katie#0200
not too sure what to think of it, i doubt it can be photoshopped on mobile..


[05-Jan-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435

[05-Jan-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She still admitted to account sharing with him, I still think she's trying to weasel her way back to the MR Team. @katie


[05-Jan-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry, but you can't twist that.


[05-Jan-20 03:45 PM] katie#0200
mhm, i'd still like to look further into the reporter and bubble actually being linked, since I can't actually prove it's not photoshopped, if you know what I mean? yeah it does look face but i have no solid proof amara was on that account and she's the reporter so


[05-Jan-20 03:45 PM] bman#0435
u can see the color change/rough edges from the extended edges to and the message


[05-Jan-20 03:46 PM] bman#0435
i think it wasnt photoshopped


[05-Jan-20 03:46 PM] bman#0435
they took the message and put it on a  same color in the back

trey look up


[05-Jan-20 04:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think it is her, she‚Äôs trying to play it off cause she knows what she said is bad cause literally the whole lounge was in shock, plus she has a history of cursing which I didn‚Äôt know she did

Cookies doxxed hadley in staff lounge i think @High Rank


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
If she did it by accident why is she telling Saab and not a HR


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
...


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
Maybe make that into a fire instead


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
So that‚Äôs a demotion


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
If she had did it by accident and told us right away


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah


[05-Jan-20 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe it could‚Äôve been different. But instead she tells Saab and doesn‚Äôt take responsibility for her actions


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] Polk#1596
@Cooqkie There wont be a suspension


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
We think she is hacked tho...


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
yall dont find it sus how literally she never acted this way and out of no where starts doxxing people and slurring...?


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
like thats a red card


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
i dont think cookies ever rly talked to hadley


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
I really think we need to look into it more


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
I think she is hacked


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] Polk#1596
Wait she is hacked?


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
so i think its someone that knew hadley and is tryna get back at her


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
shes def hacked


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why we are suspending her


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
cookies is hacked I think


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
she NEVER has acted this way


[05-Jan-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
Don‚Äôt fire her yet


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
and she promo suggested someone


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] Polk#1596
Cookie aren't you good friends with her? I think you should investigate


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
^


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
and she NEVER suggested a single person


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what she has been doing


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
me and cookie are the closest to her


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
cookie is closer tho


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
And why she will be the one to suspend her


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs already been questioning her


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] Polk#1596
Ok mb


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
So yeah no fire


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] Polk#1596
I just got online and saw that she said the n word lol


[05-Jan-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
She sent me this


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
And she never does promo suggestions


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] bman#0435
can i ask hadley if she knows who foxvyy is


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
And it doesn‚Äôt look like her


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
So foxy is suspect


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] Polk#1596
Oh hm, yeah that is suspicious


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] bman#0435
polk is that a yes or no


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not even a proper suggestion


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] Polk#1596
Though if she wasnt hacked she should be fired immediately


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] Polk#1596
For what?


[05-Jan-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
If she is hacked that‚Äôs what the suspension is for...


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
cookies bio says this


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
You can't ask me:
Joining your group 
Promotion suggestions
Friend requests
Personal information 
Asking for guides


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
**can't**


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs not really her it‚Äôs unfair to fire her for something she didn‚Äôt do


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
**promotion suggestions**


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
I read that wrong


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah if it is her fire


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
For sure


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
ya its def not her


[05-Jan-20 05:19 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
Trey


[05-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
You noob


[05-Jan-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
one time a girl claimed to be an MR who was "hacked" so I said "tell me the secret password for your account, which is an animal"


[05-Jan-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
and they actually put one


[05-Jan-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
so I knew it was a liar


[05-Jan-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
we could do that with cookie, bc if they go "I don't remember that being a thing?" then we know its them


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525
but if they put an animal its not cookies


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
Cookie should ask her that


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] bman#0435
whos hayley


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525
cookie isn't online


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] bman#0435
o


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525
and I don't want to make this wait


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
Well


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525
So someone else needs to do it asap


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
You can message her I guess


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I said this before, but I think she's playing this off.


[05-Jan-20 05:21 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

Cookie went to eat


[05-Jan-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Jan-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
She left the discord server for feeling guilty


[05-Jan-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525

@bman let me know if cookie is responding to you still


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
bc she hasn't answered me yet


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
ok


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hold up.


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435

[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435

[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
grammar


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How did she get to the hospital that fast?


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
Hi cookie, I've received a concern that you may have been hacked so I'm going to ask you the security question that we had all MRs submit answers to a while back.
Question: What is your favorite animal?
Please respond with your answer so we can verify your identity.


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
TREY OML


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
emma we should actually do that LOL


[05-Jan-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
how do u know her favorite animal


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
I don't


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
.


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
that's the trick


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
If they give one we know its fake


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
if they are confused then its *most likely* the real MR


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
wut


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
bc if its a liar or hacker they'll have to guess something


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Oh I seen


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
what if it is her fav animal tho


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
it's worked before okay


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
like


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
See*


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
But we never asked them to tell us that bman


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
ok


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Emma issmart !


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my favorite animal is myself


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
So you're right how would I know?


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
Why would she tell me thinking that it was real?


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
that's the point


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
see im smart sometimes


[05-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525

Cookies is so innocent, she must be hacked, highly doubt she'd ever do that

[05-Jan-20 05:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Who knows


[05-Jan-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; the only proof on foxy is that he was recommended by cookie who is hacked so that‚Äôs it. Then foxy messages me to recommend some other person. So it could be one of foxys friends


[05-Jan-20 05:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
or cares

:bloxton2: **REGARDING RULE 2** ‚ö†Ô∏è 

Hey, Bloxton Hotels Community. I'd like to announce that as of November 30th, 2019, cursing is not permitted in the general discussion channel of the Bloxton Hotels Discord. In addition to this, we have decided that any neglection to this rule will lead to an instant ban from the actual Discord server. On many occasions of it originally being a warning, many users have either gotten carried away, taken advantage of it by swearing many times, and use it to receive a reaction by being offensive. In response to that, we have decided to implement this rule due to those circumstances. We do greatly understand that this regulation may take some time to getting used to, but we do encourage you all to simply keep it clean for the server. A lot of users seem to miss this updated rule, leading to them getting banned. In light of that, you can simply show them a screenshot of this announcement for them to be aware on their messages in the future. I will also have it pinned considering that it is a major rule for the Bloxton Hotels Discord. In conclusion to this announcement, bypassing or intentionally to get around this violation is also a ban from the server. As always, the timeline to appeal for this is 30 days after the ban. Thank you for reading, and have a good rest of your night.

150 points


[05-Jan-20 10:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
you can choose to be chef?


[05-Jan-20 10:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
or is it experienced cashier


[05-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
experienced cashier


[05-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you have to attend another training to get chef


[05-Jan-20 10:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ooo


[05-Jan-20 10:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but its same 150 points?


[05-Jan-20 10:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
so 1 training to get to experienced cashier, 1 more training to get to chef


[05-Jan-20 10:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
then 300 to experienced chef

[06-Jan-20 12:38 AM] stacey#1000
Idk I‚Äôm still waiting


[06-Jan-20 12:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
then i was like


[06-Jan-20 12:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"oh shit i forgot to post this"


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait what


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] stacey#1000
They need to do a cat scan for possible internal bleeding. They so slow


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] emma;#1525
oh man


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] emma;#1525
was he in an accident?


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what happened to him again


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i tried to hear you on VC but it was muffled


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] stacey#1000
He fell down the stairs and hit his head really hard where he could have internal bleeding. Hopefully just a concussion


[06-Jan-20 12:39 AM] stacey#1000
So I walked to the hospital at 12:30am


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] stacey#1000
And I‚Äôm still here waiting at 1:39am


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Wait was this when u were on a call with us earlier?


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think it might be a concussion or maybe some kind of head damage @stacey


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] stacey#1000
If he legit has internal bleeding why they taking so long for a cat scan


[06-Jan-20 12:40 AM] stacey#1000
I think it‚Äôs just a really bad concussion


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
How did he fall? lost of balance?


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] stacey#1000
But idk they won‚Äôt give me answers.


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think that sounds fatal based on how you described it


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] stacey#1000
He like missed a step down the stairs


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oh no


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] stacey#1000
And now there is a huge dent in the vent thing


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think with recovery, he'll be okay


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] emma;#1525
aw well I hope everything turns out okay, if they're being annoying and making it take so long that most likely means that they don't believe he has internal bleeding


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but im not a doctor and dunno what happened soo


[06-Jan-20 12:41 AM] stacey#1000
I just hate how long the damn wait is


[06-Jan-20 12:42 AM] emma;#1525
hospitals suck


[06-Jan-20 12:42 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm gonna be here all night


[06-Jan-20 12:42 AM] emma;#1525
idk why they haven't learned how to be efficient yet


[06-Jan-20 12:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
they do @emma;


[06-Jan-20 12:42 AM] stacey#1000

[06-Jan-20 12:42 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[06-Jan-20 12:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
might just be a concussion


[06-Jan-20 12:43 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[06-Jan-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525

I told him to wait because it seems a little soon to give them the former MR role right away after their ban.


[06-Jan-20 11:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
If they want it, they pretty much have to win us over.

dead


[06-Jan-20 12:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I actually explained to him what happened and why we have decided to not reinstate him.


[06-Jan-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"First, you did mention that the paragraphs on how you feel towards Harriet and Kat was going to be sent out in a GC. If this is true, then that's technically leaking content based on the termination reasons from before. Despite Harriet knowing the information beforehand from Lauren, you still informed her on a few details about the cyberstalking announcement from November. In addition to this, Harriet is nowhere near the MR role, so telling her based on negative feelings with this included was not needed and should've been left off."


[06-Jan-20 12:16 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
so are we gonna deny him of the former role for now


[06-Jan-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Secondly, interacting with CBs is usually a recipe for disaster. I'm not really understanding on how after many months, Harriet was not blocked over the actual confrontation. I would compare this situation similar like a rash. A little weird, but take a second to think about this analogy. It's tempting to scratch, but having to do so just worsens the situation.  In many conversations shown from myself and yours,  it seems like you and Kat just went back and fourth with the name calling and having statuses about each other. It's not exactly a good image and gives off the wrong attention. I know this sounds really opinionated, but that is how I look at it on behalf of the HR Team. See where I'm going with this?"


[06-Jan-20 12:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, he's not really telling the truth here. @¬¢. ·É¶

I know he didn't really say it, but it felt like he knew.


[06-Jan-20 12:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even then, you can't blame "fake friends" based on the company's decision making.


[06-Jan-20 12:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's already aggravating with Nia's treatment of the whole situation, but him adding this announcement just made more fuel to the fire.


[06-Jan-20 12:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry, but I just really hate this "fake friends" card that former MRs pull.

I had to look closely at that LOL


[06-Jan-20 12:24 PM] stacey#1000
Plus...if she knew this before and supposedly has evidence why not tell us sooner. Instead she waits until she resigns


[06-Jan-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
LMAOOOO


[06-Jan-20 12:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[06-Jan-20 12:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Honestly, I'm really tired of MRs keeping secrets last minute.


[06-Jan-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
If she has evidence and it‚Äôs true I have no respect and don‚Äôt wanna give her former role


[06-Jan-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
If she legit waited this long


[06-Jan-20 12:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Why not


[06-Jan-20 12:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And this is one of the reasons why we're having a hard time deciding our next HR.


[06-Jan-20 12:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause many of the candidates suffer from different problems, or rather new.

That's pretty much a recipe for disaster.

[06-Jan-20 12:28 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I like her but apparently she doesn‚Äôt read PMs or something


[06-Jan-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
as a senior


[06-Jan-20 12:28 PM] stacey#1000
And doesn‚Äôt read PMs but


[06-Jan-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525

[06-Jan-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525

[06-Jan-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435

Madi has been a lot better about the PM thing


[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
And she doesn‚Äôt hang about cbs


[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435

never listens to mine


[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] emma;#1525
Maybe you just don‚Äôt command her respect


[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] emma;#1525
Which makes sense


[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause let's think about it.


[06-Jan-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
Madi is the best fit at this point

[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] stacey#1000
But she‚Äôs still better than other candidates


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] stacey#1000
What about Cory


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
we could at least ask her about it before jumping to conclusions ...


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Story, we technically can't do anything if there's none provided.


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Uhm


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
U could ask her


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But asking can definitely be an option.


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she wouldn‚Äôt lie


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
That‚Äôs my point


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cory is a decent choice.


[06-Jan-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Oo ya Cory


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't have many issues with him.


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I like Cory


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
Corey is a bitch is my new favorite song


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
Corey liked it too


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
‚ÄúCorey is a bitch, Corey is a hoe‚Äù


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but if we do decide to maybe shift our votes toward Madi we should ask her about that ^


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
I like Cory but he‚Äôs also friends with CBS


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Plus, he's very active with the community.


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
And he kinda acts like he‚Äôs not


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Newer ones?


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
He‚Äôs still in their servers


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
With special roles


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
With who, exactly?


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
Cory is a good option but he‚Äôs also in est and I still think having someone in Australian timezone is better


[06-Jan-20 12:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
hes actually rly close with the cbs


[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hm, alright.


[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
We can‚Äôt say yes to Cory


[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] stacey#1000
Okay no Cory then


[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
Bella?


[06-Jan-20 12:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She needs to work on her activity a bit though.


[06-Jan-20 12:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Way too new.


[06-Jan-20 12:38 PM] emma;#1525
Not really lol


[06-Jan-20 12:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Not everything is about activity


[06-Jan-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
Bella is not that new


[06-Jan-20 12:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
thing is


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
It‚Äôs against roblox terms


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
Plus we‚Äôve said ourselves that we can‚Äôt control what they do on other games


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
Then roblox should ban her story


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
Or that game


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525

[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that kind of gives the impression that we're watching their every move

Unless it‚Äôs alliances


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs not up to us and again every MR has bypassed


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôve seen so many of them do it


[06-Jan-20 12:39 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
It is


[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
it could just be that cookie went off the wire and decided once i accused her of being hacked that it made sense to go with it


[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
so she wouldn't be terminated for doxing


[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
because if she was hacked, she knew we couldn't term her for that


[06-Jan-20 12:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
that‚Äôs what I thought


[06-Jan-20 01:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[06-Jan-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
i explained this 4 minutes ago trey lol


[06-Jan-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
it makes 0 sense if i go first


[06-Jan-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
**Update. Please read.**

So it turns out that CookiesIsYummys was **not** actually hacked, but rather claimed to be hacked in order to not get in trouble for doxing an MR. Of course, this means that Cookies has been terminated from her position due to doxing and then lying about being hacked. It is a shame to see a good worker make this decision, but please do not contact Cookies about this.

I want to note something really fast. I know that we've been putting up a ton of MR terminations recently and it might look really bad and shocking. In reality, ever since we've started being more transparent we've had many more people feel comfortable coming forward with evidence concerning other MRs. While it is unfortunate that we've had to release many people from the MR team recently, it makes me feel so proud that you guys are doing the right thing and coming to us with your concerns. This team is going to function much better if we hold each other accountable. 

In additon, I want to remind everyone once again that if you ever accidentally break a rule, such as respawning all, sending a screenshot that includes confidential info, saying something over a VC, etc. your best bet of keeping your job is to come forward immediately. I am **so** proud to say that we've also had an increase in MRs coming forward to admit that they made a mistake, and that we've been able to let them go with a warning to be more careful since it was clearly a genuine mistake. If you guys are honest with us about your mistakes, we'll believe you didn't mean to do them. If you hide them and make us hear from an outside source, we're going to assume it was on purpose or that you aren't mature enough to take ownership of your actions. I'm so proud of all of you, and I know that you all are capable of great things if you give yourselves the chance.

@Cooqkie long story short, she posted a pic of hadley's face in SL then deleted it. We got a report from another MR about it. I contacted cookies and she was acting weird so I tested to see if she was hacked. She later said "this isnt cookies lol" which "confirmed" she was hacked. Today, she admitted to lying about being hacked in order to not get in trouble for doxing.


[06-Jan-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
Ok sending the letter now


[06-Jan-20 01:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So she wasn‚Äôt hacked when she said the n word?


[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
She was never hacked


[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
So yes


[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
She made a mistake


[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
And said she was hacked as a cover up


[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wow


[06-Jan-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
Instead of admitting it


[06-Jan-20 01:34 PM] stacey#1000
Like a responsible person


[06-Jan-20 01:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809

Last night


[06-Jan-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah her card should be deleted now


[06-Jan-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
Since she was terminated

:bloxton2: **TERMINATION OF FVLEUR** üì¢ 

Greetings, everyone. Unfortunately, we have made the decision of another MR termination of this year. After quite some time investigating, we have concluded that Fvleur, a Head of Services, was identified as a CB. I greatly understand that you all are in complete shock over this announcement, but I'd like to ask for you all to respect her privacy at this time. As we've mentioned before in previous announcements, do not confront this user over this circumstance, as it was handled already for today. In addition to that, do not share details regarding her termination of any users who are not in the Bloxton Staff Team. That is all I have to say, thank you for your time reading this from the staff announcement channel.

Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

**Shift Manager**

**Bloxton Hotels**

So that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt seen Emma in awhile


[06-Jan-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Imag told me something interesting that I agree with.


[06-Jan-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
CBs usually tend to be super active as an LR. Then around 1-2 weeks, they get completely inactive.


[06-Jan-20 01:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Rarely attend shifts, actually speak, or attend sessions at all.

[06-Jan-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
That she was hacked


[06-Jan-20 01:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
she's not banned?


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
itll make matters worse


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
we didng say we were banning her


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
she was just fired


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
shes not?


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525

[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
we didn't agree to blacklist her either


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
okie


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
if we want to fine but no one put up a vote for it


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But she doxed


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Don‚Äôt we blacklist for that


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
idk we havent had a doxer in a while


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] ethan;#0003
can we make a rule that people cant announce promos and "resignations" in there server


[06-Jan-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
If she‚Äôs coming back on a diff acc we need to know not to give her MR again


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
we cant control what other people do in their servers


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah we can


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
no-


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
we cant


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
Legit it‚Äôs in so many servers


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
thats kinda the point of the bloxton server


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
we dont announce promos or resignations


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
i mean ahmood posted porn in another server and got demoted for that right?


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt see an issue with it


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
people are not supposed to use other servers for bloxton discussion


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
posting porn is a BIT different bman


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
I let my server announce it


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
that was one of the original rules


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
well ig


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
we never made that a rule ethan


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
we said they can't make an unofficial bloxton server


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
.


[06-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
we never said they can't talk about bloxton stuff on other servers


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
there's a pretty big difference lol


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
it happened before you were an hr


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
way before


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
no it didnt


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
because i was literally there for those converstaions


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
Legit


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah because you know everything


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
People will do it regardless


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
yeah because you just don't like that im right most of the time


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
and you aren't mature enough to deal with it


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
but im over it


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
people used to get suspended for having bloxton discord servers


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm not changing it in my server I see no issue with it


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
they don't have bloxton discord servers


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
they're legit announcing 2 things about bloxton


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
i like how u said most of the time


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not Bloxton discord servers


[06-Jan-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
XDDDDDDDDDDD


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
2 things that we dont announce on ours


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
My server


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
@bman i know that im not always right


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
The only Bloxton part


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
like with the reaction things


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
Is announcing who was promoted


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
-dies on the inside bc bman was right and i was wrong-


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
I legit don‚Äôt see any issue


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
MHM


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
the MAIN reason why the bloxton server exists is so there is no bloxton things in other discords


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
THATS RIGHT


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I‚Äôll keep u guys updated on cookies


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
That is not true at all ethan


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
ok


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
well the main point is reports


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
we literally talk about bloxton on servers you are in all the fucking time lol


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk when she‚Äôs making a new account tho


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
thats not what i mean


[06-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I also don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs gonna be called


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
People started doing it when we no longer announced in announcements every time someone was promoted when it became an official Bloxton server


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
if she circumvents a blacklist, which she'll probably get, then she's going to be an enemy of bh


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
so


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
thats not fun


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
I don't see any harm in letting people announce it


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
if people don't want to see it, its up to them to leave those servers


[06-Jan-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
as long as servers aren't called "Bloxton XYZ" and/or people aren't obviously using it as a mini BH server then it's not really our problem


[06-Jan-20 02:03 PM] ethan;#0003
dam i need to delete my server then


[06-Jan-20 02:03 PM] ethan;#0003
it was called Bloxton XYZ


[06-Jan-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
that's been a rule since way before you were an HR ethan üôÑ


[06-Jan-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
you should know that

ethan do you not listen to anything i or stacey say anymore


[06-Jan-20 02:05 PM] ethan;#0003
you keep saying it was never a rule


[06-Jan-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
bc we both talked you through this


[06-Jan-20 02:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont blame you ethan


[06-Jan-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
that is not what i said


[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
you made a server just to prove you heard what i said


[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
and you're trying to say that i didnt say it now


[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
okay


[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
Emma: You can't have mini bloxton chats or servers that are called "bloxton" things


[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
i only find out about mrs when you put it in the mr announcements in bloxton server


[06-Jan-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
ethan: emma said you can have other bloxton servers


[06-Jan-20 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
can we atleast make them tell the truth


[06-Jan-20 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
if they are going to announce it


[06-Jan-20 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
instead of saying resigned


[06-Jan-20 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
put fired


[06-Jan-20 02:07 PM] emma;#1525
Well no because they can't say that people were fired


[06-Jan-20 02:07 PM] emma;#1525
as that is leaking

[07-Jan-20 11:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd blacklist him again for this.


[07-Jan-20 11:37 AM] bman#0435
i dont get why he can appeal a well needed blacklist


[07-Jan-20 11:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
We can't use the chat bubble proof


[07-Jan-20 11:37 AM] bman#0435

[07-Jan-20 11:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

@xM_inn no offense but if you don‚Äôt give us reasons then you can‚Äôt expect us to make informed comments


[07-Jan-20 11:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

When??


[07-Jan-20 11:40 AM] emma;#1525
There was reasons behind his appeal which I‚Äôll explain later


[07-Jan-20 11:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yes that doesn't mean I never told y'all..  it means I'm not explaining it again while I'm on phone


[07-Jan-20 11:41 AM] bman#0435
ty for coming @xAfroTrey


[07-Jan-20 11:41 AM] emma;#1525
I just searched your chats and see nothing about Loui from the past few days lol


[07-Jan-20 11:41 AM] emma;#1525
But okay minn


[07-Jan-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
Because he was appealed over a month ago...


[07-Jan-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
I thought you said he needed to be blacklisted for helping a CB be an MR


[07-Jan-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
No


[07-Jan-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
He was appeased before this happened


[07-Jan-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
Appealed


[07-Jan-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
Yeah ik


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] emma;#1525
But you said ‚Äúhe should be punished‚Äù for the bubbles thing


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
When?


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] emma;#1525
Since we have proof he was on the account

I'm not saying he shouldn't be punished I just sont remember

He just got banned again @xM_inn


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
He was impersonating MRs


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oh ok


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Can I blacklist him


[07-Jan-20 11:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
Blacklist him again


[07-Jan-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
No appeals this time since he had his chance


[07-Jan-20 11:44 AM] emma;#1525
Did we ever make a blacklisted list on the HR board


[07-Jan-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435

Scroll up for the conversation. I kind of got sassy at him, but he deserved it for his attitude. @xM_inn


[07-Jan-20 12:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also, he had the nerve to appear in Bman's interviews to do the same thing on an ALT.

[07-Jan-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525
It was a lot better than it sounds


[07-Jan-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525

@emma; nothing really happened, it was just the mrs that were in sl were basically body shaming lizzo posting twitter memes of her in the chat and laughing at them


[09-Jan-20 09:40 PM] bman#0435
then when i told them to stop, addie said something like "bman ur acting like were all going against u" but that just wasnt how it was at all lol


[09-Jan-20 09:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-Jan-20 09:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

oops i said "he"


[09-Jan-20 09:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im finna be gunned down for mistaking genders


[09-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey saying "its not body shaming it was just fucked up for a laugh"


[09-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
is really


[09-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
uh


[09-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
IRONIC


[09-Jan-20 09:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
eh


[09-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
shaming a body is body shaming whether it's a "joke" or not


[09-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
and it's really not something we should be encouraging


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
thing is tho


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
does this really deserve a mention


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk man


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] emma;#1525
im not saying it deserves a mention


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I don‚Äôt think it does


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] emma;#1525
it just scares me that you don't think that MRs body shaming is an issue


[09-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
because as long as they're "clearly joking" it's fine


[09-Jan-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
um what


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ugh nvm


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg are y‚Äôall talking about that Lizzo thing


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what happened, MR‚Äôs laughing about the jokes?


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
being made


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
apparently


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez apparently they were body shaming her and making fun of her


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
which only Bman saw as an issue


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh I completely agree, I don‚Äôt get why people body shame. not ur body so why make a comment


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] emma;#1525
just not something we need in staff lounge, there could be MRs with similar body types to lizzo who saw and got really hurt


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
even though she‚Äôs not here to see it, it‚Äôs sad people even do it


[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

A) She may not be a circumventor, considering that she does post **a lot** of YouTube videos about us. Normally, CBs couldn't do that.


[10-Jan-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
wdym they couldnt

For her YouTube channel, she has at least 5 videos.

it was always her plan to be an mr


[10-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
she told me she wished she could be an mr at some point


[10-Jan-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435

[10-Jan-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
and her doc changes


[10-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
and emma says she may or may not still be active


[10-Jan-20 09:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Hmm, there's Ava as well.


[10-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
emma is saying that shes technically still active but doesnt want to admit it


[10-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
ava is too risky to ask


[10-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
hadley is more trusted


[10-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why? Ava would more than likely just give me answers.


[10-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

(yet)


[10-Jan-20 10:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's a theme that i've realized from CBs tho


[10-Jan-20 10:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
personally, id have no problem in cbs using alts to secretly earn mr ranks, as long as nobody finds out & they're not gonna leak anything or abuse, it's just a shame that isnt the case


[10-Jan-20 10:22 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
fvleur was emmaa, and fvleur had the silver crown..


[10-Jan-20 10:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
like they get mr ranks for malicious intents


[10-Jan-20 10:22 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
alloe has sshf


[10-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
how is this any way positive


[10-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
I know, but it wouldn't be a problem if they weren't leaking or going to abuse?


[10-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
And nobody knew


[10-Jan-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
doesn't mean they'll do anything else


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
idk I don't think I'd trust them regardless bc of the previous behavior


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
maybe you're misunderstanding my point but oh well


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
especially amiee


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
amiee was the famous troller


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't understand it because there's nothing positive about it


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I think it's just bc of what happened with swan and sadder rly


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
them not leaking is a good thing


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but what about everything else


[10-Jan-20 10:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
after them just breaking our trust


[10-Jan-20 10:25 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
hard to trust any of the cbs when they say they wanna quit


[10-Jan-20 10:25 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
and try to be a staff


[10-Jan-20 10:25 PM] xM_inn#2821

[11-Jan-20 12:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
they haven‚Äôt really been like before in their old days of how the group used to be


[11-Jan-20 12:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it used to be the hustle and bustle go to restaurant.. now it‚Äôs just kinda there


[11-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont think theyve updated for awhile


[11-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they just keep rotating between restaurants they already have


[11-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809

Bro people wanted v5 back and now they want the old training center back

The whole point of a new version wasn't to go back..


[11-Jan-20 01:01 PM] babymariobebe#7563
People dislike change


[11-Jan-20 01:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
V5 was less laggy so that I understand, but the old TC? Whaaat


[11-Jan-20 01:02 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
yeah people dont like change but they gotta accept as we progress, things are going to keep getting different


[11-Jan-20 01:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm the old TC I do agree with


[11-Jan-20 01:03 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
i liked that the old tc was bigger


[11-Jan-20 01:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Much more space and was a lot of fun to decorate


[11-Jan-20 01:03 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
it seems a lil cramped in the new one, i like everything else it has to offer tho


[11-Jan-20 01:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What if the next TC had the best parts of both


[11-Jan-20 01:04 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[11-Jan-20 01:38 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 I like that idea but would other ranks be able to tag them too?


[11-Jan-20 01:38 PM] emma;#1525
Bc that‚Äôs why we haven‚Äôt had them taggable for the longest time, usually you cant disable other people from using role tags so it‚Äôs possible that they could be spammed


[11-Jan-20 01:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
make rule


[11-Jan-20 01:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
if you randomly tag them as lr


[11-Jan-20 01:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
without out REALLY GOOD REASON


[11-Jan-20 01:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

@bman good job but saying "we can't judge someone based on sessions and hotel activity" is kinda false bc thats literally 80% of what we judge them on üòÇ


[11-Jan-20 04:45 PM] bman#0435
tru


[11-Jan-20 04:46 PM] bman#0435
imma add "without knowing their limits"


[11-Jan-20 04:46 PM] emma;#1525
I would just say something about how we can't judge someone who doesn't go to a session and the hotel every single day, because it's not posisble for a lot of poeple to have that sort of activity

[11-Jan-20 04:49 PM] bman#0435
His reports are not inconsistent at all. He didn't report yesterday and that is all recently. That doesn't make his reports inconsistent. Inconsistency within reports would be he reports on the 3rd, per say, then his next report is the 15th. Also, we can't be judging people because they don't go to enough sessions or go to the hotel enough without knowing their limits or because they don't go to a session or the hotel every single day, it's not possible for a bunch of people to have that type of activity. I can say and admit that we can't always attend every single session on a daily basis. I have limits, and I know what it feels like to have those limits. Connor most likely has limits too. If you want to see some true inconsistent work ethics, Connor is not one to look at at all.

[11-Jan-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
@High Rank what do u guys think about having the inactivity-notices channel visible for seniors. itd make them have a better opinion when judging a players suggestion card. if we make it visible, that means they can read them but not react or anything else. personally, id think this would be helpful for them. react with a üëçüèª if we should make this change and üëéüèª if u disagree

I don't mind, I'd say it wouldn't be a bad idea.


[11-Jan-20 05:06 PM] Polk#1596
its not a bad idea, but i think we should stick having it only visible to hrs


[11-Jan-20 05:06 PM] Polk#1596
the recommendations from the seniors doesnt mean that much, its just supposed to help us see who they think is active

Nearly a year ago since I've departed @BloxtonHotel and the RBLX platform itself. Overall, I'm still grateful for what I've gone through while I was fully on the platform at the time. It's amazing how time flies quick, but we shall always be determined no matter what happe...

[11-Jan-20 11:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I WHAT


[11-Jan-20 11:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I NEVER LOGGED


[11-Jan-20 11:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I need to see this evidence


[11-Jan-20 11:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
How was what I did logging for the last one


[11-Jan-20 11:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I got away in that chase


[11-Jan-20 11:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the video only shows me getting away


[11-Jan-20 11:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
That‚Äôs not logging


[11-Jan-20 11:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
PLUS


[11-Jan-20 11:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
in that last log pic I lost connection and that was cleared up


[11-Jan-20 11:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so I got my evidence and my reasoning that it‚Äôs false cause the chase I got away, the video only shows me driving off and not be being in cuffs


[12-Jan-20 12:01 AM] emma;#1525
there's literally 4 different log cases they put through bloo


[12-Jan-20 12:05 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no one of them I got cleared up cause I lost connection so why would that count


[12-Jan-20 12:05 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and


[12-Jan-20 12:05 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
why would this video of me being in chase  count


[12-Jan-20 12:07 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I got away, I got away. That cop s probably salty cause when I was getting away that cop was coming towards me but I swerved to the other way and he hit thag farming stuff lol

I know some LRs and MRs (not stating names) that are REALLY close to CBs. Sharing this document will get CBs to not respect most of these conditions

Since CBs create a numerous amount of alternatives account, they are most likely to not have R$

I got Sydney (when she was active) facing the window instead of me (when I brang her to face me, she turned to face the window again) and Amara dancing during the whole interview


[12-Jan-20 02:22 PM] bman#0435
Once, I got Sophie in my office (üòî) and before the interview starts, she was whispering to an MR saying that she will resign. I asked her from what she will resign and she said "I will resign from school."

@High Rank Hey, so yxllowroses wants to receive the former MR role and I do need opinions regarding this. What's the reason for her role being removed? Well, she basically trolled at the hotel with Ziqna and Meowziii of almost one year ago. I did post the evidence here, however, it'll take some digging to find it. Considering that she stood up to Zion's recent behavior and staying relatively quiet of bad behavior for quite some time, I would like to see some opinions. üîµ  - She will receive the former MR role back. üî¥ - Declined. Pick one option over the other so we can get this through.

Honestly minn, Stapleton distracts me too much.

[13-Jan-20 11:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
if ur not gonna do it properly then ur unassigned


[13-Jan-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
u DM danny and lucky inactivity notice informing them to improve their inactivity and provide reasoning within 7 days of sending it, if they dont reply, u demote to lr after the 7 days. if they reply, comment the response on their card and i'll review it when i have time.


[13-Jan-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
any questions?


[13-Jan-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
about danny admin abusing, just forget about that cause hes probably gonna be demoted for inactivity anyways


[13-Jan-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
ok


[13-Jan-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
Bman thinks he doesn‚Äôt need to abide by others


[13-Jan-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
like when he SHOVES HIS TRAININGS IN AND STEALS MY MRS


[13-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; @bman were firing Danny for admin abuse and inactivity simultaneously without a notice since there was admin abuse involved


[13-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525
Now stop confusing each other


[13-Jan-20 12:02 PM] ethan;#0003
why wasn‚Äôt Danny fired when he abused them


[13-Jan-20 12:02 PM] emma;#1525

[13-Jan-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if we terminate danny now, i don't think we really have to deal with managing his activity


[13-Jan-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lemme drop my prewritten letter just in case


[13-Jan-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hello D4xnny, 

I am writing this letter today to announce your termination here at Bloxton Hotels, due to abusing your commands at the hotel. In addition to this, you have used the refresh command on all users on the server instead of the view command in connection to the exploiter, which is a violation of Bloxton's policies within the group. After some time investigating and observing your actions, you have been terminated from the Bloxton Staff Team. We are saddened that your journey has come to an end, but due to many of the violations listed in this letter, you have been demoted from your position. With that being said, we would like to thank you for your time as a Middle-Rank, and we genuinely hope you can take this opportunity to learn from your mistakes in another group. If you happen to have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to respond to this notice. I will be responding to your reply whenever I am available. Thank you for reading, and good luck on your future endeavors. 


Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

**Shift Manager**

**Bloxton Hotels**

can we terminate trey


[13-Jan-20 01:07 PM] katie#0200
yes


[13-Jan-20 01:09 PM] katie#0200
@xM_inn if a senior co-hosts does that count as attending or hosting


[13-Jan-20 01:10 PM] katie#0200
im guessing hosting


[13-Jan-20 01:10 PM] katie#0200
orr


[13-Jan-20 01:14 PM] emma;#1525
I think it counts as hosting but we shouldn‚Äôt let them do co hosting more than like 1/4th of the time


[13-Jan-20 01:14 PM] emma;#1525
Bc that‚Äôs basically cheating your way to doing half the work for full credit


[13-Jan-20 01:47 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[13-Jan-20 02:41 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; it‚Äôs really common to have interviews and trainings at the same time why is it just now an issue


[13-Jan-20 02:41 PM] ethan;#0003
its that no mrs go to interviews, they all go to trainings


[13-Jan-20 02:41 PM] ethan;#0003
they need to be asked to leave and come to interviews


[13-Jan-20 02:42 PM] emma;#1525
ok is that a big problem as long as they do it?


[13-Jan-20 02:42 PM] ethan;#0003
when i ping, most of the time nobody comes


[13-Jan-20 02:42 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 02:42 PM] bman#0435
i complain when i get 1 mr in each server


[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] bman#0435
and thats the only time


[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] bman#0435

[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
I bet it‚Äôs bc you had that 2 hour interview session ethan lmao


[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525

U CANT BE HOLDING MY SESSIONS OVER MY HEAD IF EMMA IS HOLDING THAT


[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 02:43 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 02:44 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 02:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Listen, if you're going on vacation, then great. I'm sure you'll have a great time aside from Bloxton. However, we are allowed to basically have two different sessions on the schedule.


[13-Jan-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; u wont even have to worry abt sessions for summer tho. while i had a 1 week vacation, im gon a be gone for 2 months lol


[13-Jan-20 02:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And like Emma said, early pings are usually a solution to the problem.


[13-Jan-20 03:03 PM] ethan;#0003
Do admin acts count as ranking your own passers?


[13-Jan-20 03:04 PM] ethan;#0003
That seniors hosted.


[13-Jan-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
No


[13-Jan-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs just part of hosting lol

[13-Jan-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
I approve


[13-Jan-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
Why would ranking your own passers count as an admin act


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
I think minn meant ranking other people‚Äôs passers


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] katie#0200
idk apparently it counts now


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
Not your own


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
Like if I ranked treys and Ethan‚Äôs


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes i mean ranking other peoples passers


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
not from ur own sessions


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] katie#0200
ohh


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
But ranking your own senior‚Äôs passers should be an expectation of hosting


[13-Jan-20 03:08 PM] katie#0200

Bman this is why you are not allowed to do things


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
Without


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
Permission


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
NOT LEAK OR K6THYY


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is my fault


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
And TREY DOESNT COUNT

[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
bman you dont do that


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
I DIDNT DO ANYTHING WITH LEAK OR K6THYY


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
U GUYS CANT READ


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
the LRs


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
but i refanked


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
You never asked about LRs


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think he means toad and others


[13-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
Bman I swear


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
after erthan shows me that it wasnt hilton models


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not leak


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] ethan;#0003
Bro


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
Bman you need to start waiting longer before doing things


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] ethan;#0003
You understand you just can't do that


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
That could have been a very ugly public case


[13-Jan-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
If those LRs noticed


[13-Jan-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait wdym by a public case


[13-Jan-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
If we fire LRs for no reason, especially ones that are sort of known, they could have released docs, made videos, complained to other LRs, etc


[13-Jan-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
And we literally have no case against them


[13-Jan-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
Bc technically what happened was admin abuse


[13-Jan-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
Accidental


[13-Jan-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
But still admin abuse


[13-Jan-20 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003
If someone is in a group with stolen models. You message EVERYONE involved with a letter saying to leave the group or be demoted. You also message the developers and owners of the group asking for them to please remove the models, if anyone of those people refuse, you blacklist them.


[13-Jan-20 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003
You NEVER jump to a demotion, EVER.


[13-Jan-20 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003
It doesn't matter what the case is, or how severe it is.


[13-Jan-20 05:29 PM] ethan;#0003
You ALWAYS need to check with at least one other HR.


[13-Jan-20 05:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the only thing is tho


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
some people usually go into the groups on purpose


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
It doesn‚Äôt matter trey


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] ethan;#0003
Most people in groups with stolen models, do not know they are stolen models.


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
You shouldn‚Äôt have told Bman to fire them right away either


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] ethan;#0003
That is why you ALWAYS need to tell them.


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't-


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] ethan;#0003
It was trey?


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No it wasn't..


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I barely said anything-


[13-Jan-20 05:30 PM] ethan;#0003
ok emma is just crazy like usual


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
Trey you told Bman the pajamas were a stolen model


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
Or the hanger or whatever


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] ethan;#0003
I dont beleve he did.


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] ethan;#0003
Trey found the original model.


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] ethan;#0003
It was not made my Baby or bear.


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs what Bman said lol


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
‚ÄúTrey said it was one‚Äù


[13-Jan-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
Bman is crazy tho so who knows


[13-Jan-20 05:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, I was kind of confused the whole time until I googled it.


[13-Jan-20 05:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
As far as I know, I didn't really say much.


[13-Jan-20 05:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@ethan; btw where are u going on vacation


[13-Jan-20 05:36 PM] emma;#1525
Ethan ur going on vacation again-


[13-Jan-20 05:37 PM] emma;#1525
Didn‚Äôt he literally just get back from a cruise


[13-Jan-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah lol


[13-Jan-20 05:37 PM] bman#0435
alright. im sorry. i didnt know we needed perms for that stuff, considering i wasnt informed of it before. trey did nothing too other than say that he also didnt know they were hilton models. ill be sure not to do that again


[13-Jan-20 05:39 PM] emma;#1525
You don‚Äôt need perms to fire LRs


[13-Jan-20 05:39 PM] emma;#1525
I think you just need to slow down a bit Bman lol


[13-Jan-20 05:39 PM] emma;#1525
Most situations aren‚Äôt as clear or obvious as they may look, it‚Äôs okay for a demotion to be delayed so that you can get more info or be sure of what you‚Äôre doing


[13-Jan-20 05:40 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey im not going on vacation

[13-Jan-20 05:45 PM] bman#0435

I hit her car


[13-Jan-20 05:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And made it flung once


[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it was funny cause she had a gun so she walked so much from where her car was


[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] bman#0435
trello is slow


[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause she didn‚Äôt wanna reset


[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] bman#0435
and it slows down my computer


[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] bman#0435
which is annoying


[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] bman#0435

[13-Jan-20 05:46 PM] ethan;#0003

[13-Jan-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
LRs are asking for it and soon everyone will want a role for whatever timezone they are in


[13-Jan-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
So the roles should be deleted sometime

head of suspended role was somehow createed


[14-Jan-20 01:45 AM] Beartikal#9760
i never knew of its existence so i gave it to saab as a joke


[14-Jan-20 01:45 AM] Beartikal#9760
but remove it now


[14-Jan-20 01:45 AM] Beartikal#9760

i didnt create that role though


[14-Jan-20 01:45 AM] Beartikal#9760

[14-Jan-20 01:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think it was created ages ago as a joke


[14-Jan-20 01:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
no one has had it in a while now i believe


[14-Jan-20 01:58 AM] Beartikal#9760
also the story of the roblox "OOF" sound is weird


[14-Jan-20 01:58 AM] Beartikal#9760
roblox says they took it off a 'fair' use website


[14-Jan-20 01:58 AM] Beartikal#9760
and Tommy Tallarico, the original creator of the OOF sound, claims roblox stole it from an illegal website

[14-Jan-20 01:18 PM] emma;#1525
@bman I promoted Little because she's actually very active lol and has had very consistent activity lately


[14-Jan-20 01:18 PM] emma;#1525
you can't just compare little and fretful because they've both been rank 10 for  a long time

fretful hasn't been to a session since NOVEMBER (excluding the two from the 11th and 12th)

no


[14-Jan-20 01:19 PM] emma;#1525
how is that showing that she's back to active activity


[14-Jan-20 01:19 PM] bman#0435
thats literally a lie


[14-Jan-20 01:19 PM] emma;#1525
i just said excluding the one from 1/11 and from 1/12

so 3 in the past 2 months


[14-Jan-20 01:20 PM] emma;#1525
Bman that's not returning to constant activity lol


[14-Jan-20 01:20 PM] emma;#1525
She'll need to be active throughout the next couple of weeks for me to support it


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] bman#0435
i never said she had constant


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] bman#0435
activity


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] bman#0435
i said she occasionally attended sessions


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
that's not even activity


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
that's like


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
popping in every once in a while


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[14-Jan-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
if someone is less active than me at sessions you know it's not good üòÇ


[14-Jan-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not saying she shouldn't be promoted ever, but I think giving her another 2-3 weeks to see if she's really coming back or if it's just a fluke would be the safest and most responsible thing for us to do as HRs


[14-Jan-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
if she can attend like 2-3 sessions a week (less than required for managers) then I'll agree


[14-Jan-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn let me know who wins üòÇ

[14-Jan-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm i haven't really said anything about fret at all but i do kind of agree with emma here


[14-Jan-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also i'm not exactly seeing her at the hotel that much


[14-Jan-20 01:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
has potential but i think she just needs to kick it up a notch


[14-Jan-20 01:53 PM] bman#0435
she went to the hotel on sunday


[14-Jan-20 01:53 PM] bman#0435
also this wasnt a win or lose thing lol


[14-Jan-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 01:57 PM] bman#0435
wdym


[14-Jan-20 01:57 PM] emma;#1525
when it takes an hour to complete one session


[14-Jan-20 01:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that sounds like responses about jack @emma;


[14-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
and at least 15-30 minutes for servers to fill back up

[14-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
be


[14-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
challenging


[14-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
your 9:30 will just be smaller


[14-Jan-20 01:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's going to be tough


[14-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
bc there wont be time for servers to fill up


[14-Jan-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
lol


[14-Jan-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think she might've did that to avoid being flung, i'm not sure


[14-Jan-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
i saw it


[14-Jan-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause there's two places to stay away from them


[14-Jan-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) the chairs in the lobby


[14-Jan-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) the rock


[14-Jan-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) the rock


[14-Jan-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
is it me or is the exploiters usually invisible now when the fling other users


[14-Jan-20 02:18 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 02:48 PM] ethan;#0003

[14-Jan-20 02:48 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
i asked her where it was


[14-Jan-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 02:49 PM] ethan;#0003

[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
She still never did....?


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Nope.


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Never did.


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
She forgot


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
And I told her


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
To put it up


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Jan-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
I told her to make a habit to do it as soon as she finishes sessions


[14-Jan-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
To get into that routine


[14-Jan-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Jan-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
@bman Also I don't really like that she's announcing that in front of LRs. It's supposed to be something only MRs know about. I think it was a genuine mistake so you can verbally warn her, but kinda surprised she didn't know better.


[14-Jan-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
did she ask for permission before hosting one?

Aren't MR's supposed to tell people to put clothing on if they are naked.


[14-Jan-20 08:55 PM] ethan;#0003
And if they refuse then they kick.

[14-Jan-20 08:55 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 08:55 PM] ethan;#0003
They are supposed to tell them.


[14-Jan-20 08:55 PM] ethan;#0003
If they refuse then its a ban.


[14-Jan-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
But if its like a CB with no clothing, that is another story.

Greetings, it has come to the HR‚Äôs team attention that recently lots of players have been getting reported for no clothing. It has also come to our attention that you are not asking the players to put on clothing, instead instantly kicking and requesting a ban for that player. For future instances, you are required to tell every player to please put on clothing if they do not already have. If the player still is refusing to put on clothing after you already asked, you are allowed to make a ban request for that player. The only time you ARE allowed to kick a player who does not have clothing on is for CB‚Äôs.


[14-Jan-20 09:00 PM] ethan;#0003

[14-Jan-20 09:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003
but its probaly a CB


[14-Jan-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Hateful username"


[14-Jan-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003

[14-Jan-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not really a big deal


[14-Jan-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525

[14-Jan-20 09:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's clearly intended


[14-Jan-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
mrs have reported names like


[14-Jan-20 09:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Robux or not

[14-Jan-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
thats what im kinda trying to refer to


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Idk


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That could set off people in the US the wrong way


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Like once a staff had a username that said something against another game


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:shrug:


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Oh, I thought inappropriate usernames had to like bypass in them, oops


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
and an mr tried to report him


[14-Jan-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That can count Story

[14-Jan-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:hamsterrage:


[14-Jan-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
basically the way I see it is we shouldn't be allowing usernames for people who are CLEARLY trying to mess with us and start drama. No reason to let someone be in our hotel if their usernames are going to be clearly offensive and are just intended to hurt people


[14-Jan-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
so "usasucks" would qualify if it's clearly a throwaway account for someone to be rude on


[14-Jan-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's pretty much disrespectful towards a country sooo


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if it said ‚Äúbloxtonisnotfun‚Äù would that be inappropriate or no then


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
i mean i'd personally ban it lol


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Just a rude username


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
their sole goal is to ruin our name


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
so


[14-Jan-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah true

Also the madi your talking about is that starfully?


[14-Jan-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
Because she already has 3 or 4 warnings


[14-Jan-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
For not reading dms


[14-Jan-20 09:31 PM] ethan;#0003

[14-Jan-20 09:44 PM] emma;#1525
@Hilton Founder Please work on improving our anti-exploits, we've had so many lately that have been ruining servers and it's concerning


[14-Jan-20 09:46 PM] bman#0435
@emma; i have no clue y tate called u to check a trainee lol


[14-Jan-20 09:46 PM] bman#0435
i couldve done it if he asked me


[14-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
@bman he said you were being fake afk


[14-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
and that he did ask you


[14-Jan-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
i wasnt fake afk lmao


[14-Jan-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
i was real afk


[14-Jan-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
then came back


[14-Jan-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
he didnt ask


[14-Jan-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
lol


[14-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
ok well both you and alex went AFK at the same time then


[14-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[14-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
not sure what you wanted him to do lol


[14-Jan-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
wait??????????????


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
didnt you literally complain that i made ur session take longer like a few hours ago


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
make up ur mind


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
do you want ur sessions to be efficient or not


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
maybe don't have the two highest ranking people on a server go AFK at the same time...? without leaving anyone else in charge..? lol


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
I WENT AFK FIRST


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
TO SHOWER


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
THEN SHE WENT AFK


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
WHILE I WAS AFK


[14-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
why tf are you showering during a session


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] bman#0435
because i have time to????????


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
you're supposed to be watching your server...???


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
it's one thing to be on netflix or youtube or your phone


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A lot can happen in 10 minutes


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
but literally off your computer for 10-20 minutes is not very responsible lol


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
what if an exploiter came


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] bman#0435
sorry for showering...?


[14-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
shower after your session...?


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
everyone is asleep...?


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
20 minutes usually gets you booted out anyways soo


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
i have an auto-clicker


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
then don't plan a session during the only time you have to shower...?


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
i plan sessions for when i have time to do them


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
bman it's literally not okay to intentionally be gone from your server for that long


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait wait wait


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
because u literally know how limited my time is


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
you have a responsibility to actually HOST


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
so if you don't have time to host for real then don't half ass it and leave someone else in charge the whole time and expect everything to go okay


[14-Jan-20 09:55 PM] emma;#1525
especially with only one manager on


[14-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
it wasnt even the whole time lol


[14-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds like a lot on their shoulders ngl


[14-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause they have to do things such as switch rooms in order to supervise


[14-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
On top of that


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
shouldnt they be doing that in the first place


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
SHOULDN'T YOU?


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
your job isn't just to rank lmao


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
it's to supervise as well


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
and be available if things come up


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
ya im available lol


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
not if you're in the shower


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You said you were showering fam


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
never said id be available 100% of the time


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
.


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
.


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
.


[14-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
you're supposed to be...


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
i always make sure to have trey or a senior come if i have to be gone for most of my session for UNFORSEEN circumstances


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
or another HR


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
bc it's not okay to leave managers in charge for that long


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
that's why we don't allow them to host


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
we dont want them to be in charge of everything


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] bman#0435
it wasnt even over 10 minutes


[14-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
it doesn't really matter lol


[14-Jan-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's still a little concerning


[14-Jan-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like I said before, it seems like a lot of tasks one single Management has to do.


[14-Jan-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Switching rooms a lot of the time, checking for chatlogs depending how much trainees there are, opening doors, etc.


[14-Jan-20 10:00 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey did tate win a laser battle at your ints


[14-Jan-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ye


[14-Jan-20 10:01 PM] bman#0435
trey how is opening doors a hard thing lol


[14-Jan-20 10:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't say it was.


[14-Jan-20 10:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:shrug:


[14-Jan-20 10:02 PM] bman#0435
k well sorry for showering during my session


[14-Jan-20 10:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
However, with other things I've mentioned, that seems like a lot of multitasking.


[14-Jan-20 10:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And u still smell bad @bman


[14-Jan-20 10:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Jan-20 10:03 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jan-20 10:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Naw man


[14-Jan-20 10:04 PM] bman#0435

Hello. Can you help me please?


[15-Jan-20 06:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Hello, I would like to talk to you about some applications that you've passed.
When I was ranking applicants, I realise you were passing people with very very less detail, whereby there are only 3 sentences. OR, some general copy pasted applications.
Firstly: https://trello.com/c/mxlPgcGC/291382-kittycat6835-412620823
For this applicant, her detail for Q2 and Q5 is really insufficient, with only 3 very short sentences for both of them.
Secondly: https://trello.com/c/Mhj1vww7/291387-mrmrssloth-136722873
The issue is the same for this application, very less detail, and the sentences she gave sound more like a sentence by itself. "I would clean. Help everyone. And make sure nobody trolls." can become "I would clean, help everyone and make sure nobody trolls."
Thirdly: https://trello.com/c/puR91udf/291386-applechipsaregood-1407888420
The issue with this application is that he/she has all those experiences, but it's all under an account which is created on 11 Jan, why not the main, as you can join much more groups on Roblox now, as compared to previously. Also, never once visited Bloxton, as he/she doesn't have the badge.
Fourth:https://trello.com/c/g8MsGhRP/291403-butihoori-1342277672
Same issue with 2nd application, but only applies to Q2.


[15-Jan-20 06:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[15-Jan-20 06:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[15-Jan-20 12:49 PM] Polk#1596
did this dude message u guys something similar?


[15-Jan-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
i dont rank low account ages, so one time he asked me to rank his account


[15-Jan-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
i ranked the account because i assumed it was just his alt and he asked right away after my interviews


[15-Jan-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
but now he asked for the second time and used the "my sibling" excuse


[15-Jan-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
its kinda suspicious


[15-Jan-20 01:17 PM] bman#0435
didnt message me


[15-Jan-20 01:18 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jan-20 01:18 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jan-20 01:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-Jan-20 01:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Un-rank him, I don't trust his ambitions at all. @Polk


[15-Jan-20 01:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's also on the CB list, so big red flag here.


[15-Jan-20 01:22 PM] ethan;#0003

SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT - PLEASE READ

Regarding anyone running Windows 10 on their device:

The NSA has released an official, public statement urging everyone to update their Windows devices as soon as possible. An exploit has been identified in the current version of Windows 10 that can allow malicious software to be automatically installed on your computer, under the guise of approved Windows updates. 

This means that very soon, hackers will be developing tools to be able to take control of and install malicious software to over 900 million PCs worldwide, with little to nothing that can be done to stop or remove the infected software due to the system believing it is from an approved Windows Update.

The NSA and US Department of Defense urges everyone on Widows 10 to update their computer IMMEDIATELY, as a fix for the exploit has already been released. Again, failing to update now will put your machine at extreme risk in the future.

To update, click the windows logo in the bottom left, click the cog, go to "update and security" and press "check for updates."

Links to the OFFICIAL NSA statement and a detailed news report are included below for you to read.

Windows 10 Has a Security Flaw So Severe the NSA Disclosed It
In a shift toward transparency, the National Security Agency announced a bug that could have left over 900 million PCs vulnerable to attack.

When I ended interviews Theerick tp'ed gabriel out of the building, I did not get any video of him actualy doing it but there is photos of chatlogs and of gabriels reaction to him doing it. Is this suspension worthy or not since it was after interviews?

were there interviewees there


[15-Jan-20 02:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[15-Jan-20 02:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Just mrs but like, they still cant do that


[15-Jan-20 02:46 PM] ethan;#0003
doesnt matter mrs or not


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] bman#0435
^


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc it was only mrs


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
doesnt matter if there are guests or not


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
its still admin abuse


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
id do a written warning


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
he is a new MR


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] bman#0435
not rly


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
you should just give him a verbal warning


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
not that new


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] bman#0435
^


[15-Jan-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
I think its been like 3 weeks


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] bman#0435
hes been here long enough to know how to behave at sessions lol


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
well


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
he doesnt deserve a suspension for something like that.. there wasnt any interviewees there


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
and we even said you are allowed to be immature after the session is over


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] bman#0435
ye


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
admin abuse is going a bit far, so i think you should just give him a friendly reminder aka a verbal warning


[15-Jan-20 02:48 PM] bman#0435
we do laser wars after sessions are done lol


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] ethan;#0003
Is verbal not logged in #warnings ?


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
something emma initiated


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; no


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Polk#1596
verbal is like u give them a warning but it isnt logged


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait


[15-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
dont we


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Polk#1596
ik i found out after i read her announcement!!


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
log it anyway but put that it was verbal


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
i dont think so


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so we know they got warned and dont forget


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
well thats technically a written warning


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Polk#1596
no


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
nononononono


[15-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Polk#1596
we give verbal warnings so they wont do it again


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Polk#1596
if they do it again there will be more serious consequences


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc if it says verbal we dont treat it liek a written one but i thought we wrote them down anyway and said if they were verbal or written


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so we dont forget about the warning


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like if they were told in the warning


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if u do it again u get a written warning


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but like wot if we forget


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
about that


[15-Jan-20 02:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and they do it again


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596
you could write it in a word document or something, but you cant log it in the warning channel i dont think


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596
its for official warnings


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435
i think the only time u would write a verbal in there


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
waiyt buy


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but*


[15-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435
is if its like


[15-Jan-20 02:53 PM] bman#0435

Hello (username),

Recently, we have noticed that you have been inactive at Bloxton Hotels. With your current MR position, we cannot have inactive MR's in our group. After notifying you about your inactivity we have not noticed an increase in it. Due to this you have been demoted from your current position at Bloxton Hotels. If you want to regain your rank at Bloxton Hotels you will have to earn it again. Thank you for working with us, have a nice day. <: (If you have any questions/concerns please DM me)

Hello LuckyShamrock1210,

I am messaging you today to check in on your activity at Bloxton Hotels. The HR team had been monitoring your activity and deemed you as inactive. Your activity currently does not meet our standards. You are currently ranked as an "11 | Management". If you do not respond within seven days after this letter had been sent, you will be demoted to your LR position which was "7 | Receptionist". With your response, we would like a valid reason for your inactivity too. Thank you for your time.

She was banned for inappropriate username and its not a valid reason because her username is TheGirlSannaZoo


[16-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Beartikal#9760

its not necessarily single people who are the issue


[16-Jan-20 08:47 PM] emma;#1525
its that 5 HRs are planning sessions 5-6 days in advance


[16-Jan-20 08:47 PM] emma;#1525
like i literally don't know if im free until day of


[16-Jan-20 08:47 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
At least im not the issue


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Owo


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] emma;#1525
so i either have to hope someone will give me a server or squeeze something in


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye same


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I always only put sessions 1 hr in advance


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] emma;#1525
thats why i wish we had a policy in place where you couldnt plan that far ahead


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Cause i know that time i can be free


[16-Jan-20 08:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But consequence is max 2 servers

@xAfroTrey kinda want to revisit zhoulie‚Äôs ban for a second


[16-Jan-20 10:34 PM] emma;#1525
Obviously what she said was pretty gross lol


[16-Jan-20 10:35 PM] emma;#1525
But i wouldn‚Äôt class it as ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù like we would more sexually explicit things (which have been the subject of most, if not all, inappropriate bans)


[16-Jan-20 10:35 PM] emma;#1525
If you feel really strongly that she needs to be banned that‚Äôs fine lol just wanting to see your side a bit more


[16-Jan-20 10:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Eh, I guess I'll share my side.


[16-Jan-20 10:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so when she first mentioned that sentence, I thought "puss" was short for pussy. And that prompted for me to ban her.


[16-Jan-20 10:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It also was a bit concerning how she then said "the goop from my pink eye is so flavourus". I thought it was unsettling and very uncomfortable.


[16-Jan-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
I mean I agree it‚Äôs very gross lol


[16-Jan-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
Would you have still banned her if you knew that she didn‚Äôt mean puss in that way


[16-Jan-20 10:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hm, probably not. I thought about it in that context since she was talking about eating it.


[16-Jan-20 10:56 PM] emma;#1525
so...


[16-Jan-20 10:56 PM] emma;#1525
do you want to unban her then...


[16-Jan-20 10:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm.


[16-Jan-20 10:57 PM] emma;#1525
if she was only banned bc you thought puss meant pussy then it‚Äôs a false ban lol


[16-Jan-20 10:57 PM] emma;#1525
But if you have other reasons for wanting her to stay banned that‚Äôs fair


[16-Jan-20 10:58 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey hellooooooo


[16-Jan-20 11:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The only thing that annoyed me after the ban was her saying "#BringZhoulieBackToHilton!!!" since it felt like she didn't really care on what she has done.


[16-Jan-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs really up to you, I don‚Äôt want to tread on your toes about this if you feel like she should stay banned


[16-Jan-20 11:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
However, I don't mind having her unbanned. But I'd definitely have her ban lifted for now.


[16-Jan-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
You do what you think is the best option lol


[16-Jan-20 11:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True, let's see if she does better this time around.


[16-Jan-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525
So ur unbanning her?


[16-Jan-20 11:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, I think I'll settle with that. I'm thinking of warning her after what went down.


[16-Jan-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
I never know if you actually stopped typing or if your phone just takes so long to send things lmao


[16-Jan-20 11:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, I had to think for a bit.

[17-Jan-20 03:30 PM] emma;#1525
does bliss have to cancel his session


[17-Jan-20 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
maybe because all the mrs are bloxton all day everyday and don't both attending the game nights


[17-Jan-20 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
no interviews are short

but yeah his interviews too


[17-Jan-20 03:30 PM] emma;#1525
that's really a double standard lmao


[17-Jan-20 03:30 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Jan-20 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821

u planned 43 mins ago


[17-Jan-20 03:32 PM] xM_inn#2821

and when i came on to disc i didnt see the ping


[17-Jan-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
look if you're not gonna be upset that bliss is hosting ints you cant be upset about mine. Saying "ints are shorter" is bs. Yes they are but it's still "taking mrs away from the gamenight" lol im sorry there was a mixup but can we at least be consistent..?


[17-Jan-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
also ethan hosted 2 hour ints once so who knows how long they will take üòÇ

im not mad about ethans 2 hour session i think its hilarious


[17-Jan-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
it was also imag's fault lol


[17-Jan-20 03:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
there's a difference, bliss asked for permission and to check if it was okay, in which i allowed him since interviews take roughly 30-40 minutes, but ig it doesn't matter now ill just adjust the game night


[17-Jan-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
you dont need to adjust


[17-Jan-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
we'll be done 15 minutes into the gamenight time


[17-Jan-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
the heads will probably be done earlier


[17-Jan-20 03:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oi oi


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] emma;#1525
also why is it okay for interviews that take 40 but trainings take 45 and that's not okay...?


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] emma;#1525
im just so confused as to these double standards lol


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
interviews started at xx:20, ur trainings started at xx:30


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
trainings usually take an hour


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] emma;#1525
mine rarely take more than 45 mins


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] emma;#1525
RARELY


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
and ur second servers?


[17-Jan-20 03:50 PM] emma;#1525
if they take longer I always join them to see what is up


[17-Jan-20 03:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
ok well im gonna go on stapleton for a bit

guys can we make a doc or announcement clearing up the confusion with whats bypassing and whats not and what MRs need perms for

@xM_inn bruh all this grief towards me hosting during ur gamenight and now its 15 minutes late anyways


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
@katie i still think we need to make a huge rule guide like most other groups have


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
bc so many of our rules are only known by like half the MRs


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] katie#0200
yes i agree


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
and the lrs don't know


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
but no one wanted to host an HR meeting for that


[17-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
so


[17-Jan-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
gonna put up a form for people to tell us rules they think need clarification


[17-Jan-20 04:52 PM] katie#0200
@High Rank Should we make a huge rule book/handbook or something? Most groups have them, and I believe there's confusion with the rules across the LR and MR team such as what's bypassing and what's not, and what MRs need perms for and how sessions work for those who are new etc

y'all we should honestly make an HR google drive

that would be so much easier

[17-Jan-20 05:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
We really need one


[17-Jan-20 05:12 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Would you all like/feel comfortable with having an HR google drive? It would only contain things like forms (so we don't have to share responses every time) and then things like the rule handbook katie suggested, possible promo guides (since they're all shared with us anyways), and other things that we all need access too that may be subject to editing. It's annoying having to share all of you and remember all of your emails so I think it would make collaboration a lot easier. Thoughts?

[17-Jan-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank I just added everyone who's emails I have to the HR shared folder. If you DON'T see it, then **DM** me your email. Please use one specifically made for Roblox or one that doesn't give away your personal info. The intent for this folder is to mainly contain things that aren't super confidential, so in the case we have asen2.0 (not that I'm even thinking any of you would ever leak) it isn't a big deal. Feel free to add whatever you want to it.

:bloxton2: **TERMINATION OF ADORICALL** üì¢

Greetings, Bloxton MR Team. The HR Team would like to inform you that we have made the decision of dismissing another member from the Bloxton Staff Team of this month. After some moments investigating their incident, we have concluded that adoricall, a Head Receptionist, has had various instances of her behaving inappropriately to numerous users of the Bloxton community. I greatly understand that you all are in complete shock over this announcement, but I'd like to ask for you all to respect her privacy at this time. As we've mentioned before in previous announcements, do not confront this user over this circumstance, as it was handled already for today. In addition to that, do not share details regarding her termination of any users who are not in the Bloxton Staff Team. One final thing, we also request for you all not to engage in raunchy or inappropriate conversations of intimate relationships in Bloxton Hotels, it will bring quite a lot of consequences to the table regarding your employment of the group. Thank you for your time reading this from the staff announcement channel, and we hope you'll have a safe rest of your night.


Best Regards, 

*xAfroTrey*

tough shit but


[17-Jan-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525
I mean she‚Äôs considered a minor by most countries


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
So I kind of agree


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] ethan;#0003
Tell her, if anyone message her hate to tell you.


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] ethan;#0003
Because that is just unacceptable.


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
I wouldn‚Äôt say she was fired for sexting


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
üò¨üò¨


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
Just my professional opinion


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i dunno emma


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
She‚Äôs only 16


[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[17-Jan-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000

Just take out the word raunchy


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
In your announcement


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
are you on google drive? @stacey


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
Then it‚Äôs a lot better


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
you go to google drive


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
isn't the legal age in the UK 16


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003

[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey go to shared with me


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
I did


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
or search it up on the serach bar


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
or go to your email


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah but it‚Äôs an International server


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause that's not a minor


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
it will give you a direct link


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
She‚Äôs still a minor that‚Äôs just the age of consent


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
That doesn‚Äôt mean we need to publicize that she was being raunchy


[17-Jan-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well alright then


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
Its still sexting, doesnt matter age of consent or not


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
Saying she was behaving inappropriately is just fine


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
But we don‚Äôt need to be more specific than that


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
The most recent thing shared with me is the stupid  meme thing


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
Ok I‚Äôll check again


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
One final thing, we also request for you all not to engage in inappropriate conversations of intimate relationships in Bloxton Hotels, it will bring quite a lot of consequences to the table regarding your employment of the group.*


[17-Jan-20 09:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[17-Jan-20 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
Send me a link to it @emma;


[17-Jan-20 09:34 PM] bman#0435
@emma; if someone says "That is why you should hire me!" within q5, is that even valid to pass or no


[17-Jan-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
because were technically asking for a reason, not a conclusion


[17-Jan-20 09:35 PM] stacey#1000
Found it all good @emma;


[17-Jan-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435
I think you should hire me over the others because, I'm not here to troll. I'm not here to scam. I'm here to help this hotel.


[17-Jan-20 09:37 PM] stacey#1000
Eh


[17-Jan-20 09:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No.


[17-Jan-20 09:37 PM] stacey#1000
Not really no


[17-Jan-20 09:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The detail isn't very good in their sentences.


[17-Jan-20 09:37 PM] bman#0435
k because anna and emily are passing the wildest applications e.e


[17-Jan-20 09:37 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 09:40 PM] bman#0435

They are selfish and it‚Äôs unfair to other seniors that need apps


[17-Jan-20 09:43 PM] bman#0435

I'm just saying we usually write letters a lot.


[17-Jan-20 09:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well, in that case.


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] emma;#1525
ya bc i dont do shifts so its my way of making it up to y'all üòÇ


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm just going to kill two birds with one stone.


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
And passing apps that are clearly copied answers and with grammar errors. They do apps legit in 5 seconds and don‚Äôt even read it I‚Äôve seen it


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] bman#0435
omer passed an app with the nobody is perfect


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] bman#0435
:facepalm_blob:


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] ethan;#0003
OMER PASSES SO MANY APPS THAT ARE STOLEN ANSWERS


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] emma;#1525
maybe we need to put up a reminder to all the seniors


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I said announcement


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; does he need a warning too


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
Because if we announce


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] ethan;#0003
No


[17-Jan-20 09:47 PM] emma;#1525
I mean they defo need letters if you guys are specifically noticing them


[17-Jan-20 09:48 PM] ethan;#0003
Omer needs a reminder to read the copied answer sheet


[17-Jan-20 09:48 PM] ethan;#0003
but emily and anna need to actually read them


[17-Jan-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
OMER LITERALLY GOT 2 APPS BEFORE ANNA STARTED AGAIN


[17-Jan-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435

THE FUCK


[17-Jan-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
its happened onmultiple occasions trey


[17-Jan-20 09:48 PM] emma;#1525
bc all they do is sessions and shifts


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] bman#0435
so im leaning towards written


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
ITS BEEN LIKE 5 DAYS


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
tbh i wouldnt be surprised if they both do fake shifts


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
like with what roseh did


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
THEY ARE HOGGING EVERYTHING


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
but just by being afk the whole time and actually on the server lol


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] stacey#1000
They were accused of that before


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] bman#0435
what if theyre both pxrp and roseh


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] bman#0435
üò≥


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] stacey#1000
Omg


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
well they were both managers when roseh was here


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
so thats a lot of dedication


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
lol but roseh didnt even go on the server to fake afk


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
ik she just lied üòÇ


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
she had like a bot


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
THEN GOT SUSPENDED FOR IT AND KEPT DOING IT


[17-Jan-20 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
every hour on the dot


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly yeah they are active but if they ever up for a shift vote I against it. They also bffs with CBs on firestone


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] ethan;#0003
like everyone 30 mins then a 20 minute break


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] emma;#1525
ya i wont vote for them just because harriet loves them which says a lot


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye let them stag there


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Forever


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
If rhey co.e jere.they can leak


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] emma;#1525
there are plenty of people who are "nice" to harriet but she's not obsessed with any of them like she is emily and anna


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] emma;#1525
soooo


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Cause harriet thinks theyre gonna be shift


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] emma;#1525
idk what y'all think that says about what they must be saying to harriet but i get the feeling its not good lol


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that‚Äôs what I think


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
the fact that u and stacey even told them to cut off the cb relationships


[17-Jan-20 09:50 PM] ethan;#0003
can we make a limit on how many things a senior can do in one day


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
and they still havent


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
We cant limit them


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But we can reminde.


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Em


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
To leave some shit


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
They rushing apps for sure


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
For otber


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds like a recipe for disaster.


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think we need to limit it, we just need to tell emily and anna that they need to be aware that other people have requirements done and if they are hogging and not letting others reach their requirements there could be problems


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
if emily is faking then so is anna


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs faking apps


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] ethan;#0003
But it shows emily is logging shifts


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
they are literally 1 or 2 comments away from replicated activity


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] ethan;#0003
ive never seen her at the hotel


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
bc idc if emily and anna do a ton (as long as they're actually doing it correctly) if other seniors aren't trying, but most of them do try


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] ethan;#0003
or not atleast when im online


[17-Jan-20 09:51 PM] emma;#1525
and its just impossible to do stuff


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
because i dont see it on the friends list


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
ever that shes on the hotel


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
ive never seen emily or anna


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
they're both on my friends list and i never see them at the hotel


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
when i log on


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
I NEVER HEARD OF ANNA BEFORE SHE WAS SENIOR


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
except emily is on rn


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
oops


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
I saw her on the senior vote and i never heard of the name before


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
gonna join to see what shes doing


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I like how they say


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
oh its a private serve.r..


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
she just stands there


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
wat-


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
private server-


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
why cant i get on


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
its not a ps


[17-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
it just didn't let me join


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
ok i can get on now


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
that was weird


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
idk what happened


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
ur weird


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
so


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
makes sense


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003
if it was a private server, i was going to say LOL


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003
that is 100% faking


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
Hm so this shift looks legit for emily


[17-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
lots of chatlogs


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
her only logs are viewing people, plus two kicks


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
bruhhh i see x_leak at Venti rn


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
but this at least makes me feel slightly like she's not faking shifts lol


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
i told you he plays roblox everyday


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
doesn't mean i support her for shift


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
just nice to know


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
he just chooses not to go to bloxton


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
leak only goes to build for sessions


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] emma;#1525
ive never seen him go to anything else


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
BRUH SEBBY IS ON VENTI I WANT HIM TO GO TO TRAINING


[17-Jan-20 09:54 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Jan-20 10:11 PM] bman#0435
if i ever "hogged" apps itd be because i miss-counted how many i acc read


[17-Jan-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Jan-20 10:11 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 10:11 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

I had to fight with em daily


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
Being a senior with them with apps was unfair


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Stacey mayb


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
Had to message Emily once when doing apps as senior


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
like now that im an hr


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
they NEVER ask me to host


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
probs 3-4 times


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
And ask how many she had left when she already had 20


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
and thats it


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
but when i was a senior


[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
And I had to wait when I WAS the one who actually needed the 20 apps


[17-Jan-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435
BLISS FEELS ME


[17-Jan-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[17-Jan-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435

[17-Jan-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Then im sad


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Anyways i hate their pairing method


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They playing tag team all day


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
And honestly they still might be faking shifts. Not the entire shift but part of their shifts idk


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
Like just standing there


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
y‚Äôall need to stop letting them co host!!!


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
I let them once and felt bad bc it‚Äôs like cheating lol


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
I try


[17-Jan-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
They don‚Äôt host for me a lot


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
Because if I have more than one senior asking I give second server go other seniors and not them right away


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
they host for me a bit


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They dont for me too cause they know my sessions are hopeless


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
I have to ask people to host half the time lol


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
can stop them from cohosting when they never ask me if they can host


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
üò≥


[17-Jan-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Jan-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
How does he ask


[17-Jan-20 10:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@xAfroTrey how the FUCK does she think saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre copied answers, other people have said them before but I don‚Äôt think they copied since they‚Äôve said it in interviews‚Äù makes ANY sense


[18-Jan-20 10:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

Hello KawiP, 

I am writing this letter today to announce your termination here at Bloxton Hotels, due to leaking content specifically targeted towards members of the Bloxton Staff Team, which is a violation of Bloxton's policies within the group. After some time investigating and observing your actions, you have been terminated from the Bloxton Staff Team. We are saddened that your journey has come to an end, but due to many of the violations listed in this letter, you have been demoted from your position. With that being said, we would like to thank you for your time as a Middle-Rank, and we genuinely hope you can take this opportunity to learn from your mistakes in another group. If you happen to have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to respond to this notice. I will be responding to your reply whenever I am available. Thank you for reading, and good luck on your future endeavors. 


Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

I find this ridiculous because I was not told about the second picture for sure. And you could AT THE FREAKING LEAST pointed it out, thanks. The hotel is/was great, but rules aren't the same as the hotel, toodles. See you maybe never."

god that game and spamming gives me flashbacks


[18-Jan-20 02:16 PM] Polk#1596
i remember when i was a new HR and i had to warn ender for spamming in that game


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Polk#1596
cuz it was a public gamenight or something


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Polk#1596
and he took it horribly and he hated me for it for a long time after


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey dude your announcement on that demotion is so chaotic


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh how


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
‚Äúafter a few minutes of investigating‚Äù


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it really did


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like it was right ahead


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
‚ÄúWe concluded they may have bee suspected of leaking‚Äù


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] bman#0435
how does that make it chaotic


[18-Jan-20 02:17 PM] bman#0435
o


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she was


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Bc saying we only took a minute to investigate is just


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Bad


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Lmao


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Even if it‚Äôs true


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
I wouldn‚Äôt want the HRs to only take 3 minutes to decide to fire me


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
And saying she is suspected of leaking


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
When you know she leaked


[18-Jan-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Is confusing


[18-Jan-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
just notes lmao


[18-Jan-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well uhh


[18-Jan-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
well


[18-Jan-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they found out before i made the announcement


[18-Jan-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
we knew she leaked so the faster she is gone the better before she leaked more


[18-Jan-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
no sense of waiting when we know


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the worst part is


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
its like if someone was abusing and we decided to wait to demote them to investigate


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
many of them knew she was sus asf


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
if they abuse they gone


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not like info wise


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
she acted like we didnt make 100 announcements on leaking and terminations abt leaking


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] katie#0200
bruh


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the way she blew up at me was not cool lol


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] katie#0200
i made is so clear in my promo guide that leaking will result in a termination


[18-Jan-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
saying our rules arent that straight forward


[18-Jan-20 02:21 PM] katie#0200
it*


[18-Jan-20 02:21 PM] bman#0435
like sweetie if u read the announcements and what ur promoter said


[18-Jan-20 02:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i literally shared it to her @katie


[18-Jan-20 02:21 PM] bman#0435

@stacey I didn‚Äôt say we should have waited it‚Äôs just kinda odd to publicize that we took 0 time


[18-Jan-20 02:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
thing is, there was no need lol


[18-Jan-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
Obviously it was a quick fire but I just know that if I was an MR and saw that y‚Äôall only took 2 minutes to look into something i would be scared lmao


[18-Jan-20 02:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
in her own words, she said it was an "mr secret"


[18-Jan-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs all  about appearances


[18-Jan-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Jan-20 02:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hold up


[18-Jan-20 02:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
scared of what exactly


[18-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
saying it basically makes us look like we don‚Äôt look into these cases carefully even though it was clear she leaked, they don‚Äôt know that we got the evidence in a snap of a finger


[18-Jan-20 02:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait how bloo


[18-Jan-20 02:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im confused sorry


[18-Jan-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
shes saying the announcement makes it look like we didnt put in the proper amount of time an investigation should typically have


[18-Jan-20 02:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[18-Jan-20 02:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk man


[18-Jan-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the evidence pretty much spoke for itself


[18-Jan-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like she leaked twice


[18-Jan-20 02:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think adding ‚Äúafter few minutes of investigating‚Äù was unnecessary


[18-Jan-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk if it makes sense to change it now


[18-Jan-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because:


[18-Jan-20 02:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk just leave it, it‚Äôs been up for a while now and most MR‚Äôs probably read it by now


[18-Jan-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
a) they saw it and knew what happened


[18-Jan-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hm ok


[18-Jan-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but idk


[18-Jan-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
having to see her leak in less than an hour is uhh


[18-Jan-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

will someone tell me why imag is trying to get me to come to interviews


[18-Jan-20 02:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

what pisses me off more is when i mod a server and the host goes "u missed (username)" and id rejoin and THAT MR HAD JUST JOINED


[18-Jan-20 02:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435

[18-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596

[18-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435
id mod his server


[18-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435
then leave


[18-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435
and the mr would join


[18-Jan-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435

[18-Jan-20 02:53 PM] bman#0435

ohhhhhhhhh


[18-Jan-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
@bman @ethan; literally just ‚Äúthis hr wants you to kick passers. This HR doesn‚Äôt. This HR assigns offices/naming. This HR doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù


[18-Jan-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
Nothing confidential lol


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] ethan;#0003
i thought it was like


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] ethan;#0003
the entire rules


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] ethan;#0003
and grammar tests


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] bman#0435
we say that stuff in our pms tho


[18-Jan-20 07:46 PM] bman#0435
so i dont see a point


[18-Jan-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs just to make their lives a bit easier


[18-Jan-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
Apparently like 21/24 asked MRs wanted it


[18-Jan-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt see why we wouldn‚Äôt


[18-Jan-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
lol y tf would that even be useful


[18-Jan-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
so if they click off the pm or forget they can reference the doc


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
thats when they can look at logs


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
Logs tag


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
then they can ask us what we said


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
Idk it‚Äôs just something they all wanted


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
So I don‚Äôt see what a negative is


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
logs dont tag every word


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
so


[18-Jan-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
Bman do you see a downside to doing a doc tho


[18-Jan-20 07:49 PM] bman#0435
well hosts may change what they do for that stuff depending on each session


[18-Jan-20 07:49 PM] bman#0435
and i dont see a point in it either way


[18-Jan-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
Not seeing a point isn‚Äôt a downside


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
i never said it was


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
I just think if a lot of MRs want it we should listen


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
Even if we don‚Äôt see a large point to it


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
Clearly they do


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
the mrs want a lot of things


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
but we dont fulfill everything


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
for example, demoting trey


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
.


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
.


[18-Jan-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
.


[18-Jan-20 07:51 PM] emma;#1525
This is such an easy thing to do though


[18-Jan-20 07:55 PM] bman#0435
bruh acelesteq passed 2 people and skipped 2 questions üíÄ


[18-Jan-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
I think we should do it


[18-Jan-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
It is true every hr does stuff differently and people have gotten into trouble for doing something at a session for something the specific host doesn‚Äôt allow but another does


[18-Jan-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
And it is hard to remember how every host does stuff


[18-Jan-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Just to clarify, the doc I mentioned earlier would JUST have things like which HRs want you to kick/not kick passers, if managers figure out who‚Äôs naminf or if the host decides, etc. NO confidential stuff that would hurt us if it was leaked. It wouldn‚Äôt be a ‚Äúthis is the ONLY way the host does it‚Äù thing, just a ‚Äúexpect this to happen with this host but still read PMs fully or you‚Äôll be warned‚Äù @High Rank


[18-Jan-20 07:57 PM] emma;#1525
Oh I tagged high rank twice


[18-Jan-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[18-Jan-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
And specifically for interviews as well


[18-Jan-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
Like which host wants you to teleport them to them, have them line up outside doors, and use pass command and kick them


[18-Jan-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs a big one


[18-Jan-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
People have legit gotten in trouble for not teleporting them to the host because they lined them up outside of doors like other host do


[18-Jan-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt see any reason why we can‚Äôt do this


[18-Jan-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
If you disagree name a legit reason that‚Äôs not leaking this information because it‚Äôs not leaking big information at all


[18-Jan-20 08:00 PM] Polk#1596
do you guys not pm them what to do or something?


[18-Jan-20 08:00 PM] Polk#1596
i find it useless when i pm them the exact instructions to make a doc about it


[18-Jan-20 08:00 PM] Polk#1596
if they forget they can just ask or screenshot the pm


[18-Jan-20 08:01 PM] Polk#1596
like we've never had a problem with this before why is this coming up now


[18-Jan-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
Because pretty much the entire MR team wants it


[18-Jan-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
And I don‚Äôt see a problem with it


[18-Jan-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
If they forget they can easily check it


[18-Jan-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
Idk why the mr team wants it


[18-Jan-20 08:02 PM] Polk#1596
ok but then what is the point of pming them instructions


[18-Jan-20 08:02 PM] Polk#1596
did u guys do a vote or something?


[18-Jan-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; why does the mr team want one


[18-Jan-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
Like did they say why or just ask for it


[18-Jan-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
Idk maybe put a vote in staff announcements to see which MRs really want it


[18-Jan-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
LOL he playing it off as if i didnt even see

him


[18-Jan-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey idk Slee asked them all and said like 21/24 said they wanted it


[18-Jan-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe make a form or something so MRs can list a reason why they want it and have them vote


[18-Jan-20 08:07 PM] Polk#1596
slee asked me it in dms


[18-Jan-20 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
So we can see for real if majority want it. If majority does want it fr then we should respect their wishes and make things easier for them it‚Äôs not hard to make a simple doc


[18-Jan-20 08:07 PM] Polk#1596
i said no because we dont need a document for just three different things


[18-Jan-20 08:07 PM] Polk#1596
like it isnt that complicated


[18-Jan-20 08:08 PM] Polk#1596
but yeah if the majority wants it then i guess


[18-Jan-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
If they don‚Äôt tell us real reasons why they want it then there is no point


[18-Jan-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
Just make a form and put a vote up for MRs @emma;


[18-Jan-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
I want to see their reasons why they want one


[18-Jan-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
They want it because it‚Äôs hard to remember what you‚Äôre told at 30 different sessions and yes we do have PMs and chatlogs but if someone could know the expectations BEFORE a social and have it as a reference it would make their lives easier


[18-Jan-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm not dead set on doing it, Slee is just really passionate about it and the fact a lot of MRs want it means a lot to me


[18-Jan-20 08:10 PM] bman#0435
im out here exposinnnnnnnnnnnn

[18-Jan-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying, whatever thing he made to have MRs vote guaranteed not every single MR saw it so we don‚Äôt know for sure how many actually want it. There is a lot more then 24 MRs.


[18-Jan-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
So before we decide we need to have a real vote ALL MRs can see and have. Form so they can list why. If majority wants it then im all for it.

[19-Jan-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hello,

Unfortunately, you are permitted with no appeals regarding Bloxton Hotels. In the span of one single month, you were swearing in the Dshjcord server, being quite disrespectful to a Shift Manager, and bypassing at the hotel. With that amount of time, that's a lot of weight on your shoulders for someone trying to appeal. And due to the reasons that I have listed, you are unable to obtain a staff role. I have more than enough evidence regarding the offenses you have committed. With that said, thank you for contacting me. And I am saddened to come to this conclusion regarding your account history.

Best Regards,

xAfroTrey

[19-Jan-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
didn't his test get ripped up after passing


[19-Jan-20 05:46 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Idk LOL


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
so


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
megan has forgotten to log her sessions


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
again


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
shes done like a good handful of trainings this week


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
and only commented 1 thing


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
so i spoke with her


[19-Jan-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
again


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
and reminder her


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
again


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
so


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
she legit like if she does it again where i remind her 1 more time


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
she needs a warning or like suspension


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
she keeps forgetting to do all her stuff as senior


[19-Jan-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
shes even forgotten to send passers a couple times


[19-Jan-20 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn what do you think


[19-Jan-20 06:02 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i think a suspensions too much, its not like shes been senior for months, she only recently got promoted so its still new to her


[19-Jan-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[19-Jan-20 06:02 PM] stacey#1000
she got promoted in october


[19-Jan-20 06:02 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i mean to senior


[19-Jan-20 06:02 PM] stacey#1000
its been like 3 months, ive reminder her to log stuff about 5 times or more


[19-Jan-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
so  she needs a verbal warning if she does it again


[19-Jan-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
and if it still continues then a suspension


[19-Jan-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
legit I shouldnt have to remind her every single time


[19-Jan-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
and thats what it is


[19-Jan-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
aside from the promotion date, i don't think a suspension is necessary for now


[19-Jan-20 06:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not yet at least


[19-Jan-20 06:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh yeah i forgot the old checklists got archived


[19-Jan-20 06:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think she does it on purpose, that's the hard part


[19-Jan-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
she doesnt but


[19-Jan-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
still she shouldnt be forgetting every single time


[19-Jan-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
i feel like im babying her always having to remind her


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
im the only one that does


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
she needs a verbal warning


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do you need for me to help you out


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
i spoke with her today


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
about why her card had 1 comment when shes done many sessions after


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
and I told her to log all her sessions shes done


[19-Jan-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
and told her to stop forgetting


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
its just im so close with her  i shouldnt be the one giving her the warning


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
i can tho


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
she needs a proper


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
letter warning


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
to get the point


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Being close to someone doesnt matter


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

Ugh


[19-Jan-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she did fine with my passers for today


[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
she didnt log it


[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
on her card


[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Maybe she stress abt school


[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
she never does


[19-Jan-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
unless i tell her to


[19-Jan-20 06:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Then warn


[19-Jan-20 06:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Shes been in the position long alr


[19-Jan-20 06:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But theres like doqee or drew doing better


[19-Jan-20 06:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Anyways ask her for the reason she forgot


[19-Jan-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's a little too soon to say that mack


[19-Jan-20 06:14 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Later she might say its false warn cause shes too tired


[19-Jan-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they just got promoted but they're having good habits


[19-Jan-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i liked how drew apologized for hogging apps


[19-Jan-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's a very good sign


[19-Jan-20 06:14 PM] bman#0435
he didnt even hog tho


[19-Jan-20 06:15 PM] bman#0435
:flushedbella:


[19-Jan-20 06:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
He even apologised in the senior lounge


[19-Jan-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
true but that's a very good start


[19-Jan-20 06:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Not in dms


[19-Jan-20 06:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[19-Jan-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Jan-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Jan-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank One of our senior managements, Meganqyx has been forgetting to do some of the simple senior management requirements such as logging sessions, shifts, and applications on her senior card. She has also forgotten to send in passers a couple of times. I have reminder her quite a few times now to make it a habit to log a session or shift as soon as she has completed the session/and or shift. She still fails to log her activity as this past week she has done quite a few sessions and yet there was only 1 comment on her card, until I reminder her yet again to log her stuff after questioning her why there was only 1 comment on her card. She usually appears to take this as a joke to me having to remind her countless times to remember to log stuff, as she has said "I'm a bad senior management," and then laughs that she forgot, yet again.  I shouldn't be having to remind her AT ALL to do her senior management duties. Yes, I understand it's normal for people to forget stuff sometimes, but she is forgetting ALL the time to log stuff. She has also forgotten to create a passing card a couple times to post passers for us, having to be reminded of that as well. She doesn't forget that as often. I believe a proper verbal warning will get the point across to stop forgetting simple things and if she keeps forgetting, a possible suspension. Vote: Verbal warning given at this time?

[19-Jan-20 06:29 PM] bman#0435
considering u even have to remind her, that should be a verbal warning


[19-Jan-20 06:29 PM] ethan;#0003

[19-Jan-20 06:29 PM] stacey#1000

but she wont take it seriously


[19-Jan-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000

She‚Äôs being careless not to log stuff

[19-Jan-20 06:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Does she like


[19-Jan-20 06:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Log her stuff late


[19-Jan-20 06:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 06:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Hm


[19-Jan-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
and i ask her why she only has 1 comment on her card when shes done many sessions


[19-Jan-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
so she logged a couple things she could remember late


[19-Jan-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
but its not all there


[19-Jan-20 06:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Well


[19-Jan-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 06:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
It might seem like a bitch move, but what if we just don‚Äôt have her complete her checklist then


[19-Jan-20 06:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
If she doesn‚Äôt log it, not our faults


[19-Jan-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
she never completes her checklist


[19-Jan-20 06:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

Hm


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
well


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
she was active as manager


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
and was manager for a long time


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But now


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
at the beginning of her senior management career it wasnt this bad


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
but after 3 months shes still forgetting


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Sorry im a bad senior manager


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So written warning


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Smh


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
at the start when she forgot i thought it was because she was new


[19-Jan-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
and it was okay


[19-Jan-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
mack


[19-Jan-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
ur a shift


[19-Jan-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
but shes still doing it now


[19-Jan-20 06:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I hate ppl who undermine themselves


[19-Jan-20 06:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Anyways wirtten woooooo


[19-Jan-20 06:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ok i gotta zoom to school


[19-Jan-20 06:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Okay well if she can‚Äôt do her senior job, another bitchy move but if she can‚Äôt even remember to write down passers she shouldn‚Äôt even be a senior management. After many verbal warnings by u and if after this written warning she STILL can‚Äôt log her stuff or give passers on time we might need to rethink this senior thing, she clearly isn‚Äôt ready but that‚Äôs only if she does it after this warning


[19-Jan-20 06:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Verbal reminders *


[19-Jan-20 06:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
not warnings


[19-Jan-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
she hasnt been forgetting to send passers as often, shes just done it a couple times. its mainly forgetting to log stuff which is legit the easiest thing she shouldnt be forgetting


[19-Jan-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
and yes if she still does this stuff


[19-Jan-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
after a proper warning


[19-Jan-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
it should be a suspension


[19-Jan-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
then if it continues still


[19-Jan-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
go from there


[19-Jan-20 06:54 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ok

Hello Meganqyx,

I am writing this letter today to remind you that you have obtained a written warning due to lack of consistency with logging shifts, sessions, applications, and much more on your card for the Senior Management Board. In addition to that, we have also took notice on you forgetting to send in passers a few times on the T&I Passers and Attendance list inside the card description. With that said, we would like to request for you to resolve this issue as soon as possible, given that you have been a Senior Management since October 29th.  With that in mind, do not receive this as anything intimidating or threatening, as this a reminder to improve your mistake as an MR. Any repetition of this action may lead to another letter in your messages on Discord. If you happen to have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to respond to this notice. I will respond within less than a day or whenever I am not so occupied of my typical routine. Thank you for reading, and have a good rest of your day.

Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

[19-Jan-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
From her not accepting their friend request

[19-Jan-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
Just because that‚Äôs her status doesn‚Äôt mean we have to wait for a ‚Äúgood time‚Äù to message her. We can message at anytime.


[19-Jan-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
She legit forgot to put passers again and I didn‚Äôt notice because I didn‚Äôt look at the card


[19-Jan-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm not ranking rn


[19-Jan-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
If she‚Äôs really upset why is she even online rn if she just going to bed upset with everyone

Ah, I'm sorry about that. However, we're still prompted to message you anytime in instances like these.


[19-Jan-20 08:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 08:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i like megan


[19-Jan-20 08:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
we used to joke around


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but now


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i feel like i cant joke around anymore


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
:/


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm good friends with her but it doesn‚Äôt change that she can‚Äôt act out and expect us to give her special treatment when it comes to her rank


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
mhm


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I brought this up


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
She usually acts out in stuff


[19-Jan-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
Like she is rn


[19-Jan-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
She probably is like debating resigning now like she‚Äôs done before when she gets upset


[19-Jan-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
‚ÄúBruh I‚Äôm done with hosting.‚Äù


[19-Jan-20 08:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 08:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
her saying shes done hosting


[19-Jan-20 08:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
is not the way to go


[19-Jan-20 08:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she should put a reminder in her guide


[19-Jan-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Megan_MustacheToday at 9:02 PM
Then why didn't you do it earlier? I know it's been an issue for a little while now and I'm trying to fix it.


[19-Jan-20 08:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
tf why cant she just accept it


[19-Jan-20 08:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she giving u attitude over a serious thing lol


[19-Jan-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here's how I'm going to respond:


[19-Jan-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
Omg she can‚Äôt seriously expect us to read her mind when she‚Äôs not upset and message her then


[19-Jan-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs not how stuff works


[19-Jan-20 08:04 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
She sent me passers after trey sent the letter


[19-Jan-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
See she forgot to log


[19-Jan-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
And then asks who she hosted for


[19-Jan-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
Because I told her to log her stuff

[19-Jan-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
Its unprofessional smh. If she was really that upset she could‚Äôve chose to not reply right away until she was in a better mood


[19-Jan-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
And if she is upset....why is she even online and taking it out on others by changing her status


[19-Jan-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
Omg her new status is a rolling eye emoji wtf


[19-Jan-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
She is not taking this professional at all


[19-Jan-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Megan, I wasn't really aware on it until the issue was brought into my attention. And once I took a look for it myself, that led me to send over the warning. Now that I've sent you the warning and you talked about fixing it, now would be a good time to actually fix the problem. It's time to be more consistent with your Senior Management duties, see where I'm going with this?


[19-Jan-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
Is that what you sent her


[19-Jan-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
Or are going to send her


[19-Jan-20 08:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
going to send her


[19-Jan-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
Change the one sentence


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

to the maxxxxxx


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i told her


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
that


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
To: Megan, I wasn‚Äôt really aware of this issue until it was brought to my attention where I further looked into it to notice it myself.


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she should go offline adn relax


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
in sl


[19-Jan-20 08:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If Megan isn‚Äôt gonna remember anything she does then she isn‚Äôt worthy to be senior. being senior is a big responsibility and this has been going on with her for multiple occasions.


[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@Bloo_Berriez exactly what i said üôÑ im so mad


[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
She might honestly need a suspension for her attitude rn


[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she just gave me attitude for fucking trying to help


[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
like


[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok


[19-Jan-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
This is why we sent warning


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fixed the sentence @stacey


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Scroll up


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
To get a start that this is serious and she needs to fix it and if she continues with forgetting everything she is not ready for senior


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if Megan can‚Äôt handle herself and be mature about this instead of screaming at everyone then.. üòê


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
right Stacey


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
im lowkey kinda mad


[19-Jan-20 08:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
she‚Äôs clearly showing us that she can‚Äôt handle being senior


[19-Jan-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Are you ok with it now


[19-Jan-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
I get she was already upset from something else but it doesn‚Äôt give her the right to expect us to ‚Äúwait for the right time‚Äù to message her and then lash out at HRs.

[19-Jan-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
If she‚Äôs upset


[19-Jan-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs called go offline and not look at discord


[19-Jan-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
Im so annoyed with her rn


[19-Jan-20 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
I wonder if she‚Äôs gonna unfriend everyone again and leave every single discord server she was in

[19-Jan-20 08:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like how she's reacting like those "don't hmu" people


[19-Jan-20 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
So something made her upset, not something from Bloxton. But she left every single discord server she as in and unfriended everyone on discord so not even myself could message  her so she like blocked me. Then she comes back the next day saying sorry and that she screwed up. Something little makes her upset and she always reacts this way


[19-Jan-20 08:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
alright she provided an acceptable response

But I'm not sure if I like what she's doing.


[19-Jan-20 08:19 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs still not acting professional


[19-Jan-20 08:19 PM] stacey#1000
Lowkey she knows I brought it up most likely and that‚Äôs why she got warned. She‚Äôs going to act all mad at me now


[19-Jan-20 08:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll say a simple "Thank you." but that was not a good way to handle her problems.


[19-Jan-20 08:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It feels like she's running away from them.


[19-Jan-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs not facing that she made a mistake professional at al


[19-Jan-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
All*


[19-Jan-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
And she can‚Äôt expect me to not bring this up when I‚Äôve been reminding her so many times. Has to be done idc how close of a friend she is to me she has to take her rank seriously


[19-Jan-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
Hey, I was just told about the stuff that happened earlier. I hope everything is going okay for you, but you need to talk things out with Stacey and Trey. Unfriending them was pretty immature (I realize it wasn't a good time for them to be DMing you but plenty of people have "No DMs" statuses that typically just mean a regular DND so they didn't realize it was actually a bad time) and overall I think the situation could have been handled better. You do have certain responsibilities, and no one expects you to be perfect, but Trey and Stacey are just trying to help you avoid getting into bigger trouble and you shouldn't be unfriending them over that.


[19-Jan-20 09:07 PM] stacey#1000
EMMA

[19-Jan-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
its broken


[19-Jan-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
i told megan this:


[19-Jan-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
"I understand you are upset, which is why it's best to calm yourself down."


[19-Jan-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think she's upset at me the most


[19-Jan-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
now she is asking me why shes being attacked


[19-Jan-20 09:11 PM] emma;#1525
Megan is saying she didn't block anyone...?


[19-Jan-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
she unfriended me


[19-Jan-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
and trey


[19-Jan-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
on discord


[19-Jan-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
i got a friend request to prove it

üôÑ


[19-Jan-20 09:11 PM] emma;#1525
i get she's agitated rn but this is really not how you handle a situation


[19-Jan-20 09:12 PM] emma;#1525
why is she on discord if she's so agitated anyways


[19-Jan-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
exactly


[19-Jan-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Jan-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
omg send


[19-Jan-20 09:14 PM] emma;#1525
you should just accept it


[19-Jan-20 09:14 PM] emma;#1525
im telling her to talk it out with you and trey


[19-Jan-20 09:15 PM] emma;#1525
bc its not your fault if she was agitated


[19-Jan-20 09:15 PM] emma;#1525
and didnt tell you why


[19-Jan-20 09:15 PM] emma;#1525
and just took her anger out on you


[19-Jan-20 09:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, she definitely took it out on me. And like you said before, she should have been off Discord.


[19-Jan-20 09:16 PM] emma;#1525
she's stopped responding to me now lol


[19-Jan-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
she wants to vc with me


[19-Jan-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
ill talk to her


[19-Jan-20 09:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And real talk, it's a big red flag when she does that "DND" thing.


[19-Jan-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
ill mention it to her


[19-Jan-20 09:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok.


[19-Jan-20 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
leaving it up to her if she wants to vc


[19-Jan-20 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
she just didnt take this professional at all


[19-Jan-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
i mean if she wants to go on dnd that's her own prerogative, she just cant expect everyone to know that shes upset or mad or not in the mood to talk


[19-Jan-20 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
first thing she says is "bruh im done with hosting"


[19-Jan-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
are you deadass


[19-Jan-20 09:20 PM] stacey#1000
ok maybe she doesnt want to vc


[19-Jan-20 09:20 PM] stacey#1000
oh well

I'm sorry I was angry and I blew up. I didn't mean to be aggressive like I said before and I keep saying until you understand. I closed my DMs and unfriended most the of the people. There's nothing more I can say. I messed up.


[19-Jan-20 09:37 PM] emma;#1525
she sent the exact same thing to me


[19-Jan-20 09:37 PM] emma;#1525

does she have memory loss

because if she does itd be more understandable


[19-Jan-20 09:43 PM] bman#0435

You can promise to not let yourself react like this in the future, like it was only a warning and it made you unfriend all the HRs and close dms and that's just annoying as your friend bc I wouldn't let anyone else act like that without further consequences which I feel like you know but I really don't want to have to talk to you like you're one of those MRs who's still learning how to communicate their issues. It just makes me worried that I can't treat you as I do other MRs because it makes us feel like you're just going to get mad at us for doing our jobs

[19-Jan-20 09:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we cant have a senior behaving like this


[19-Jan-20 09:55 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i would love to but i dont think we can rly


[19-Jan-20 09:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
that'd be a weird announcement to make tho :flusterdoggu:


[19-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm tempted to message her about the apology


[19-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
shes forgetting all these senior responsibilities as well as acting immaturely and disrespectfully


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like i don't know if i should accept just yet


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
y she gotta block us tho


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435

[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the fact that she‚Äôs a senior and she did that


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
what i would do is run them over in stapleton


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
and feel better


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
i ran over harriet


[19-Jan-20 09:56 PM] bman#0435
and felt 10x better


[19-Jan-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The only time you should really block users is if they're causing you problems.


[19-Jan-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
so lets block megan since shes causing problems to the hr team XDDDDD

[19-Jan-20 09:57 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525

[19-Jan-20 09:57 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 09:58 PM] bman#0435

[19-Jan-20 09:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm worried about her anger management.


[19-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
it isn't an excuse at this point


[19-Jan-20 09:58 PM] bman#0435
skirts should be the least of her priorities


[19-Jan-20 09:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i mean we all have a bit of anxiety


[19-Jan-20 09:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
she isn't a little kied


[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
this shit aint gonna fly anywhere


[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] bman#0435
like megan might have anxiety and such but if its that bad then she should be taking meds for that


[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
she's gonna be overwhelmed in school


[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
she's gonna be overwhelmed at work


[19-Jan-20 09:59 PM] bman#0435

**Behavior in Staff Lounge.**

MR team,

Staff lounge has always been a place for you guys to be able to talk to your fellow MRs in a more relaxed environment then in general discussion. One of the rules we have is that you are allowed to curse, however this rule recently has become a bit too... interpreted.

We've noticed a lot of people cursing at other MRs in staff lounge, using an excessive amount of foul language, being rude (even as a joke), or just in general being too aggressive.

We want to remind you guys that staff lounge is supposed to be a fun place, not a place where people have to worry about being targeted. While cursing is still definitely allowed, please be mindful of how you use it. The rule is that cursing is allowed as long as it is *respectful*. If we feel that people are still being wayyyy too aggressive with cursing and not respecting each other (and saying "it's just a joke" isn't an excuse that we'll accept) then we'll have to revisit that rule.

Again, cursing is still allowed but just make sure that you aren't aiming it at anyone. We want to make sure everyone feels respected.

Hi, before this video begins, I‚Äôd like to just inform you all that this is not the normal content  that I usually tend to make. Yeah no shit you big fucking cunt you make fucking robeats videos what why the fuck are you talking about Bloxton Hotels? Or Hilton Hotels as most people know it as. Well because for  some reason some friends have really pushed me over the fucking edge with this group, I‚Äôve been dealing with this bullshit for almost the past two years now. And it‚Äôs kind of fucking ridiculous at this point. So I believe that I have to make this video as a statement with my experience with this fucking bullshit group.

[20-Jan-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
if I make players not collide with each other in Bloxton it will resolve all flinging exploits. The question is should I take this measure or should Is it important that players collide.


[20-Jan-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
I might have to find another alternative if you guys don't like this solution


[20-Jan-20 03:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wdym by collide


[20-Jan-20 03:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like bump players?? @Beartikal


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
like walk through players


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
Could fix fling exploits


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
all of em


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
but I don't know if it's important that players collide


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
because of receptionist lines, etc


[20-Jan-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
what u think


[20-Jan-20 03:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i like that actually


[20-Jan-20 03:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh u think so


[20-Jan-20 03:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
bloxxed hotels had the same issue but it was all resolved by non collide playrrs


[20-Jan-20 03:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i get annoyed with the bumping sometimes


[20-Jan-20 03:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
and then the plate exploit can be fixed with some lines of code I have in mind


[20-Jan-20 03:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
I'll get started on it today


[20-Jan-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Hello VACR0N, 

I am writing this letter today to announce your suspension here at Bloxton Hotels, due to horseplaying around at the Training Center and being immature, which is a violation of Bloxton's policies within the group. The High-Rank Team has received many screenshots of you fooling around at the beginning of the session, along with you dancing on a table with a bikini outfit. Given that you are apart of the Management Team, we do require members such as yourself to a higher standard amongst your position. In addition to that, we do expect the better of you instead of what you have shown during this incident. With that being said, we are hopeful that you do not sustain this type of action in the future. If you happen to have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to respond to this notice. I will be responding to your reply whenever I am available. You will be suspended from your position until 1/23/2020, at 4:48 PM EST. Thank you for reading for this notice, and we wish you the best of luck of your road to improvement after this suspension.

Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

or y it would change


[20-Jan-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435

[20-Jan-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can't really assume that yet.


[20-Jan-20 04:14 PM] bman#0435

I guess, but he received 9 votes during his promotion to Management. I'd closely monitor him to see how he treats his rank.

[20-Jan-20 04:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and


[20-Jan-20 04:40 PM] emma;#1525
It looked like she was making fun of bliss‚Äôs pfp too


[20-Jan-20 04:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she‚Äôs just way out of line


[20-Jan-20 04:41 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she was so rude to BLUSS


[20-Jan-20 04:41 PM] emma;#1525

[20-Jan-20 04:41 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Bliss


[20-Jan-20 04:41 PM] emma;#1525
She needs a suspension then


[20-Jan-20 04:41 PM] emma;#1525

[20-Jan-20 04:42 PM] emma;#1525

[20-Jan-20 04:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She literally asked Iced to exploit and threatened someone.


[20-Jan-20 04:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
well emma


[20-Jan-20 04:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

"can you get her to exploit"


[20-Jan-20 04:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

has she ever been suspended for this


[20-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
because if it keeps continuing she may need a suspension


[20-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 04:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I still think she needs to have disciplinary action, to be fairly honest.


[20-Jan-20 04:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know about you guys, but I feel like something needs to happen with her. Her asking Iced to do something that harms the hotel is a big red flag.

@Bloo_Berriez Basically she gets pissed at me for no reason and she doesn't respect my feelings at all but expects me to respect gets and she walks all over me like a doormat


[20-Jan-20 05:18 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Tbh at this point it's cyberbullying lmao since she shades me in staff lounge


[20-Jan-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bruh im sorry she has to do this during ur surgery


[20-Jan-20 05:18 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I'm just over it


[20-Jan-20 05:18 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She literally tagged me right after my surgery and shades me


[20-Jan-20 05:18 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I'm in so much pain and then I cried and it made my stomach feel so much worse


[20-Jan-20 05:19 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I just tried so hard to make the friendship work and I gave her so many chances but it's not enough for her


[20-Jan-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i still think she should've been suspended but it is what it is


[20-Jan-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that shit she wanted iced to do was NOT cool


[20-Jan-20 05:19 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
@emma; She just likes to shade me a lot even though she still tries to be my friend so I blocked her :/


[20-Jan-20 05:19 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I agree


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
she is not a true friend at all


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
That stuff with iced was not professional either


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
and yes she shouldve been suspended


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I know she's pretty toxic tbh


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
and still should me


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I cry over her too much


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
be*


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Should I make a vote?


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
she really should be suspended rn....


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
damn i might have to run through a vot-


[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well, I've suspended Vac, so I'll guess I'll do it for here today as well.


[20-Jan-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like


[20-Jan-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
she will act worse and all shaded and be like a toxic former

Ikr


[20-Jan-20 05:23 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Ik she's gonna be that toxic former since she's already toxic but concealing it


[20-Jan-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
like is this how she responds all the time to situations she cant be serious at all when she needs to


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Ikr


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
she acts like she needs all the attention and shes the victim


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She has the same problem as Megan.


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
kinda how megan is acting rn too a bit, not that bad tho


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
but still


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
then we cant fire her if we arent firing megan


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
we cant even suspend her if you're saying shes not as bad as megan


[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
bc we didnt do anything to megan

[20-Jan-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
well


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
i think megan needs a suspension too for her behaviour...


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
for how she reacted


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Same


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
megan doesnt do this like addie


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Between the two, I think Addie is worse.


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
u cant compare her fully to addie


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
they both different but similar too


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
idek how to explain it


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Addie has just ruined me


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
addie's is definitely more what i would classify as "cyberbullying" since it is very targetted


[20-Jan-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
megan is just immaturity aimed at multiple people


[20-Jan-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
still not good


[20-Jan-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
but i'd say addie's is more evil


[20-Jan-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I agree.


[20-Jan-20 05:26 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She really likes to shade me and I hate it when all I do is try to be there for her


[20-Jan-20 05:26 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
But it's hard when she treats me like shit


[20-Jan-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
megan is not like cyberbullying and saying stuff like addie but addie is like fully saying things to be cyberfulling, megan is just acting immature and ccant take criticism, when she needs to learn to mature a bit


[20-Jan-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
so I vote


[20-Jan-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
demotion for addie


[20-Jan-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
suspension for megan

[20-Jan-20 05:28 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Honestly I'd be fine with a demotion too


[20-Jan-20 05:28 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She hurts too many people and she isn't good for our community


[20-Jan-20 05:28 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She hurt holly, she hurt me, and god knows who else

Holly has told me she doesn't know what to do anymore


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
not to be that person but *technically* i told megan she wouldnt be suspended last night... might have been wrong of me but no one was mentioning suspending her last night so i didnt think it was what y'all wanted to do lol


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
I mentioned it!!!


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525

[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
yes i did


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
i mean we still *can* suspend


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
her


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
i would feel bad


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
but like


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Should we make a vote for both on what consequences should be done?


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
obvs its not just up to me lol


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
i mentioned cant we suspend her for this behaviour


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
if she gets suspended


[20-Jan-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
she will most likely resign


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
but idc


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
we mentioned suspending many times lol


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
we talked about


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
stacey mentioned it the most


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
especially in the vc


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
if she still continued to fail to remember to do stuff as senior after a warning


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
then a suspension


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
but then i also mentioned


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
she just got warned yesterday


[20-Jan-20 05:30 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
@xAfroTrey U wanna make a vote for what consequences addie should get?

Yes.


[20-Jan-20 05:31 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Alr


[20-Jan-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
that for the way she is reacting is not great and that she could get suspended alone for that


[20-Jan-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[20-Jan-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
fire addie


[20-Jan-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[20-Jan-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
still between suspension and demotion


[20-Jan-20 05:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright, but you have to pick one over the other though. @stacey


[20-Jan-20 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
ik


[20-Jan-20 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
just do a vote thing


[20-Jan-20 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
then ill decide


[20-Jan-20 05:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll still writing the ping. I know we've gotten a lot today, but I'm still going to do it.

It's really sad how addie just keeps getting worse


[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@High Rank Well, now that we've learned what Addie has done thus far, it's quite clear the she will require some disciplinary action at this time. That being said, let's run through a voting. üî¥ - Suspension (3 days.) ‚ö´ - Firing. ‚ùî - Other.

{Reactions}
üî¥ ‚ö´ ‚ùî (6) 

[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] bman#0435
y tf would it be a 3 day suspension


[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
wait what did i miss


[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] bman#0435
5 day suspension


[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
is other demotion


[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525
trey tf


[20-Jan-20 05:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's basically the minimum, but if you'd like to do more, then great.


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
longer suspension


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
just say "suspension" and we'll decide on time later


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] bman#0435
5 days


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
if that wins


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
idk yet so ill vote when i decide


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

What is your method for right now, guys?


[20-Jan-20 05:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fair enough. @stacey


[20-Jan-20 05:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd like to hear from the others based on what we know.

Has she been suspended before?


[20-Jan-20 05:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
As far as I've seen she just keeps getting worse


[20-Jan-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
For stuff related to this?


[20-Jan-20 05:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, I don't believe she was suspended.


[20-Jan-20 05:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She's probably gonna blame me for her being suspended lol

[20-Jan-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
If she's never been suspended then she deserves a chance to learn from this.

Not our problem she tends to act this way, now the consequences are catching up to her.

i noticed megan was forgetting to do simple things a lot as her duties as senior, such as logging her sessions and shifts on her card, and even forgetting a few times to post passers for us to rank. Ive reminded her many times to remember to log her stuff, but yet she still failed to remember. So this past week shes done a lot of sessions right, and I noticed she had only 1 comment on her card and I spoke with her again, reminding her again, so I added a vote for a warning that she needs to remember to do her stuff as senior and trey sent her a warning. She didnt react to that well and mature AT ALL. She chose to basically say the HR team is attacking her and thats how she felt about it, and changed her discord status a few times to like "DONT DM ME" and crap, so she blew up at trey for DMing her that warning at a time her status said "DONT DM ME, MAD' or something like that and then unfriended myself, trey, and other HRs and only HRs. She is just overall being very immature and unprofessional in how she responds to criticism, playing the victim when ITS JUST A SIMPLE WARNING TO REMIND HER ABOUT SOMETHING. So yeah trey can add on, her behaviour is jsut real concerning rn as her positiion as senior management. @xM_inn


[20-Jan-20 05:47 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She's Senior, she needs to remember to log her sessions and remember to send passers

MegatronYesterday at 10:33 PM
Listen, I'm sorry that I overreacted and I'm a dumb immature little child who didn't situation as professional ad you guys wanted me to but I tried my hardest and that's all I can try.
Go ahead and share what I said to the whole HR team, I just apologized and there's nothing more I can do. I explained my point of view and I explained that I was already agitated but I TOLD TREY I didn't mean to be aggressive, I needed to cool down and that was the best way possible to me at the current moment.


[20-Jan-20 05:48 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She's being shady too?


[20-Jan-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it's more than likely she realized she fucked up.


[20-Jan-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She didn't even tell me around that time..


[20-Jan-20 05:49 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
She didn't need to take her anger out in any Bloxton related area...

Look, compare the two times between her message and mine.


[20-Jan-20 05:49 PM] stacey#1000
I went on a vc with her to explain to her how the way she handled the situation wasnt professional right

Megan_MustacheYesterday at 10:36 PM
I'm sorry I was angry and I blew up. I didn't mean to be aggressive like I said before and I keep saying until you understand. I closed my DMs and unfriended most the of the people. There's nothing more I can say. I messed up.


[20-Jan-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[20-Jan-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
I told her if she was mad and didnt want to talk to anyone why not just close discord


[20-Jan-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
and she says


[20-Jan-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
"I cant help it but be on discord, okay? I dont know any other way to deal with it, so I unfriended you so you wouldnt message me."


[20-Jan-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This is going to seem like a weird analogy, but.


[20-Jan-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
Legit, every single time Megan gets upset over something, THIS is how she reacts, not mature at all.


[20-Jan-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd say her trying to log off Discord is similar to her dealing with a rash.


[20-Jan-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's tempting to scratch, but doing it worsens the problem.

[20-Jan-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
OH UR NOT EXPLOITING


[20-Jan-20 06:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
Okay so is she still being awkward about it? @stacey


[20-Jan-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
MIN FLINGED U LOL


[20-Jan-20 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
well


[20-Jan-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
she has kinda just got quiet now, not responding to me, but she blew up last night and anytime anything happens that makes her upset she reacts like this which is concerning


[20-Jan-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
here is another example


[20-Jan-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
something not bloxton related made her upset she left every single discord server and unfriended everyone on discord so no one could message her, then she comes back the next day refriending everyone and apologizing


[20-Jan-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
she is never mature in situations like this


[20-Jan-20 06:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
So she has a big problem in acknowledging when she's doing something wrong and starts to attack the opposing person?


[20-Jan-20 06:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
or anyone really*


[20-Jan-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
this is the first time shes ever gotten a warning or anything I believe from bloxton


[20-Jan-20 06:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
wasn't there an issue with her at a themed session once


[20-Jan-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
basically yes, shes known for like blocking people, not talking to them, then coming back and apologizing.


[20-Jan-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
alex, one of our managers


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
has told me megan has blocked her a couple times when shes gotten upset


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
wow


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
she doesnt act mature at all


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
in any situation like this


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
well if she does anything like this again then it's a suspension


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
she just got a warning, that was all


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
what's ur personal opinion on the matter?


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok i suspended addie just now


[20-Jan-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
myself, disappointed in her behaviour because i addressed this behaviour with her before


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
when she left every discord server


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
and unfriended everyone


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Who are u talking about


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
I addressed not the best way to handle the situation


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000

Addie was just really abusive towards him.


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
And what happened with Addie-


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She was suspended.


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
Wait, Addie did something to Bliss?


[20-Jan-20 06:28 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

I just cant stop thinking


[20-Jan-20 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
Do you guys think Megan needs a suspension right now? I am in between yes and no again. This is her first warning for Bloxton yes, but shes always acted immature in situations when something makes her upset, thats not new,


[20-Jan-20 06:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
What did she do/say?


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You do not need to think about this, you are **not** in the wrong for this, Bliss. @¬¢. ·É¶


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
@xAfroTrey Would you mind showing Min the proof?


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Idk Stacey did she do anything else


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What she did was her own fault, and it was inexcusable.


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
It was hard but


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I knew I had to report her


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sure, I'd love to.


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] bman#0435
i think megan could use a suspension ngl


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Addie got what was coming to her


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm gonna clear the training board rq so ping me once you've got all the evidence together


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Yeah ):


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Megan hasn't done anything today, shes just gone silent and not talking to me.


[20-Jan-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Interesting.

MeganToday at 9:20 PM
Stacey,

    I want to start this off by apologizing for being so frustrated and immature with a simple situation. It was wrong of me and I didn‚Äôt mean for it to escalate the way it did. In the moment I didn't realize how immature I was being but then I took a step back today and I realized that I was completely in the wrong. I shouldn't have let it become so personal because I knew you weren't trying to hurt me but I was just so frustrated that I just didn't see that at the time. I‚Äôd also like to apologize for making it come off so personal because all I really meant to do was make it a cool-down for myself to get away so I didn't overreact the way I did. I didn‚Äôt just log off of discord because I talk to my real life friends on here as well as my online. It‚Äôs also hard for me to walk away from Discord because it‚Äôs the only human interaction I get when I‚Äôm at home. Well, now it‚Äôs too late for that but just know it was never my intention to make you feel hurt. I‚Äôd still like to be able to play games and talk all the time because you are my best friend and it saddens me to know I hurt you. I was very immature and I created a huge dramatic situation out of nothing like for the millionth time because I don‚Äôt know how to stop myself and I‚Äôm starting to rant at this point. AHEM. Back to serious talk. In all seriousness, I‚Äôm very sorry and from here on out I promise to handle situations better and not involve you when it‚Äôs really not needed.

      - Megan

[20-Jan-20 11:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, and she admitted in her own words that she agreed it was inappropriate.


[20-Jan-20 11:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I am unsure of why she's trying to weasel her way out of this.


[20-Jan-20 11:00 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
that wasn't apart of the report tho was it?

Listen, she got in trouble for about 3 things here.


[20-Jan-20 11:01 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I saw the exploiter incident and then the harassment


[20-Jan-20 11:01 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[20-Jan-20 11:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Her comment about Iced, her verbal abuse with you, and that comment.

[20-Jan-20 11:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Right, that's exactly what I said to her.


[20-Jan-20 11:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So throughout our investigation, we have received some screenshots of you persecuting Bliss a few times. It was a few months apart up to now, so we decided to look. We have seen many messages of you being quite disrespectful, you changing your status a few times in connection to the situation, etc. And once the "making your life a living hell" was brought to our attention as well, this has led to you being suspended from your position. You have been an MR for the group for quite some time now, and having the situations on your plate gave us plenty of reason to mark the suspension.


[20-Jan-20 11:06 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
OHHH I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT THAT

[20-Jan-20 11:36 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
let me try


[20-Jan-20 11:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
@Beartikal done


[21-Jan-20 12:03 AM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack that‚Äôs not fireable-


[21-Jan-20 12:04 AM] emma;#1525
.-.


[21-Jan-20 12:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then undo it


[21-Jan-20 12:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
sorry im really done with school


[21-Jan-20 12:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

@Beartikal boy that isn‚Äôt a fireable offense lol


[21-Jan-20 12:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i'll undo then


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i could probably overturn that into a suspension


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] emma;#1525
that would be a warning or short suspension at worst


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] emma;#1525
But it‚Äôs not even suspension worthy


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] emma;#1525
Tbh


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'd say it's a suspension for two reasons:


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
3 days?


[21-Jan-20 12:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or 2 days


[21-Jan-20 12:06 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
3 days at the very least


[21-Jan-20 12:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok

Would;t the normal answer be 1-2


[21-Jan-20 06:14 AM] bman#0435
well lrs dont HAVE to do a certain amount a day but


[21-Jan-20 06:14 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but on average


[21-Jan-20 06:14 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Most do 1-2 a day


[21-Jan-20 06:14 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I think


[21-Jan-20 06:14 AM] bman#0435
o idk


[21-Jan-20 06:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'm not sure what's worse, the fact an LR is asking how many sessions and shifts they need to attend per day, or the fact that the MR who answered said LRs dont have to be active


[21-Jan-20 06:15 AM] bman#0435
e.e


[21-Jan-20 06:29 AM] stacey#1000
Oof


[21-Jan-20 06:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I think that an mr said they don‚Äôt need to be active is worse


[21-Jan-20 06:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
She could have said


[21-Jan-20 06:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
There‚Äôs no minimum but most do 1-2 a day


[21-Jan-20 06:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
There was definitely better ways to answer that question

Y‚Äôall are acting like she answered incorrectly but she literally said the right thing


[21-Jan-20 07:03 AM] emma;#1525
We won‚Äôt fire LRs for inactivity


[21-Jan-20 07:04 AM] emma;#1525
So they don‚Äôt technically have to be active at all to keep their jobs


[21-Jan-20 07:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; Yeah but we don't need to encourage inactivity lmao


[21-Jan-20 07:14 AM] xM_inn#2821

@xM_inn but we shouldn‚Äôt be lying either and telling them they should be going to 2 things a day


[21-Jan-20 07:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
Fair enough, so the MR could've just said LRs don't have activity requirements.

He‚Äôs asking me and every hr and senior host


[21-Jan-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
i answered the questions in a mature manner


[21-Jan-20 12:33 PM] stacey#1000
Did we even take a proper vote on it....


[21-Jan-20 12:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think we did.


[21-Jan-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
So why is slee messaging us...?


[21-Jan-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
no but i do love when heads come and ask me how i host so they can make a doc


[21-Jan-20 12:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@xM_inn hey bud you might wanna look at this


[21-Jan-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh i said he could


[21-Jan-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
he said two hrs gave him perm


[21-Jan-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
and he wanted final approval from me


[21-Jan-20 12:35 PM] stacey#1000
I thought we were going to make an announcement in staff announcements to see if majority of MRs actually want this, because I really don‚Äôt see a point but do at the same time.


[21-Jan-20 12:35 PM] bman#0435
we voted no


[21-Jan-20 12:35 PM] bman#0435
tho


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
Like MRs just have to read PMs....


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn, I think it's better for us to have it on our own.


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
emma did a vote and like we all voted no lol


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
well most of us


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
not all


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
how about we just promote slee to shift manager


[21-Jan-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not when it comes to situations like this


[21-Jan-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok


[21-Jan-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
so


[21-Jan-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
we promote him tomorrow


[21-Jan-20 12:37 PM] stacey#1000
Then we discussed the possibility of announcing it to MRs to let them vote and see if they really wanted it , and if majority did then we would do it.


[21-Jan-20 12:37 PM] stacey#1000
But....yeah. Now we are doing it and have to reply to slee and let him make the doc when we should be...?


[21-Jan-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; hi


[21-Jan-20 12:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know, seems a little bit biased.


[21-Jan-20 12:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't get me wrong, he knows what he's doing. But I think we should have him focus on being an MR than executive decision-making.


[21-Jan-20 12:39 PM] katie#0200
i agree


[21-Jan-20 12:39 PM] stacey#1000
Can we make a real vote for MRs...?


[21-Jan-20 12:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Love Slee, but I'm not sure if this is his place right now.

i wwnt legitimate stats


[21-Jan-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he should let us do it instead of him.


[21-Jan-20 12:40 PM] bman#0435
ya if anything it should be us


[21-Jan-20 12:40 PM] katie#0200
shouldnt we have announced that in staff announcements or something to actually get all of the mrs opinions


[21-Jan-20 12:40 PM] bman#0435
and put in the folder emma shared with us

Can we please do a real vote on staff announcements ALL MRs see and add reactions to it.


[21-Jan-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, I agree.


[21-Jan-20 12:40 PM] bman#0435
can we do a google poll insyead


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
where they only get 1 vote


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
instead of as many as they want


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
Slee made a vote but as I said before not ALL MRS saw it. Guaranteed


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
24 is literally 1/5 of our mrs


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly!!!


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
I said this all before


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
Which is why I‚Äôm pushing for a real vote


[21-Jan-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
There is more than 24 MRs


[21-Jan-20 12:42 PM] katie#0200
same, but i do feel that we should be the ones doing it not slee


[21-Jan-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
^^


[21-Jan-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
l gtg do a spanish test bwb


[21-Jan-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
I like slee brought this up but he shouldn‚Äôt be the one making the doc...


[21-Jan-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
Nor creating a voting poll


[21-Jan-20 12:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
100% agreed, I think he should slow down and take a back seat a little. That's not fair on behalf of the MR Team.


[21-Jan-20 12:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
hes only trying to help us


[21-Jan-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
Like if majority really want this we can all make a doc and add what we want to it


[21-Jan-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
Ik


[21-Jan-20 12:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I get that, but I think it's best for him to fulfill MR duties than actually doing what he's doing.


[21-Jan-20 12:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's doing a good job, but this would make more sense if he was still an HR.


[21-Jan-20 12:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Giving him this type of treatment seems a bit biased, no offense.


[21-Jan-20 12:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
We're not giving him treatment..?


[21-Jan-20 12:45 PM] stacey#1000
He is more then welcome to bring stuff to our attention, which is great he did bring this up


[21-Jan-20 12:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's literally like when Leak made his copied answer list.


[21-Jan-20 12:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't see why it's a big deal.


[21-Jan-20 12:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn, he said you authorized him to do something. This doesn't look very good considering that:


[21-Jan-20 12:45 PM] stacey#1000
Because we all voted against this....? And it‚Äôs still happening...?


[21-Jan-20 12:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) We were against it in the first place.


[21-Jan-20 12:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) I get that Slee has the experience, but he needs to focus on being an MR like everybody else at the moment. He's not even close to Senior Management yet.


[21-Jan-20 12:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
If you wanna make small problems into big problems then go ahead, but y'all can take over from here.


[21-Jan-20 12:47 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I guess I‚Äôll just reply to him, but all I‚Äôm saying is we should‚Äôve been informed he was authorized to do this when we voted against it.


[21-Jan-20 12:47 PM] stacey#1000
Or discussed it more


[21-Jan-20 12:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn, based on what I've learned so far, it feels like you may have gave him access without our notice. I don't think he should be involved in this kind of decision making yet.


[21-Jan-20 12:48 PM] stacey#1000
Because I think making a proper vote for the MR team to see would‚Äôve been great.


[21-Jan-20 12:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll do the same, Stacey.


[21-Jan-20 12:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
I gave him approval since it's something **small** and he's only being **helpful**.


[21-Jan-20 12:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn, I'm not sure if hosting preferences for a doc is a small thing, given that this seems more of our place than where he is right now. Five HRs did vote against it and Polk did mention that he was a bit salty of us not feeling it. With this in mind and the way he reacted to Polk, why exactly should we still go along with this?


[21-Jan-20 12:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Just confused, that's all.


[21-Jan-20 12:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
How is hosting preferences not a small thing?


[21-Jan-20 12:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
I give up.


[21-Jan-20 12:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright, do you want to discuss this more later on?


[21-Jan-20 01:01 PM] xM_inn#2821

[21-Jan-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000

[21-Jan-20 01:05 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Slee literally just wants to do something to help make other MRs lives easier and y'all are acting like he's wanting to expose all of our secrets and ruin our sessions. If you don't see a point to the document that's fine, but it's already been given approval and many MRs want it. Idc if you say "24 mrs is only 1/5th",  (which isn't 100% true) that's still a significant number and it's not like we're requiring all MRs to use it. I have no idea why you are all so against it still as it requires about 2 minutes of your time to answer Slee's questions. Stop being against MRs because you aren't willing to look at it from their side. It got approved by Minn because Minn realizes that it will be helpful for the MRs. Making it a personal thing about Slee "overstepping his boundaries" when he's just trying to contribute and help his fellow MRs is immature and not helping anyone.


[21-Jan-20 01:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But I'll go along with that too.


[21-Jan-20 01:05 PM] emma;#1525
Y'all are being selfish af sometimes and I'm not here for it


[21-Jan-20 01:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
for once i agree with emma


[21-Jan-20 01:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hold on.


[21-Jan-20 01:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How exactly is it immature? I'd like to know.


[21-Jan-20 01:10 PM] emma;#1525
Because you guys are LITERALLY not willing to even look at it from the MRs perspective


[21-Jan-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
It's all "i dont see how this is helpful" "Omg slee is just trying to be a mini HR" "this is dumb bc no one agreed to it"


[21-Jan-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
1) Anything that will make trainings easier for MRs is helpful


[21-Jan-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
2) Slee is a trusted MR, and if y'all don't trust him that isn't my fault. It's not like he's going to be the one announcing the doc, and we can make him share it with us so that we have editing perms. But it's his idea so he should have the opportunity to be involved.


[21-Jan-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
3) Y'all didn't agree to it at the start because I explained it badly and most of you assumed I meant that Slee would be giving out confidential training info (which we have none of anyways so that's kinda a weird assumption lol) and after I explained it more people went "ohhhh okay"


[21-Jan-20 01:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait, when did we do that? @emma;


[21-Jan-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
Which one


[21-Jan-20 01:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What you said for #3.


[21-Jan-20 01:13 PM] emma;#1525
Lemme find it


[21-Jan-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok.


[21-Jan-20 01:14 PM] stacey#1000
I already replied to slee so it‚Äôs done now. Doesn‚Äôt take long to respond and I never said I was against it. I just think we should‚Äôve been informed ahead of time he was authorized to do it that‚Äôs all.


[21-Jan-20 01:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[21-Jan-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What exactly did you say to him? @stacey


[21-Jan-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
Interview Procedure:

-At the beginning of the session, as I am about to begin rules all MRs are sent a PM stating they may choose their own offices. I never assign offices. 
-In the event there is more than 8 MRs on my server, I allow MRs to interview in the lobby area. 

-If the event there is not enough interviewees for each MR to have someone to interview, sharing an office with another MR is allowed. 
-In this same event, some managers and seniors may be assigned to supervise, given there is not enough interviewees.  

-Passers at Interviews: When there are passers in my interview session, I send a PM to all MRs at the beginning of the session stating MRs must use the pass command and teleport the passers to me. MRs should never remove a passer from the server, as if that happens a user may not be ranked. 

-Dismissal at interviews: If I send a PM stating MRs may leave when they are done, they are more than welcome to do so. In most cases, MRs must wait until the server is done to be dismissed. 

Training Procedures:

-All MRs must be professional at all times, even prior to a session beginning. Any unprofessional behaviour may result in consequences. This goes for all sessions, MRs are role models. 

-Heads: If you have to go AFK or leave the session before it is concluded, you MUST inform a management+ with a reason provided. If you are caught going AFK without informing anyone, or leaving the server you will be questioned. 

-Management+ must read all PMs carefully and not name or kick excess until given permission to do so. Failure to abide by PMs sent may result in a verbal warning.

i think


[21-Jan-20 02:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that when the plate people


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
"die" or "go under the map"


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they dont


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i cuffed one the other day


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and got glitched under the map with them


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i died


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and they just were floating


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
under the map


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] bman#0435

[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and then i think they reset idk tho


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or tped


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they didnt keep falling like i did


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and we should have died at the same time


[21-Jan-20 02:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc i exploded like normal and he just was floating there


[21-Jan-20 02:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
with the plates


[21-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809

but then I think one of u said they can

[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
anna told me she thought this was fine, but ethan told her its lack of detail


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes.


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] emma;#1525
I mean saying "i like it to take orders" is not proper grammar


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
in my opinion its like the bare minimum, not lack of detail


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] emma;#1525
same with "i also like it to make drinks"


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
ikr


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] emma;#1525
so that's two strikes


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's way too short in length tbh.


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
and they said


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] emma;#1525
"I will treat everyone nice and good" is the third


[21-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
"Because" in the beginning of the sentence


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
so they failed due to 3 grammar strikes ok


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Definitely a fail for sure.


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
I don't like giving strikes for starting a sentence with "Because"


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
but there are three other strikes


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
so the lack of detail isn't even a factor yet and it should have failed


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] katie#0200
@High Rank Hadley wants another announcement on interacting with CBs, because she saw this on her shift: https://gyazo.com/552c662f87cb393cebec15a4d1eeb5d5 What do you think? Announcement or no, since it's only one person- EDIT: South was also not kicking CBs properly, and apparently Saab had to remind people not to talk to lced and kick instead, since some people weren't kicking

[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596

[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
i'll point out the grammar mistakes to her


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
yea


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, I don't think we should repeat ourselves.


[21-Jan-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
Is this literally why so many people have been failing trainings


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
literally I can have 10 trainees in a server and 8 will fail for grammar


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
whereas it used to be 8 would **pass**


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
just talk to that one person


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For my experience, no.


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They just don't have very good grammar.


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
Most people who pass interviews should have good enough grammar to pass trainings


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
announcement


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
It doesn't make sense that so many are failing for grammar now


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
because


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
south also did that


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
if u look up to my ping


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
That just means that we're failing somewhere either in interviews or applications


[21-Jan-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
baby and bear told us to be less strict on grammar


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] katie#0200
oh yeah


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] katie#0200
vote pls bman^^


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
and my bet is emily and anna, who do a lot of applications, are passing too many with bad grammar


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
im sure that's not 100% the cause


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
but i bet its a bigger factor


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I've told them them this before. And I quote:


[21-Jan-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
hm


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525
I mean if it continues being an issue I say we suspend them both from doing applications


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
emma


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525
Not a full suspension (unless y'all want that)


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
this is


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525
just from doing apps


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
like


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Alright, so for the first one, they didn't actually mention a rank on Q1. They just said they seek a high rank gain of trust, which is pretty vague and doesn't mention the LR ranks at all. Secondly, they have acquired three grammar mistakes. They've failed to capitalize "hotels" considering that Nova is a group name, and they have also missed a period in Q7. On Q4, instead of "I'm active 7/10 in ROBLOX.", they could change it up to "I'm an active 7/10 on ROBLOX." You can also see in Q5 that there's not much effort provided, and the lack of detail example you brought up was exactly that."


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
their second time being told again


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
since last time


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

lol


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
well it was one application


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
so if it happens again then im saying suspend


[21-Jan-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525
that's-

Uh-


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
keep in mind baby said not to be too strict on apps


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
we need to find a standard for reviewing apps


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] emma;#1525
there's a difference between not being strict and passing people with obviously bad grammar


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, but I don't think the apps are very good on what they have passed.


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
because not being too strict can be taken differently from person to person


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This was one of them.


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
true


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] emma;#1525
Starting a sentence with "Because?" acceptable. Throwing random "it"s before words that make 0 sense? Less acceptable.


[21-Jan-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have another one, so let me get that.

This originally failed due to question 7, but I've found around 3 mistakes.


[21-Jan-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
See that one to *me* is more forgivable


[21-Jan-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
Because they wrote a lot more


[21-Jan-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
seeking*


[21-Jan-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
And saying "out" instead of "put" is clearly a typo


[21-Jan-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
Same with "seeming" because the k and m are next to each other


[21-Jan-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah it's not great and I wouldn't be upset if someone failed it


[21-Jan-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
but I *personally* may have passed it


[21-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That was 2 out of the 3 that I was looking for.


[21-Jan-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
I think the "Three grammar strikes and you're out" can be a bit less strict only if the person is writing a lot. Ofc people will have more mistakes the more they write, so if they make 4 very very minor mistakes but answer with 3-4 detailed sentences it should be a pass


[21-Jan-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oof, they spelled effort wrong.


[21-Jan-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
yeah not sure how they put an n into effort


[21-Jan-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
i like to think that it was a mistake but like that one is less obvious then "out" or "Seeming" lol


[21-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
a lot of people that write a lot just repeat themselves lol


[21-Jan-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Eh, I don't know, I'm not really feeling this one.


[21-Jan-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
im not saying we shouldnt be less strict tho, im just saying it to say it

Because we went over it in press conference a month ago


[21-Jan-20 03:47 PM] katie#0200
south wasnt kicking properly and apparently saab was telling people to kick cbs instead of talking to them


[21-Jan-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt see why we should announce it


[21-Jan-20 03:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
south didn't actually really interact with them, she just kicked unprofessionally


[21-Jan-20 03:47 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[21-Jan-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank I know we've gotten a lot of pings recently, but I think we need to look into Kitten. Look at her Nitro emotes on the booster lounge.

hoes are mad


[21-Jan-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey are you counting "hoe" as a word they can't use in gd either bc a lot of people have said hoe in gd without punishment


[21-Jan-20 05:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm, many uses of the word are mainly talking about a gardening hoe when I searched it up. Here, I don't think the term was appropriate here in the channel, that's why I got concerned. @emma;


[21-Jan-20 05:22 PM] emma;#1525
I would personally give her a written warning. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something that would warrant a suspension to fix.


[21-Jan-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs just my opinion though.

@High Rank CBs are taking advantage of alternative accounts to get jobs, as we all know. These accounts are mainly seen within secondary servers, as in servers hosted by Seniors. From what, I'd say, many of us have seen, Seniors don't mind checking backgrounds or anything of the most suspicious accounts and just forward their names on to the host. Now, sometimes they'll add (possible CB) next to the name, which will lead me not to rank, but Seniors are passing accounts that are as little as 0 or 1 day old. I feel there should be a strong reminder directed towards Seniors, or it should just be an enforced hosting rule. They are all capable of catching CBs and questioning them, they just don't appear to even care about checking and seem rather lazy to do it. Let me know some of your input on this, this is just to help prevent Seniors from passing too many CBs, if not any at all.

[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
@bman if you didn't ask her to keep them there BEFORE she kicked that's literally not her fault lol


[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] bman#0435
ok then how abt that attitude


[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
and unless you sent out a pm saying "anyone with low account age needs to be kept so i can question them" or something similar to all the MRs it's again, not her fault


[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
what attitude?


[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
that's not even attitude


[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
you clearly flustered her


[21-Jan-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
because she wasn't expecting you to confront her about something you never instructed her to do

we're going to need some clarification on some things regarding some management+ things in the discord server. ive noticed lots of confusion about these certain topics for a long time and it really needs to be cleared up. here are the topics that have caused a lot of confusion: "Do we decline a report for incorrect format?" "Do we warn for incorrect format?" & "Do we count an incorrect format warning towards a kick?"

i thought the teport replated stuff dont count towards a kick


[22-Jan-20 10:55 AM] bman#0435
thats what ive been told as a manager


[22-Jan-20 10:55 AM] bman#0435
but there were like 10 rules when i was


[22-Jan-20 10:55 AM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
it doesn't count towards a kick from what I was told


[22-Jan-20 10:55 AM] bman#0435

@¬¢. ·É¶ No you shouldn't recline a report for incorrect format (that is so dumb lmao we need to ban people regardless). Yes you warn for incorrect format. No you don't count an incorrect format warning towards a kick.

[22-Jan-20 12:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[22-Jan-20 12:06 PM] bman#0435
yes


[22-Jan-20 12:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
FAT proposal here


[22-Jan-20 12:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
SO


[22-Jan-20 12:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We add a channel in the DC


[22-Jan-20 12:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
For calling an MR


[22-Jan-20 12:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
On top of the group wall


[22-Jan-20 12:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We can also make it a requirement for checklists


[22-Jan-20 12:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I mean discord is much faster than the group wall in my opinion


[22-Jan-20 12:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But that doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt use the group wall anymore


[22-Jan-20 12:11 PM] emma;#1525
we'd have to make some big rules about that


[22-Jan-20 12:12 PM] emma;#1525
bc MRs will get very annoyed at being spam pinged


[22-Jan-20 12:12 PM] emma;#1525
it would have to be a "only ping MRs who statuses say 'available for calls'" type of thing


[22-Jan-20 12:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sounds good


[22-Jan-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Have any more regulations besides that @emma;


[22-Jan-20 12:22 PM] bman#0435
we should have like a 5 min cooldown if we have that channel to limit spam and such


[22-Jan-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435
since people spam the group wall too


[22-Jan-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[22-Jan-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
Not a bad idea


[22-Jan-20 12:27 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I like that


[22-Jan-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
We should just give the MRs a heads up BEFORE making the channel live


[22-Jan-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
and I think we could alter one of the shift requirements for managers/seniors to be "Do a shift OR respond to 10 calls for MR assistance"


[22-Jan-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
that way they can do a shift if that's more convenient at the time but if they have the opportunity to respond to calls they can do that too


[22-Jan-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
so there's no penalty if there aren't a ton of calls one wek


[22-Jan-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
week*


[22-Jan-20 12:33 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
I agree


[22-Jan-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
i dont feel like 10 would be a fair amount considering theyd just have to join and kick a player


[22-Jan-20 12:46 PM] bman#0435
which takes like not even 1 minute


[22-Jan-20 12:49 PM] emma;#1525
It is an effort though to pend into servers, assess whether a kick was needed or not, and potentially submit reports


[22-Jan-20 12:49 PM] emma;#1525
Plus with so many MRs it would be hard to expect our whole management and senior team to do more then 10 a week if heads are also going


[22-Jan-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435
or anna and emily would attend to them all üò≥


[22-Jan-20 12:52 PM] emma;#1525
üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨


[22-Jan-20 12:52 PM] emma;#1525
probably


[22-Jan-20 12:52 PM] emma;#1525
that‚Äôs why it would be optional to replace it with a shift instead


[22-Jan-20 12:52 PM] emma;#1525

@emma; word. I think we should have a similar format as reports. Sorta like staff discussion but without tagging and have a check mark for a completed request.

@xM_inn


[22-Jan-20 07:12 PM] bman#0435
@xM_inn sorry for not responding to slee yet but thats the least of my worries atm. i have more important priorities to set straight irl due to the semester ending and class changes. i havent had time to write to him how my sessions are, even tho its all said in pms. ill respond when i have legitimate time and can give accurate information over rushed information


[22-Jan-20 07:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bman i only asked you to reply to his dms.. just because u dont agree with the idea doesn't mean u need to take a long time before replying, it'd literally take you 10 minutes minimum. im not saying you don't have other priorities and stuff, but you're hosting in like an hour so i just hope you're not being awkward cause you disagree with the idea..


[22-Jan-20 07:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think he is-


[22-Jan-20 07:16 PM] bman#0435
i didnt say not liking his idea was my reason for delaying a response tho...


[22-Jan-20 07:17 PM] bman#0435
it had nothing to do with it lol


[22-Jan-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[22-Jan-20 10:03 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Jan-20 10:05 PM] stacey#1000
Tommy, the guy that came up with the oof sound offered roblox they could legally buy the copyright ownership of the oof sound from him but roblox doesn‚Äôt want to pay


[22-Jan-20 10:05 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Jan-20 10:15 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
alr ill tag and see if anyone else is interested in terminating her since she is still continuing her bad behavior


[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
If I fall asleep I vote yes for firing


[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd wait for Minn and see what he thinks


[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
And tagging


[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
We can‚Äôt do it without votes


[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
So


[22-Jan-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

There's two ways you can have punishments happen


[22-Jan-20 10:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
5 votes or a BoD


[22-Jan-20 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
I already knew that


[22-Jan-20 10:17 PM] bman#0435
ya but the point of the votes is to give the bods an idea of what we think


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying add a vote


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
ya id vote


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
u cant rly go wrong with it either way


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
because a bod will see it no matter what


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm I was thinking to wait until all day tomorrow but


[22-Jan-20 10:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[22-Jan-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
And


[22-Jan-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000

i finally couldnt take it anymore and i took the opportunity to block her


[23-Jan-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Let's vote on the idea Ramm had yesterday. The idea is to make a new channel in the discord server specifically meant for calling **MRs** to the hotel to kick trollers/exploiters/etc. We would put a cooldown in the server (Probably a few minutes) to avoid spamming. Managers/Seniors will have their cards adjusted so that one shift requirement will be altered to say "Shift OR 10(?) responses to MR calls". Responses can be counted from the wall or the discord server. We won't allow pings to HRs in this channel since we have the reports channels and MRs can request a ban in discussion. More info below so this isn't a huge ping lol

oo i like that


[23-Jan-20 01:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm good with this


[23-Jan-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
They would ONLY be allowed to ping MRs with statuses that say "Available for calls" right now. May change later if this works well.


[23-Jan-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
i like it but we should put a 5/10 min cooldown on it


[23-Jan-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
probs a 5 min


[23-Jan-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
Pinging an HR or an MR who doesn't have the status would be a warning, but the warning would NOT count towards a kick.


[23-Jan-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
If they did it enough then it could but not like 1-2.


[23-Jan-20 01:25 PM] bman#0435
i still think it should be more than 10 responses tho


[23-Jan-20 01:25 PM] bman#0435
since it seems prty little


[23-Jan-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
I think we should start at 10 and then we can always adjust it as needbe


[23-Jan-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
Obviously a simple kick won't take much time

oh addie


[23-Jan-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
But I'm going to go ahead with the assumption that people will rejoin once kicked and it'll end up being a longer ordeal where the MR has to call for assistance


[23-Jan-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
at least 1-2 of the times


[23-Jan-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
again we'll be able to adjust it plenty if it seems too easy to just do 10, that's why it can only fill one requirement


[23-Jan-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
also it would be per RESPONSE to a call, not per time kicking. So if they stay for 10 minutes to kick someone 20 times, it would still be one response


[23-Jan-20 01:28 PM] bman#0435
how would we know they stayed in that one server for that much time and called it 10 times tho


[23-Jan-20 01:28 PM] emma;#1525
we won't


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
but if they call for HR assistance then we'll know


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
actually


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] bman#0435
like idk i just have suspicions that someone will stay, kick someone 10 times, and call that theire requirements


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
I mean it is gonna be a partial honor system


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
at some point you do have to actually trust the MRs


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
but a lot of them will go to the hotel and be afk for 10 mintues and not log it


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] bman#0435
ya abt that


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
we can't control everything, if they're gonna cheat some they're gonna cheat some


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] bman#0435
shouldnt they be logging afk times


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] bman#0435
even if they dont have any


[23-Jan-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
yeah they should be saying 0 mins


[23-Jan-20 01:30 PM] emma;#1525
if they don't have any


[23-Jan-20 01:30 PM] bman#0435
k well half the seniors dont do that


[23-Jan-20 01:31 PM] emma;#1525
then put up an announcement reminded them?


[23-Jan-20 01:31 PM] emma;#1525
reminding*


[23-Jan-20 01:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
OMG Emma thanks for the mention


[23-Jan-20 01:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I feel so blessed to be mentioned in a positive way by Emma herself


[23-Jan-20 01:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

Lol


[23-Jan-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn we could have managers track it on hotel logs to give them incentive to do it


[23-Jan-20 01:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
Sure


[23-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
idk we can figure something out that‚Äôll work lol


[23-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
Honestly manager activity cards would be amazing


[23-Jan-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525
We don‚Äôt have too many managers where it would suck hopefully


[23-Jan-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn that‚Äôs ur job so up to you lol


[23-Jan-20 02:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hmm I'll think about it


[23-Jan-20 02:01 PM] xM_inn#2821

Do I just automatically decline her orrr


[23-Jan-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

ye but i told her to basically leave us alone several times


[23-Jan-20 04:11 PM] bman#0435
well she may have misunderstood what u said abt the appeal


[23-Jan-20 04:11 PM] bman#0435
because its obvious she had no intentions to do anything bad when she joined saab, considering she wasnt trolling or spamming or doing any of that stuff (based off the screenshot)


[23-Jan-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
perhaps but she's not getting appealed from the discord anytime soon


[23-Jan-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like there's too much things to count on what she did on the platform


[23-Jan-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cursed around 3 hrs out, was apart of the circumventing crew, acted really awful towards j0wanna, etc

i found something else


[23-Jan-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she tried to sneak in my christmas themed session, i think i had it on the 23rd


[23-Jan-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
darren and a few managements saw her soooo


[23-Jan-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
unsure of what to do here


[23-Jan-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey well it does seem like you told her she was appealed at the hotel


[23-Jan-20 04:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm


[23-Jan-20 04:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What are ur recommendations


[23-Jan-20 04:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm thinking of telling her that she mistook my words then run a voting of her appeal


[23-Jan-20 04:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
From there, I'll see if she's going to have it accepted


[23-Jan-20 04:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

**SHIFT LOGGING AND READING APPLICATIONS**

Greetings Seniors,

I am making this announcement as a reminder of your expectations when it comes to logging your shifts and reading applications. The HR team has noticed this happening and would like to correct the current habits you have.

**SHIFT LOGGING:** When logging a shift, you are to _ALWAYS_ log the AFK time, even if you didn't go AFK. This is and has been a requirement for your activity cards.

**READING APPLICATIONS:** When reading applications, please do not skim through it. We ask that you thoroughly read each and every sentence that an applicant sends in. We have noticed more and more copied and pasted answers or failed applications getting passed each week.

I hope you take these reminders into consideration for when you continue to do these activities. Thank you for reading.

I dunno about the "skimming" sentence, I usually go through the shitty apps just to make the process quicker


[23-Jan-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435

I mean I never ask


[23-Jan-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435

[23-Jan-20 06:01 PM] emma;#1525
Once we figure out what addie is doing now we can move forward


[23-Jan-20 06:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

**SESSION PASSERS:** As most of you know, many CBs attempt to gain staff accounts. Please feel free to question the lowly-aged and suspicious accounts, it barely takes any time away from the reality of the session. If you did question them but are still left suspicious with them being ranked, please leave a note on the side of their name in the session card saying "(possible CB)" or "(suspicious)". That way, when we go to look and rank passers, we will know who to take caution over ranking and ultimately decide if they are suspicious or not.

[24-Jan-20 12:45 AM] ethan;#0003
why would we announce that to a bunch of 10 year olds


[24-Jan-20 12:45 AM] ethan;#0003
they dont have 30$


[24-Jan-20 12:45 AM] ethan;#0003
so they cant be scammed


[24-Jan-20 01:04 AM] emma;#1525
@Polk pretty sure afk time has been a regular thing for a while lol


[24-Jan-20 01:04 AM] emma;#1525
We make managers do it so why not seniors


[24-Jan-20 01:21 AM] ethan;#0003
its the opposite


[24-Jan-20 01:21 AM] ethan;#0003

but not managers


[24-Jan-20 06:26 AM] Polk#1596
Well, Bonnie told us not to log the AFK time, so logging the AFK time isn't something they are required to do unless Min wants to make that into an official rule. Since he took over the checklists, I guess it's his decision now. @emma;


[24-Jan-20 06:28 AM] bman#0435
well since ethan didnt rly tell me anythung for my promo so senior, i always thought u needed afk times. i also asked min if i could announce it an he said sure

Hm, alright. In your announcement, you just wrote it in a way that sounded like you expected them to know that you must log the AFK time when they have been told not to log it for a long time, but if Min agreed to it, I guess it's all good.

@bman anna is confused: 

uh so i found this but i always thought of lack of detail being like "im kind. im helpful. im nice." but these were actual sentences thats why i was a bit confused because i feel like if they were said in an interview they might have been passed but i completely understand if not

yeah but they aren't very good ones here @xM_inn


[24-Jan-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you can also see them missing periods on Q4 and Q7 too

idk, these people are only kids


[24-Jan-20 05:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
true but i think they've could have done way better here


[24-Jan-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but that's just my opinion tho


[24-Jan-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i noticed that a lot of sentences end very quickly which isn't very good


[24-Jan-20 05:47 PM] bman#0435
it isnt very detailed. i understand that theyre only kids but there are kids their age or maybe even younger that add much more detail than that. im not saying it was an easily failed application, but a small add-on or a little more detail to their sentences wouldve made it more appealing and a worthy app (to me)


[24-Jan-20 05:47 PM] bman#0435
also i dont see y anna wouldnt ask me lol


[24-Jan-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[24-Jan-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we've had numerous people who are at a young age who provide much better detail than this


[24-Jan-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
granted, they are a different breed compared to everyone else but they're still technically kids

M So, are you all ready for laser tag??? I haven‚Äôt hosted any recently. Plus it‚Äôs Friday!!!

M Okay, before we begin laser tag, I have a few rules to state.

M Rule 1: No cheating, if you glitch and get hit you are still out.

M Rule 2: You must treat everyone fairly, as this is for fun.

M Rule 3: Spread out when I say so and do not start shooting until the countdown is done.

M One more thing I forgot before we begin. Please congratulate Hadleyyxo on her promotion to management!!!

@High Rank Slee recorded Bloxton General VC as evidence that an LR owned an alternative account, though recording a VC is not allowed. The video is unlisted, meaning you can only see it by link, but it is still a video with the voices and VC an such so if anyone knows what to do please say so. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMD-TvEqs9w&feature=youtu.be

Hello there user
Hello there user. I can see you. The sneering grin that rides along your face. Mocking me. Just like you did to all of my friends. Who am I, may you ask? I have many different names. STRAINED, RADIATION, PYTHON, AGITATED, DESTRUCTION, ANNIHILATION, DIVINITY, EXHAUSTED, and MO...

When I mock someone, I am warned and told that I could hurt people's feelings. What do you think I felt when you all mocked me? It started getting to my head. I cried one time. I started having suicidal thoughts. Our feelings are just as fragile as yours. We are humans too. But we are left outcasted from your community.


[25-Jan-20 12:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[25-Jan-20 12:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

then why do it


[25-Jan-20 12:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
So funny. I was so incredibly proud when one day he excitedly announced to me that he was RANK 11. Unfortunately, Lucas isn‚Äôt as popular with the other CBs, though. They all kind of hate him. I hope you get HR some day, Lucas.


[25-Jan-20 12:47 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
nope hes never getting it now üôÇ


[25-Jan-20 12:47 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

@Beartikal can u update the training centre and interview centre like u did the hotel for no exploits, all exploits move to interviews now i had to ban a couple earlier, like the flinging exploits.


[25-Jan-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
when they rage and cant do it at the hotel they go to interviews and stuff now lmao


[25-Jan-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and i quote:


[25-Jan-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
*** Recently though, beartikal made a very smart move. This would change Blox-ton forever. What Beartikal did would prove to be rather effective. Turning off player collision would make flinging impossible now. This change I did not mind all too much. But when he made patches to the food is where things got heavy. He had patched all exploits. I have tried vigorously to work around these patches but to no avail.***

[25-Jan-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
I find it hilarious they think we will miss them and have nothing to do especially security. Bro there will always be trollers no matter what we do. They were there long before CBs.

[25-Jan-20 02:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Amiee refers herself as "Alloe" so that's strike one


[25-Jan-20 02:16 PM] bman#0435

I‚Äôll make an announcement on it


[25-Jan-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank Okay, so recently one of our MRs, rank 9 southkoreahn changes his name to margrettehatcher3113 (something like that). She acts like she is a whole new MR and tells people she was promoted today and is basically joking around but taking it too far. She is also being quite rude to a manager in DMs when questioned about it. I‚Äôll send all evidence.  She will need a suspension or termination, also might be hacked have no clue. Sorry for the ping evidence will be down below.

[25-Jan-20 04:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think there's a good chance it might be her, given that we don't exactly know her that well.


[25-Jan-20 04:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Plus, if she was actually hacked, she would have contacted any of us for a heads up. Her account is her own responsibility.


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs hacked lol


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
She's currently suspended indefinitely.


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
Why?


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
Until we prove she's not hacked.


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
She‚Äôs literally not hacked


[25-Jan-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
And confirm whether she is hacked.


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
She‚Äôs not acting like she is hacked


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
How tf do yall think she‚Äôs hacked-


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
Have you looked at all evidence?


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
Man people start messing around a bit and suddenly they‚Äôre hacked


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
Wait did Stacey post all evidence?


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525

I looked at everything posted here


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
Minn this is what happens when you rush me to send her a letter


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey Post her DMs with Alex


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry, but this doesn't look like a hack.


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
I did


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
She did post the DMs


[25-Jan-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you shouldn‚Äôt have rushed this


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Ok who wants to question her now


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
I gtg


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
No one else thinks it‚Äôs a hacker situation lol


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll do it.


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
Trey, you literally agreed with us in the other GC. You always change your decision to Emma's decision.


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When did I agree?


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When I meant a suspension, I mean an **actual** punishment.


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn trey said that before I did


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Well


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
So no need to accuse trey of that


[25-Jan-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
Since it‚Äôs not true


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
üôÑ


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
Suspension because really no clue if she‚Äôs hacked


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
I doubt it


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
But


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821

I stg this team is the reason I‚Äôll die young


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
üòÇ


[25-Jan-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hacked or not, we still need to figure out why she was acting the way she was so she can stay suspended for now.


[25-Jan-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright, then I'll question them talking about their behavior.


[25-Jan-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
Someone dm her she wants to know long and crap ok fr gtg now bye


[25-Jan-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
She wasn‚Äôt acting out of the ordinary lmao


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
People got butthurt she was joking around


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
And she got defensive


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
And was slightly rude about it


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
Mk so it's normal for someone to change their name and pretend to not be themselves?


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
I just skimmed her messages in SL


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
She didn‚Äôt pretend to not be herself when I talked to her in sl


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
She admitted to being south


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
IN STAFF LOUNGE


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
She told people in general discussion that she's a new MR who was promoted today....


[25-Jan-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
yeah it‚Äôs called a joke minn


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm not saying it was the best one to make


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
But you automatically assuming she was hacked without thinking deeper into the situation kinda sucks


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
.


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
An MR has fun you don‚Äôt agree with and there must be something wrong


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Unsuspend her then.


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm on mobile


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
You clearly know best.


[25-Jan-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
And trey is already questioning her


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
Apparently since trey only agrees with my opinion!!!


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
Even when he has it first


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs still my fault he has it


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
Man


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I agree emma !


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I don‚Äôt really know what happened but


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Unless she‚Äôs hacked I don‚Äôt think we can do much


[25-Jan-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn If you‚Äôre not gonna stand up for your opinion, don‚Äôt be mad that people agree with mine


[25-Jan-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt back down lol but y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt either


[25-Jan-20 04:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
To be honest, I do not think she's hacked.


[25-Jan-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt have all the answers but it seems like no one is willing to have a productive discussion most of the time


[25-Jan-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
One person disagrees and suddenly it‚Äôs a big issue


[25-Jan-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôm in the car now


[25-Jan-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
So here‚Äôs what I think


[25-Jan-20 04:57 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Omg me too!


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
Even if she wasn‚Äôt hacked


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
It should still be a real suspension for acting unprofessional at trainings and joking too far


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
and disrespect


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think she was hacked but part of me still thought she was at first


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
So either way


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
Still a real suspension


[25-Jan-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
She made people think she was hacked


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
Not just myself


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
But MRs tok


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
Too


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
I think Alex overreacted too


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt think we should suspend her


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
Alex and Nicole


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
Well I guess we could for the stuff in game


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
Are the ones that brought this to my attention


[25-Jan-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
But Alex shouldn‚Äôt be calling people out in SL either


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
And she should have told an HR first if she thought someone was hacked


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
Instead of trying to play mini HR and handle it herself


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
She didn‚Äôt think right away they were hacked


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I disagree, it feels like South kind of started this to begin with. And with her being disrespectful at trainings, I think she made her situation x2 worse.


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
Then why is that what she‚Äôs accusing her of


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that's just my opinion.


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
south probably wanted the attention /shrug


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
The being disrespectful at trainings is valid I agree


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@xAfroTrey was that proof connected to the announcement


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
The one at training


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
She brought it to attention that she was acting like a new mr and thought joke was taken too far


[25-Jan-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't forget DMs too, she wasn't very nice.


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that's just me.


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
Neither was Alex lol


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
Emma if she really want


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
You can be added


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
To GC


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
Where Alex explained


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
In vc


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know, I think Alex was understandably upset here.


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
Alex was upset


[25-Jan-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
And explained better in vc


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
To minn and myself


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
And  Bman


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
And trey


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Shouldn‚Äôt Alex have came to us about it


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She did.


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
She did


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3 of us at least.


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs exactly what she did


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
She told me first


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
I added u to the GC if u wanna look at the messages regarding it @emma;


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
Then I added Bman and trey


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman, Stacey, and I had a VC with them.


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Then why did she investigate


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
She didn‚Äôt


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
god I‚Äôm so CONFUSED


[25-Jan-20 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
And that'll also prove I didn't rush into my decision of suspending her.. I was reasonably concerned.

Alex was just there for the reporting, not the actual investigation.


[25-Jan-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For South though, I don't like the way she's acting here.


[25-Jan-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Talking about her peers in this matter in a public setting is a big no-no. And I don't think LRs should have to see that.


[25-Jan-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
Alex is literally still investigating


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
Her and Nicole shouldn‚Äôt be involved anymore if they sent all the proof


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey did you question her yet


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma, I think they're just giving us proof.


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And yes, I'm waiting for her response.


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
What did you send?


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not much, I just asked to talk with her.


[25-Jan-20 05:05 PM] bman#0435

[25-Jan-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What is it?


[25-Jan-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
The ‚Äúwhen you were promoted we asked you a security question‚Äù then make up a question and see what she does


[25-Jan-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
If she makes up an answer it means she‚Äôs hacked or lying


[25-Jan-20 05:08 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey and me


[25-Jan-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
If she is confused then it‚Äôs most likely her

Ok part of me thinks south was never hacked and is a CB.

@stacey i ranked ur passers


[25-Jan-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
I mean it makes sense. He gets MR for a couple weeks then acts like this, I mean for sure any CB would act out like that. And, then there is all of a sudden this major spammer AFTER he gets suspended leaking stuff or trying to.

@High Rank **cory sent me this just now** Hello, sorry for disrupting you if you are busy with hosting or other stuff, but I think there's a situation with southkoreahn. So I went to the hotel and someone was continuously spamming that MRs had a private chat and that southkoreahn was a CB. I don't have proof of south actually leaking stuff since the troller wouldnt provide that to me because they didnt want her to get in trouble. They said they leaked certain things like staff lounge and the CB list, and he said the he has the link. I just want to make you aware that southkoreahn might be a possible CB, but not certain though, so I would just keep alert of them 

Heres proof of him saying this: https://gyazo.com/8d452b1442db4a5993ffdb13d18ec5f1 https://gyazo.com/8bc9e7b296b10fd89a44a4cd66cbef5c https://gyazo.com/4881a550f96dc51d65556758dd08758f

[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
the whole ic a staff area


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
i could but i dont see why it matters


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
what brought this up trey


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
but hotel guests can enter


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
seems like a lot development tho


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
well at the beginning of my interview session there was 2 people flying outside the window


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
isn't that technically a redesign @Polk


[26-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
waiting for me to start to come in and say "hi welcome to chillis XDDD"


[26-Jan-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596
um no


[26-Jan-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596
its just an area


[26-Jan-20 12:22 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
TREYYYTYYYYNNHGFHDHD


[26-Jan-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596
but i realized


[26-Jan-20 12:23 PM] Polk#1596
the collision thing is turned off at the tc


[26-Jan-20 12:23 PM] Polk#1596
so i guess bear did what he could to the ic and tc as well


[26-Jan-20 12:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
flying exploits arent patched either


[26-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
they are extremely hard to detect


[26-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
the same goes for walkspeed exploits


[26-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you were a dev you would know why and why its a struggle


[26-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
i could fix it up on the client, but within a week- 2 weeks they could break it


[26-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont have a permanent solution for those


[26-Jan-20 12:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
so i never bothered to do temporary fixes


[26-Jan-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[26-Jan-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
i mean as long as they dont fling me up to the moon its fine


[26-Jan-20 12:27 PM] Polk#1596
i just didnt notice u did the same changes to the ic and tc


[26-Jan-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not gonna lie


[26-Jan-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i rarely see any exploits at the hotel now


[26-Jan-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it feels really nice


[26-Jan-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000

What the hell is wrong with you?


[26-Jan-20 03:06 PM] ethan;#0003
Why are you getting so defensive over this?


[26-Jan-20 03:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so:


[26-Jan-20 03:06 PM] ethan;#0003
Ill delete it if it really makes you that mad


[26-Jan-20 03:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ethan, this should've never been posted.


[26-Jan-20 03:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That could really rub others the wrong way, you know better.


[26-Jan-20 03:07 PM] ethan;#0003
nobody follows my twitter


[26-Jan-20 03:07 PM] ethan;#0003
i have like 300 followers


[26-Jan-20 03:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That doesn't mean they could still see it.


[26-Jan-20 03:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
My bad for getting so defensive, but this is a really tragic time for nearly a lot of people.


[26-Jan-20 03:09 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah I know


[26-Jan-20 03:09 PM] ethan;#0003
But like I just wasn't really understanding why you got so defensive because ive never seen you like that before


[26-Jan-20 03:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I mean trey is kinda right. this is impacting a lot of people


[26-Jan-20 03:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ethan, I kind of felt this because it was a little distasteful and disrespectful to be honest with you.


[26-Jan-20 03:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Though I'm not gonna lie, you're right, I don't really act this way too often.


[26-Jan-20 03:13 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah, Im sorry. It was an impulse decision to post that, I was in a vc and they where making a joke about it.


[26-Jan-20 03:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@xAfroTrey omg r u watching too


[26-Jan-20 08:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh guys


[26-Jan-20 08:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
how do you guys feel if an mr tells a random person of why they're demoted/suspended


[26-Jan-20 08:25 PM] emma;#1525
why would an MR know that reasoning


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
i mean i dont really care since people have a right to know why they were demoted/suspended if they ask


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
but MRs shouldn't know the exact reason the majority of the time


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well we usually inform them about that in the letter


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
no we dont lol


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
we dont send letters to LRs


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
the majority of the time


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
OH


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The board thing already tells them why they‚Äôre suspended so I don‚Äôt think that ones a big deal


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i meant that for MRs emma lol


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
im not sure that works anymore lol


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[26-Jan-20 08:26 PM] emma;#1525
she told an MR why they were demoted/suspended?


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
it does


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Hi beanmannn


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
some snnoying people spam my dms to unsuspend them :)


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
actually we don't know who the person is


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] emma;#1525
MRs don't know about that stuff unless we announce it since that's private trey so if MRs are finding that stuff out then YIKES


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
HI COOEIIEIEIE


[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Or demoted


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But like shouldn‚Äôt they know already bc we send letters to mrs


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] emma;#1525
we havent had any recent suspensions or demotions other than south recently


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
apparently i've been told an LR is aware about a suspension


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like the reason or that someone was suspended


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
an lr is aware about a reasoning of an mr's suspension?


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah someone dm'd tate about it


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what do you guys think


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
so the mr who was suspended mustve told someone, odd


[26-Jan-20 08:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Did the MR tell the LR that knows


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think the LR is unaware


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wha


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because they said they were scared


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Unaware of what


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think this is what happened


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the LR was unaware about the MRs suspension


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[26-Jan-20 08:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Do u have pictures


[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think they may have asked and the person told them


[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no


[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what the LR wants to know is


[26-Jan-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
is it considered leaking

oops i thought about it the other way around my bad


[26-Jan-20 09:49 PM] emma;#1525
wdym the other way around


[26-Jan-20 09:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i thought she meant one of the boards higher than her role but what i also find interesting are her two messages before this


[26-Jan-20 09:50 PM] emma;#1525
why


[26-Jan-20 09:50 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[26-Jan-20 09:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so


[26-Jan-20 09:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
70% of me think she's hacked, the other 30% thinks this might be cookie 2.0


[26-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think she's hacked lmao


[26-Jan-20 09:52 PM] emma;#1525
did you talk to her yet


[26-Jan-20 09:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i did the animal tatic and welll


[26-Jan-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
i dont think shes hacked but idk im starting to get sus abt her being a cb because while theres no proof, its been said many times by other cbs and trollers over different days


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she answered as "dogs" and said "yes" to me asking if we ever have her answer security questions lol


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
hm


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
okay that's interesting


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so there are two red flags we're sitting with here


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
she also change her name from maragret thingy back to south and then to eggsaremanky within the span of like 30 minutes


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
I just find it odd that she didn't message anyone through her discord


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
roblox**


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] emma;#1525
like to alert us


[26-Jan-20 09:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah true


[26-Jan-20 09:54 PM] bman#0435
i find it odd how she wanted attention for people to think she was a new mr


[26-Jan-20 09:54 PM] bman#0435
because i dont think she would know that her doing that couldve gotten us a lot of hate and trouble


[26-Jan-20 09:54 PM] bman#0435
considering it was "someone that no one has ever seen"


[26-Jan-20 09:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
part of me thinks she did that, tried to play off the alex thing like it's nothing, or trying to pretend she's not a CB


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
i assumed she did it because she felt popular with all the pings she got as a new mr, probably got forgotten, and wanted to relive that moment


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
for the last thing about her being a CB, we don't really have any evidence at the moment to support this


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i highly doubt it @bman


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
then why would she say she is a new mr


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
lol


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe as some kind of really bad joke who knows


[26-Jan-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but then again


[26-Jan-20 09:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
CBs usually thrive off attention so this should be quite interesting


[26-Jan-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm thinking of not responding after the three messages she sent me, no idea


[26-Jan-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[26-Jan-20 09:57 PM] emma;#1525
trey literally just say "Since you believe we asked you security questions (which is not true) we have no choice but to believe you are hacked and so you will remain suspended indefinitely."


[26-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
and then see what she says


[26-Jan-20 09:58 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[26-Jan-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[26-Jan-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i can definitely go with that


[26-Jan-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
for a second i was thinking of doing it tomorrow since im in a shitty mood, but it doesn't hurt to do so for today

@High Rank Regarding Slee_20 recording a voice chat, some of us have agreed with at least a five day suspension. Do you agree with this? If not, please provide your reasoning.

See he might not know that

That‚Äôs why I say tell him it is and warn him

If he didn‚Äôt know it was....kinda unfair not everyone knows it is

That‚Äôs a bit much for something he wasn‚Äôt aware of


[27-Jan-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
a report of someone saying something in a vc


[27-Jan-20 03:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Now he‚Äôs aware of it


[27-Jan-20 03:29 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
not sure if hes not aware of it yet


[27-Jan-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
are you sure he did not just accidentally include the vc part?


[27-Jan-20 03:29 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
waiting for bman to ask him if he was aware its illegal

or someone else can ask if u want


[27-Jan-20 03:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We don‚Äôt have an explicit ruling stating that


[27-Jan-20 03:30 PM] Polk#1596
to be honest he mightve not even rewatched the video so he didnt notice the audio


[27-Jan-20 03:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Definitely need to warn him first instead of jumping to a suspension

am i asking him


[27-Jan-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
I really think he didn‚Äôt know it was illegal....exact reason why I say it‚Äôs not fair to just straight up suspend him for something he didn‚Äôt know was illegal.


[27-Jan-20 03:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Polky I think the purpose was to record it lol

he was recording someone at the hotel with the vc in the background


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Polk did you know what the report was about lol


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] bman#0435
no ok


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
no im confused now


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
i thought the audio was just in the background


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
The kid on the VC was staff and admitted to being a troller with an inappropriate username


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] bman#0435
he was reporting about a staff going on an alt to troll any bypass


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] bman#0435
and used the vc admitting


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] bman#0435
to it


[27-Jan-20 03:31 PM] stacey#1000
If y‚Äôall really wanna suspend him for something he didn‚Äôt know was illegal, your call but you know my opinion now.

Yes we should make him aware of it being illegal

am i just straight up asking if he knew it was illegal

ye


[27-Jan-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596

[27-Jan-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
he is a former HR, he should know better

Just say we know your intentions were good but it is illegal to record someone without their permission

Exactly...no one even knew it‚Äôs a rule

Hi Slee!

So it's come to my attention that the video you used as evidence against the staff included a VC, and you were fully aware of it, correct?


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
then ill say


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
You do know that recording a voice-chat is illegal, right?

[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
or sum


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
IDK


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
ya


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
we did


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
Well....


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435

[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
I agree with Ramm


[27-Jan-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
ik hers was worse


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
but she still broke a law too


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
didnt cookies get fired for breaking a law


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
Huh


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] Polk#1596
but if i was in slees position and i wasnt aware of that rule i would definitely feel like a warning would be more fair


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
No cookies was fired for fake being hacked


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
honestly, we may need to make an announcement about recording voicechats


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
plus


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
no


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] Polk#1596
mhm


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
cookies just said a bad word then lied abt getting hacked


[27-Jan-20 03:35 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
if you all remember about the situation where people made accusations about darren recording voicechats


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
maybe warn him then make an announcement about it first


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
many people made it aware that it was illegal in general


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
That was a long time ago. Tho


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
because then we cant have people go "i never knew about this rule, why am i getting a suspension?"


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
so they have no excuses for doing it in the future


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
We got a lot of new people now


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] bman#0435
there was no proof of darren recording tho


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
true


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] bman#0435
but we have proof of slee recording


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
And not even everyone knew about it


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
ik im not blaming darren im just saying that a lot of people were made aware that it was illegal at that time


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
But he likely didn‚Äôt know it was illegal...


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
plus they were saying that to make fun of darren


[27-Jan-20 03:36 PM] bman#0435
wasnt slee an hr at the time of that rumor going around


[27-Jan-20 03:37 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666

for evidence

Against what

[27-Jan-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Jan-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
I looked this up a long time ago


[27-Jan-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
There‚Äôs only a few states where it‚Äôs illegal but we‚Äôre technically an international server


[27-Jan-20 04:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Harriet is getting too much attention. 547 (now 548) mentioning her name in this chat!!

Took 2 seconds to find proof


[27-Jan-20 04:23 PM] bman#0435
well if its the one person needs to consent then we should find out who in that vc said he could record


[27-Jan-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
Slee can consent to it


[27-Jan-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
As long as he was in the VC


[27-Jan-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
Y‚Äôall need to learn to research things before branding them as illegal


[27-Jan-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
This is why we had Ryan


[27-Jan-20 04:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Everyone says it's illegal


[27-Jan-20 04:25 PM] bman#0435
pretty sure that law is saying he needs 1 other persons consent because it wouldnt be a law if the recorder is that one person giving the consent


[27-Jan-20 04:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Just a rumour I guess


[27-Jan-20 04:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
I suggest doing an announcement


[27-Jan-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs not illegal


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
I posted proof


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
@bman did you read what i sent


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] bman#0435
ya u said slee can consent since he was in the vc


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] bman#0435
but that makes no sense


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] bman#0435
he was the one recording


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
Can I ping here in the bloxton chat to say hi


[27-Jan-20 04:26 PM] bman#0435
how can the one recording consent to their own recording


[27-Jan-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
‚ÄúYou can record a phone call or conversation as long as you are a party to the conversation‚Äù


[27-Jan-20 04:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bonnie591 yes let's do it


[27-Jan-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525

@xM_inn


[27-Jan-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
Means as long as you are participating in the VC then you can record

[27-Jan-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
The law is meant to protect against bugging calls


[27-Jan-20 04:29 PM] bman#0435
he was in it but didnt even speak


[27-Jan-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
The law wasn‚Äôt made around discord Bman


[27-Jan-20 04:29 PM] bman#0435
so he technically didn't "participate in the VC"


[27-Jan-20 04:29 PM] bman#0435

[27-Jan-20 06:24 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
Greetings, Ra1nbow_ss.

I am here to inform you that we have noticed some unnecessary/harmful behavior being displayed by you in staff-lounge. We have made an announcement before regarding behavior in staff-lounge, by making sure our MRs don't cross the line when it comes to joking. What I'm trying to say is, please be more cautious of what you say when speaking to others. It may affect them more than what it seems. We do understand you were only joking, but sometimes even a joke can hurt someone deeply. Please take this as a reminder/warning to improve on your behavior. We hope to see you excel and grow from this mistake.

Best regards,

_blissuh_

Sure, should I just tell her that you're con-


[28-Jan-20 12:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Disregard that.


[28-Jan-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
just ask her why did she straight-up lie about the security question things


[28-Jan-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
and we can go from there


[28-Jan-20 12:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh yeah just a reminder


[28-Jan-20 12:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she had "not koreahn" before in her discord tag @xM_inn


[28-Jan-20 12:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm tempted to see how she answers


[28-Jan-20 12:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i asked her why she put that too


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh, she did?


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yep


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i saw it too


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
did she change it to that after suspension or before?


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
after


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
bruh


[28-Jan-20 12:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
shes literally making things much harder and suspicious


[28-Jan-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we cant get to the bottom of why shes acting like this then id consider a demotion to LR due to being a security risk and lying during an active invesitgation

[28-Jan-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
so he technically searched up ‚Äúcancer‚Äù in the bloxton server to find negative stuff to report because of whats happenign to him?


[28-Jan-20 09:14 PM] bman#0435
i feel bad for slee and hope his grandpa gets well, but reporting an mr for saying a ‚Äúcancer‚Äù joke from nearly a month ago wasnt a good way to bring up his personal life/situation

the bot sometimes puts one ticket at the top

[30-Jan-20 06:46 PM] bman#0435
we might need to remind hadley how to work trello because she keeps making new cards for cards she already made


[30-Jan-20 06:49 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Jan-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
managers have been noticing it a lot


[30-Jan-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
she would make one card for a player


[30-Jan-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
and later make another card for the same person


[30-Jan-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435

[30-Jan-20 06:55 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank would y'all be okay with me making an "MR Memories" or something channel? Basically it would be like photo gallery and vintage photos except it would be an MR only channel that they could put any funny pics in. That way we (or i) can  stop flooding the pins of staff lounge with them lol. Rules would be that photos have to follow sl rules (minor cursing fine, nothing offensive, inappropriate, etc and would have to be from roblox)

"hoes mad" is how you vote for no


[30-Jan-20 09:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
sure but what if they like post every second of their lives on there


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Aka flood it


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
With everything they do


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] emma;#1525
i mean honestly as long as they aren't spamming i wont care until they complain


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] emma;#1525
they're flooding sl already


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] emma;#1525
i'd rather they flood a diff channel lol


[30-Jan-20 09:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I guess


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But I think there should be like


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Slow mode maybe


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So thye can‚Äôt like put 5 million pictures at the same time


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
slowmode doesn't work when you're uploading 10 photos at a time


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So that other people‚Äôs pictures can be seen


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but what if they do one at a time


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
unless they're posting individually


[30-Jan-20 09:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[30-Jan-20 09:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what if we set a limit to how many u can send at once


[30-Jan-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
i mean we can make a rule of "only post your FAVORITE funny things here, if we see people flooding it with random photos we'll delete the channel"


[30-Jan-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
or like a "post once a day max" thing


[30-Jan-20 09:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[30-Jan-20 09:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc I think like it needs to have some sort of ‚Äústructure‚Äù so that everyone can have a chance for their picture to be seen


[30-Jan-20 09:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think once or twice a day is good


[30-Jan-20 09:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok ima sleep now byeee <:

[31-Jan-20 03:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
hi


[31-Jan-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Jan-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
we're gonna have to get him a system like jack does


[31-Jan-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
did*


[31-Jan-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
What system was that


[31-Jan-20 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
@emma;


[31-Jan-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
i dont remember exactly what it was


[31-Jan-20 03:47 PM] emma;#1525
but jack had to like add a label to ones he was going to rank


[31-Jan-20 03:47 PM] emma;#1525
and then had to rank them by a certain time


[31-Jan-20 03:47 PM] emma;#1525
pretty sure i ranked his passers once and he got mad at me lol


[31-Jan-20 03:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ranked ur passers @xM_inn


[31-Jan-20 03:58 PM] emma;#1525
we need a rule of if you dont rank your passers within 24 hours more than 3 times in a row, you cant host for a week!!!


[31-Jan-20 03:58 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[31-Jan-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
I agree with that


[31-Jan-20 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
speaking of which I want to rank my passers from last night as its almost 24 hours but uh


[31-Jan-20 03:59 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
emma is just salty cuz everyone keeps planning sessions a few days in advance.. smh!


[31-Jan-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[31-Jan-20 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
legit trello just takes years to load!!!


[31-Jan-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
why does it hate me


[31-Jan-20 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
ok wow it works on my phone but that doesnt help me with copy and pasting the usernames


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] Polk#1596
btw, does anyone else say no to the laser game things, or is it just me?


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
i dont do it often


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
tbh


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] bman#0435
i do it unless i dont have time to


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] bman#0435
but i might not


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
Ive done it 2 times and now


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] Polk#1596
i keep on getting asked to host it after every session, but i say no


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] bman#0435
since emma isnt even counting points anymore


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] bman#0435
üôÑ


[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] Polk#1596

[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] Polk#1596

[31-Jan-20 04:02 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] bman#0435

[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] Polk#1596
i dont give permission to the seniors either


[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] Polk#1596
@bman read her most recent announcement


[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] Polk#1596
im pretty sure she talked about it


[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] Polk#1596

[31-Jan-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000

Emma_ii01/21/2020
Hello everyone, I am very busy with school and haven‚Äôt had time to update the laser gun leaderboard in a while and probably won‚Äôt for a few more days.


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
i got pissed off cause i was already in a bad mood with a bad migrane and almost cancelled my trainings


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] bman#0435
literally has been 10 days\


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
can we make a rule not to complain about no laser tag


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] bman#0435
or we can just end it lmao


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] Polk#1596
its probably a fun game and all, but im not a big fan of admin abuse even though its just for fun


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
yeah that too


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] bman#0435
we shouldnt make a rule for an unofficial thing


[31-Jan-20 04:04 PM] Polk#1596
stacey


[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
im writing an announcement about it rn


[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
i can add that to my announcement as well


[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
yeah add like


[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
no complaining about no laser tag if a host decides to shutdown and not do it


[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
or if a host says no


[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[31-Jan-20 04:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[31-Jan-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596

[31-Jan-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596

[31-Jan-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596

[31-Jan-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
they just straight up complained


[31-Jan-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
when i shutdown and didnt do lasertag


[31-Jan-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
i guess it was a bigger problem than i thought o_o


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
ok i'll yell at them for doing that


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
aW nO lAsEr TaG


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
well why are they complaining when a server shutsdown


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
i never responded to them either


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
cause I was in a bad mood last night


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
its better not to


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
i wouldve ended up saying something i regretted


[31-Jan-20 04:07 PM] bman#0435
ya and it lowkey gets annoying when tate plays lmao


[31-Jan-20 04:08 PM] bman#0435
whenever he loses he calls me salty and a cheater


[31-Jan-20 04:08 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[31-Jan-20 04:08 PM] bman#0435
then others start saying it


[31-Jan-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i just say "fuck u" to you when i lose @bman


[31-Jan-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
i legit was like ok ill start this training and get a manager to send me passers


[31-Jan-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm just gonna stop doing that


[31-Jan-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
well at least i can rank 2 passers! the ones the manager DMed me and wait for trello to like me again!!


[31-Jan-20 04:13 PM] Polk#1596
i'll add that too @bman


[31-Jan-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
@bman it's never been a requirement for y'all to do, I just started it as a fun thing for MRs to do


[31-Jan-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
keeping points wasn't my original goal, I did it bc I didn't realize how often it would be hosted


[31-Jan-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
If you guys don't want to host it you don't have to lol I'm not even hosting regular sessions so idc if it dies out


[31-Jan-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk if ur making an announcement about it can i see it first


[31-Jan-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
or i can announce it if you want lol i agree people shouldn't be complaining since it's an optional thing


[31-Jan-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
honestly we can just stop keeping track of points altogether and that would prob make people stop complaining since there's no "benefits" to winning


[31-Jan-20 04:36 PM] Polk#1596
i already made it in polks epic format


[31-Jan-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
and if it dies out eventually that's fine


[31-Jan-20 04:36 PM] Polk#1596
im bored so i made it the same way like the themed session

__**POLK'S SESSIONS:**__

> Greetings, everyone!
> 
> As I keep on getting questions about if I can host the laser game thing or give permission to a Senior Management so they can host it, I thought I should just announce it here instead of saying no every time someone asks. Sadly, I do **not** allow the laser game thing after my sessions, so there is no point in asking me for permission. However, several other HRs do allow it, so don't worry!

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

__**IMPORTANT REMINDER:**__

> Yes, we know. Most of you guys love playing the laser game, but sometimes, we simply do not have time to host it. Although you may really want to play it, please do not complain or beg an HR to host it they have chosen not to. It gets annoying when you guys keep complaining about it as if it is something we are required to do. The laser gun game is simply a game Emma made for fun that we occasionally host, not something actually related to the session. You may ask the HR if they will host it, but if they say no, please accept that response.
> 
> Additionally, I need to remind you guys to behave appropriately during these games. Although there won't be any LRs around, you must still be respectful to your co-workers. This means you must refrain from calling others rude things like a loser, etc. Keep in mind that this is just a friendly game! (You can still joke around, but keep it to a respectful limit.)

@High Rank xLuvcas might have lead himself in some trouble lately. I've received some screenshots of 2 separate incidents of him being pretty much information. Have your own judgement for these and express your opinion of the matter. Let the posting begin.

[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
they also seem to be at fault e.e


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] ethan;#0003
seems like annika was baiting him


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
^


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
especially with the last one


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
that was all her


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
lmao


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Actually, the first two screenshots were not exactly her.


[31-Jan-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
ethan said **seems**


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
and i said **the last one**


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know, I'm just resp-


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
we didnt say all of them were


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Now, the question is, what now?


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs enough for a termination. Maybe a warning


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This can't really be a warning given that:


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[31-Jan-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[31-Jan-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) He's a Management, I think he's aware that he could do better on this.


[31-Jan-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) He did bypass in a private server, and we've suspended a person based off of this before.


[31-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm going to blunt here, I think he deserves a 3 day suspension.


[31-Jan-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
id go with like a 3-4 day suspension since only the first 2 were valid evidence


[31-Jan-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
unless theres more evidence, im sticking to that


[31-Jan-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was clean, they were from a private server.


[31-Jan-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
As for the rest, I'm going to agree with you guys.

[31-Jan-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
Y‚Äôall want to suspend him


[31-Jan-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
FOR THAT???


[31-Jan-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
TF is wrong with you people


[31-Jan-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey You better not


[31-Jan-20 07:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
why do you disagree?


[31-Jan-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
We don‚Äôt suspend for things not related to Bloxton lmao and none of these are and none of these are serious enough to ignore that rule


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] bman#0435
so bypassing in a private server isnt a suspension?


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
He did this in a bloxton private server..

Dude we bypass at stapleton all the time


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
I see MRs bypass everywhere


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs a roblox problem


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
**Bloxton** private server

[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
We‚Äôre there only MRs on?


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
We suspended an MR for bypassing in a private server a while ago


[31-Jan-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
If it‚Äôs the ps I was on earlier it was only MRs


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt remember suspending an MR for that but I doubt it would be something I supported


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] emma;#1525
Since when were you all against warnings and letting people change before punishing as a first bet


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
we did


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
they bypassed using m


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] emma;#1525
Why do we have to go to the extreme on the first round for things like this when it could be corrected with a warning


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] emma;#1525
He also didn‚Äôt bypass...?


[31-Jan-20 07:21 PM] emma;#1525
It was inappropriate yes


[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
obviously it wasnt the "first round" for thing


[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
k emma try saying "i snorted crack" in a ps


[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
But ‚Äúpp in da bum bum‚Äù isn‚Äôt bypassing


[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
he bypassed by no saying the r

[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
Ok but that‚Äôs actually bypassing


[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
and try saying that second one without changing up words and lettering


[31-Jan-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
Also how long was Armani suspended for


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
If y‚Äôall are dead set on a suspensioj that‚Äôs out of my hands but it better not be 5 fucking days for that


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
what lucas said and what armani said are totally differant things


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
Y‚Äôall be out here ruining people‚Äôs careers for no reason


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
5 days


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] bman#0435
can u read, it obvioisly said 3 days


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
Uh he chose to bypass


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
I agree with suspending lucas, but what he bypassed is totally differant from what armani bypassed


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
I still think 3 is not the move


[31-Jan-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
You can‚Äôt compare Armani and Lucas lol


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ik but bypassing or being inappropriate is the same thing; violation of roblox tos


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] bman#0435
and hwo is it "ruining people's careers" when first off its a suspension and secondly bypassed on his own


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
Armani bypassed a curse word using x's and extra letters, lucas just flat out said the word


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
You can't blame us for "ruining his career" he should know better


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
And the way lucas said it, he wasn't going around the chat filter


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
So ‚Äúbypassing‚Äù on a PS with only MRs is better than bypassing on a non Bloxton game with LRs around


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
because he didnt use any other letters


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt give people chances


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
like how armani said it


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] bman#0435
he bypassed in a bloxton ps


[31-Jan-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
You go straight for a punishment


[31-Jan-20 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
:boi:


[31-Jan-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
Did you not read what I said Bman


[31-Jan-20 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; now you know ho I feel when you ignore everything I say


[31-Jan-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
I meant worse oops


[31-Jan-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; I don‚Äôt ignore what you say lol I just rarely agree with you and you don‚Äôt listen to me


[31-Jan-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
I selectively don‚Äôt respond sometimes


[31-Jan-20 07:26 PM] emma;#1525
Y‚Äôall forget how most of these people are kids much younger than us, idk why they are all treated like they have malicious intent with everything when it‚Äôs clearly kids being dumb


[31-Jan-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
One dm to Lucas saying ‚Äúcut it out‚Äù will most likely have the same effect as a suspension ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[31-Jan-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
But no ones willing to give him that chance but me and Ethan apparently


[31-Jan-20 07:27 PM] bman#0435
ethan literally said he agreed with suspending him tho


[31-Jan-20 07:27 PM] bman#0435
so


[31-Jan-20 07:27 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] ethan;#0003
But I think 5 days is excess


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
we didnt say 5 days


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
we said 3


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] ethan;#0003
o


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] ethan;#0003
I thought Minn said 5.


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well we voted on a suspension as a team so if you wanna overrule then revote, but otherwise we're going ahead with a 3 day suspension


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
that was armanis


[31-Jan-20 07:28 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk where I saw 5 days


[31-Jan-20 07:29 PM] bman#0435
also @ethan; wut does being suspended within the past 3 months do


[31-Jan-20 07:29 PM] bman#0435
like does it mean they cant get promoted


[31-Jan-20 07:29 PM] bman#0435
or were u just saying it for awareness


[31-Jan-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn can we suspend you for not ranking passers lol


[31-Jan-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
While we‚Äôre al yelling at each other


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000

trello is working for me


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I ranked them, not Minn.


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not working for me


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] emma;#1525

I think it‚Äôs my internet


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Listen Minn, I like you, but you have to be better at these.


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm using data rn on phone


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; no i leave my passers for HRs to get free admin acts with


[31-Jan-20 07:30 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs not the point of those-


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not a good idea.


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey shut up we dont need no jack in here


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
Dude no one sees that as a favor you‚Äôre doing


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
It looks like you‚Äôre being lazy


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman, please.


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
It took 3 days for your passers to be ranked


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] bman#0435
trey please


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No like, I'm actually being deadass.


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
Can someone rank my passers my internet hates me rn


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I will.


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] bman#0435
i got u-


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] bman#0435
i dont got u


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs not our job to rank other people‚Äôs passers and we have more pressing admin acts (like BANS) that we need to be doing


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
Unless Trello sucks for you like Stacey‚Äôs lol


[31-Jan-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
Then it‚Äôs fine


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
be careful emma, he can change it to that üëÄ


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôd rather do bans than passers


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
Bc that‚Äôs actually my job and important


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thing is, there are other ways to specifically earn that besides ranking.


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
make emma a requirement to rank min passers


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
If we have an overflow of bans I'll increase the admin act requirement


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
If we‚Äôre all spending our required admin acts on minn‚Äôs passers then no one will do band or suspensions or anything


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
bans


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
But the whole point of GMs having the ban session requirement is to prevent that


[31-Jan-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
thats what we have @PackItUpMack for üòå


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
the ban god


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Gonna side with Emma here, I don't think it's that fair for users to wait that long for them to get started with their position.


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
Okay but the point is that you shouldn‚Äôt be leaving your passers up for 72 hours


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs literally not okay


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
Idc if you justify it by saying we benefit from it


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
We don‚Äôt benefit by being spammed by your passers


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oop we had the same point @emma;


[31-Jan-20 07:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

my blood is gonna be in someone else‚Äôs body


[31-Jan-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
Then rank your passers and you won‚Äôt get a lecture...?


[31-Jan-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
We‚Äôve been dealing with this for weeks so you can deal with it for 5 mins


[31-Jan-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well, I'm sorry about that. But you have to step-up here, you're a BoD.

Last time I checked it wasn't your responsibility to lecture me but ok

Don‚Äôt host if you aren‚Äôt planning on ranking


[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have my own ranking issues, but I'd never do 72 hours.


[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly.

[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then don't host.


[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
You‚Äôre on stapleton a lot


[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
Wait 10 minutes and rank passers before going on stapleton


[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
Problem solved


[31-Jan-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
I usually rank the very next day not past 24 hours or right after the session.


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Jack faced that problem, and I don't want you to suffer the same thing.


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] bman#0435
i thought u got warned or suspended if it was over 24 hours-


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
No


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We never did much with it, Bman.


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
Make it a habit to rank right after a session if you can


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah if you‚Äôre not a BOD I guess bc jack got in huge trouble


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The regulation was not in-place.


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
To get it done and over with.


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
And had a system created for him


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
Bc he was always late

1/95324234 HEAD RECEPS IN THE SERVER


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
I mean y‚Äôall had to intervene


[31-Jan-20 07:36 PM] bman#0435
AND HED ADJUST BY 5 MINUTES


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
THEN 10


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
THEN 30


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôd call that a problem


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Mk when? @xAfroTrey


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He was suspended, Minn.


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
THEN AN HOUR


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
AND I WAS LIKE


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
I MAY AS WELL LEAVE


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
That was for leaving his session abandoned Trey..


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
Well his suspension was bc he left trainings for two hours lol


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Big difference.


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
But he still got in trouble for not ranking


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And this is a difference how?


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
Hence the SYSTEM


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
that you guys all created for him


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Because abandoning a session and not ranking passers are two entirely different thing.


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
Minn we can stop talking about this if you agree to rank within 24 hours like the rest of us lol


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
We don‚Äôt need those admin acts


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
We didn't create crap for him, he made that on his own. It was for his own Trello board where he logged his passers.


[31-Jan-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
THAT badly


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
wait ok im sorry y did jack get suspended fgor leaving a server when a manager couldve taken care of it


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, but like Emma pointed out, that's still rank inconsistency.


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There was none, Bman.


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
o


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
y didnt he ask someone to take over0


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
managers aren‚Äôt supposed to take care for 2 hours


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
üòÇ


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
He left without warning


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
emma be missin my point


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
And didn‚Äôt tell anyone why


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
So


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
o


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
He disappeared from the server for two hours without any notice or anything @bman


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
who tf would stay ther for 2 hours


[31-Jan-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I had around 10+ DMs of the issue.


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
He legit started the server and didn‚Äôt release trainees or anything and yeah


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
I watched YouTube


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
And it wasn‚Äôt 2 hours


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
It was an hour


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

everyone thought he was a good role model üíÄ


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
He did rules


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] emma;#1525
okay can we all just agree that we need to rank within 24 hours (as is promised by ALL MRs when they train or kick) and if someone else wants to rank early for admin acts whatever but if they aren‚Äôt ranked within 24 hours we get to shame you


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
Trey you came


[31-Jan-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
And thought they passed


[31-Jan-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
And then you were told they hadn‚Äôt even trained yet


[31-Jan-20 07:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait is there an actual video on this lol


[31-Jan-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
So you released them


[31-Jan-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000

Dear dianIyn,

You have been temporarily suspended due to suspicions of you account-sharing with another person. Over the course of your suspension, the HR team will be asking you a variety of questions. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask them. Thank you for your time.

[31-Jan-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
Well...


[31-Jan-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
If she gave the account away before she joined Bloxton then technically only one person has been on it during Bloxton


[31-Jan-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
So...


[31-Jan-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
Not the kind of account sharing we were thinking ....?


[31-Jan-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[31-Jan-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
Just someone gave account away before they even joined Bloxton so


[31-Jan-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think we can do anything about that unless it‚Äôs 2 people in the account rn


[31-Jan-20 10:21 PM] bman#0435
@stacey ranked ur passers btw


[31-Jan-20 10:21 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jan-20 11:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think she meant this with bad intentions here, I think this could've escalated a lot worse.


[31-Jan-20 11:17 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
true


[31-Jan-20 11:17 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
she was most likely talking to one of her friends tbh


[31-Jan-20 11:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If I'm being fairly honest, I'd stick with a warning.


[31-Jan-20 11:21 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
