[03-Jun-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
when someone reports an MR with old evidence and majority of the evidence is just them hinting bruh im so done with people reporting things last minute. evidence from 2020 and then back in march and april of this year


[03-Jun-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
like cant do anything to help you with evidence that old


[03-Jun-21 05:39 PM] katie#0200
I feel like MTH‚Äôs appeal was short/lacking detail considering what he was banned for


[03-Jun-21 05:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah i agree


[03-Jun-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
is there a specific reason for the appeal number 3 being declined, like is it too early for such a major offence?


[03-Jun-21 05:43 PM] cory!#8287
I‚Äôve seen that mth dude appeal like 5 times and I‚Äôve declined every single one of their appeals for lack of detail so I honestly don‚Äôt think they understand what ‚Äúadd more detail‚Äù means lmao üò≠


[03-Jun-21 05:44 PM] cory!#8287
I think urisco should add more detail since he was a cb tbh

@Bloo_Berriez  if Connor is trying to appeal for the former MR role that‚Äôs the most lack of detail appeal for it I‚Äôve ever seen tbh. It‚Äôs only 1 sentence and no apology so that‚Äôs why I voted no


[03-Jun-21 06:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well he never got it taken away. i dont think he's had it since he's been terminated why would he need to appeal


[03-Jun-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
I thought it was removed


[03-Jun-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Cause after he got fired


[03-Jun-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
He got fired didn‚Äôt he


[03-Jun-21 06:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
was it? i dont remember


[03-Jun-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Then after


[03-Jun-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
He was acting with an attitude


[03-Jun-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôm pretty sure it was taken away or he got kicked from the discord so he would have to appeal for it


[03-Jun-21 06:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@Bloo_Berriez what's connors id?


[03-Jun-21 06:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
201814361130532875


[03-Jun-21 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
I know he was for sure terminated


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
he was terminated


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I remember


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it was the Lee, Jack, Connor, Mirk thing


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he said he's never had it


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
He was appealed.


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I don't know if he got it.


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but he was kicked from the server for maxed warnings


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
by JJJ


[03-Jun-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[03-Jun-21 06:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but that ban was around when he was terminated because the day before he ban his MR ranks got removed


[03-Jun-21 06:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and he got banned because im pretty sure he told flyro about the situation.


[03-Jun-21 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
So he should have to appeal again then


[03-Jun-21 06:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i'll have him send in an appeal for it and get back to you guys


[03-Jun-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
Sounds good


[03-Jun-21 06:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Now, out of all the 27 role given dyno messages about him..I see no former role given..but i do have a tendency to overlook things

@emily they couldve been less hostile with that appeal... üòü

my thoughts exactly


[06-Jun-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
That whole appeal seems like they are mad at Bloxton and want to come back and start even more drama. It makes me want to perm deny instead of appeal with no chances to appeal


[06-Jun-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
The note made it worse


[06-Jun-21 05:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah that‚Äôs why I was like nope


[06-Jun-21 05:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The note could of been left in the drafts or the üóë. It just shows they still mad.


[06-Jun-21 05:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But good thing they did type the note


[06-Jun-21 05:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Because we know their current feelings about their consequences


[06-Jun-21 05:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Instead of possible getting by and back to starting drama


[06-Jun-21 06:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
Great appeal!!


[07-Jun-21 10:40 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 do I have to put rank 1 on this so the bot fires her after suspension or do I just do it before the bot. https://trello.com/c/aukmT6N9


[07-Jun-21 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
Cause the bot tried re-ranking and she left again so if she does it again trying to get a job she might just get blacklisted or just fired again


[07-Jun-21 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
You'll need to manually rank once the suspension is over, but you'll need to put rank 1 in the card to prevent it from ranking her back to 6


[07-Jun-21 10:57 AM] stacey#1000
Ok

[07-Jun-21 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
Bruh isabellarose1979 rejoined a 3rd time and got a staff rank during a suspension. I will give her one last chance and if she does it again she gets a blacklist because she is clearly not learning. Now I have to ask seniors not to rank her because that‚Äôs how she‚Äôs getting the rank. Fun.


[07-Jun-21 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 am I allowed to ban her from interview and trainings for like 3 days so she can‚Äôt get a job and rejoin again or just blacklist or something if she does again for like the 5th time


[07-Jun-21 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
Ik we only ban for like major things but I think we should be allowed to temp ban those that rejoin to try to get a job to avoid a suspension


[07-Jun-21 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
If she's rejoined for a 3rd time then blacklist. Only ban from the tc and ic though


[07-Jun-21 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah  it‚Äôs been 3 times now but I was feeling nice and am giving her 1 last final chance and told seniors to not rank her cause that‚Äôs how she keeps getting a job again


[07-Jun-21 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
She will do it again tomorrow I bet but now seniors are aware to Dm me and not rank her


[07-Jun-21 07:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
Alr


[07-Jun-21 07:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
reminds me of the time this person got suspended and made a big deal about in my dms..said they were just gonna rejoin and I said "You'll just be reranked!" and they'll said they'll just keep doing it over and over again..then later comes to find out..they've been messaging all the seniors trying to get their suspended rank back instead of coming back and asking me


[07-Jun-21 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
People that rejoin and can‚Äôt accept a 3 day suspension annoy me.


[07-Jun-21 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
But it happens a lot sadly


[07-Jun-21 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
Rip did they get blacklisted or did they learn and accept suspension


[07-Jun-21 08:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ig they learn to accept it because the seniors was talking about it lol and i told them to tell the person to contact me


[07-Jun-21 08:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
didnt hear back from them after i ranked them tho


[07-Jun-21 09:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@Beartikal Is there something wrong with the talkative reaction? I've gotten two people say they're not getting the talkative role but they met the requirements. I clicked on it myself and did not get the talkative role (Don't know if that would work as a test.)


[07-Jun-21 09:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And the last time the Bot gave talkative role to someone was "Last Saturday" which I figure is the last the 5th of this month.

@bonnie591 is it possible to change permissions for seniors to allow them to tag the management role and head role so when they need mrs or managers they can tag them and ask or is it not possible with the discord admin system?


[10-Jun-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
armani says they can in manager discussion but for interviews they cant tag in staff discussion


[10-Jun-21 05:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya sure but they should only do it if its **really necessary.** E.G there's loads of trainees and no managers. As for heads, I don't see it being necessary at all since lrs can train. If interviews is desperate for Mrs especially when training and interviews are occurring at the same time.


[10-Jun-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
interviews its only done when they have like 1-2 mrs with a bunch of interviewees which is the case for most of secondary servers


[10-Jun-21 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
im just thinking because recently at my sessions at least ive had to tag for managers for them almost every session because they would have 0 with a fair amount of trainees


[10-Jun-21 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
and interviews just had to today again cause armani only had 2 interviewees


[10-Jun-21 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
but if they had perms to tag on their own they could tag as well


[10-Jun-21 05:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure but pinging has to be kept to a minimum, if it begins to happen most sessions then we'll have to remove perms since it'll get very annoying for the Mrs. It should be only done if absolutely necessary and if other servers doesn't have any Mrs to share. Like for example the host server usually only has like 4 trainees and usually has 4 managers. If another training server has 10 trainees and 0 managers then 2 should hop from server 1.

For interviews pinging will probably be more frequent but efforts should be made to try and distribute the Mrs before pinging by asking the ones in the main to hop


[10-Jun-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
Im not sure what other training sessions are like but since its going into summer I think its busier because at my sessions this week so far and last week I have had 7+ trainees for pretty much every server with no managers to spare so I tag for them a lot. Interviews is not as bad its mostly managers for trainings rn


[10-Jun-21 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
We don't have to give them permission to tag but do you want to do like a trial to see how it goes or if its even needed


[10-Jun-21 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
Just an idea but we don't have to do it at all either since HRs can also tag if needed.


[10-Jun-21 05:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can try it out. Hopefully managers return from their finals and stuff. We should try not to let manager become larger than head so we gotta be careful with it. We could have a manager vote soon tho to hire 2 more since that's affordable to do rn


[10-Jun-21 05:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll update perms tomorrow

@High Rank I've added 6 LRs to the promotion opinions list! Each card has a detailed list on their activity and why I think they should be promoted. Please vote on them if you're available. At the time of this message, 4 are unclaimed so feel free to claim if you want. Just be aware xSal_ty is in an Australian timezone so it might not be wise for EST or CST to take it unless you stay up really late or wake up really early!

[11-Jun-21 05:55 PM] ethan;#0003
she got the welcome to bloxton badge after the gucci items...


[11-Jun-21 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003
the welcome to bloxton badge is on her second page


[11-Jun-21 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003
i think its an alt account


[11-Jun-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
@ethan; they have 100 bloxton bucks after their welcome badge


[11-Jun-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
so


[11-Jun-21 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[11-Jun-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
they might of deleted it for some reason


[11-Jun-21 06:03 PM] ethan;#0003
they deleted it then


[11-Jun-21 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt talk in staff lounge ever or very rarely. It‚Äôs always leaked and I trust 0 heads.

YAY


[13-Jun-21 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
We should probs do an announcement to the Mrs telling them to auto kick the leaker as soon as they leak something and then dm get them server banned / perm banned ASAP by a senior/hr


[13-Jun-21 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since rn they aren't being added to ban requests and they aren't kicked straight away

[13-Jun-21 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
can we suspend epir or whatever her name is for questioning


[13-Jun-21 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
imag made a good point out of it


[13-Jun-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
and they are bst or they are making up the time to throw us off idk


[13-Jun-21 04:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hmm let's do the announcement first and see what happens and if we get more evidence regarding it

[13-Jun-21 05:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's probabaly her as she goes afk in game whenever the leaker is at the hotel


[13-Jun-21 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
U can suspend and question if u want as she's our prime suspect rn


[13-Jun-21 05:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can observe more as well

@katie HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY!! :D


[13-Jun-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
shes never really on when I am for questioning as Im never on till later EST when shes offline so its probably better someone with a similar timezone questions her tbh


[13-Jun-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
@katie HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!


[13-Jun-21 07:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
The leaker was active at 5am bst


[13-Jun-21 07:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
So if she isn't online then it might not be her


[13-Jun-21 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
I never see her


[13-Jun-21 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
its probably best someone BST or someone thats on earlier EST questions


[13-Jun-21 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
or to just randomly test something when the leaker is at the hotel next time. randomly take all her roles and see if the leaking suddenly stops. if so its her

[14-Jun-21 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
I disagree on the fire part


[14-Jun-21 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
They should just be restricted until they are old enough


[14-Jun-21 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
Well if it's like an account age of 1 for example


[14-Jun-21 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
thats an obvious alt account


[14-Jun-21 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
that is going to get a job to abuse


[14-Jun-21 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
if they wouldnt pass interviews why allow them to pass applications then trainings


[14-Jun-21 04:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
If they havent played any other game and only have the bloxton badge or whatever then yeah but


[14-Jun-21 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I just fired one that had an acc age of 1 and was an obv alt acc to abuse


[14-Jun-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
if we dont fire can we at least make it mandetory they do an acc age check there


[14-Jun-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
cause i dont think they are doing it at trainings


[14-Jun-21 04:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya an age check is fine but we should only fire if it's an obvious alt


[14-Jun-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
here is an example of the one i fired https://www.roblox.com/users/2647193586/profile

It‚Äôs kind of suspicious he got blacklisted from something, maybe firestone?


[17-Jun-21 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
But not sure what for so


[17-Jun-21 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
Not sure what we can do about it though. Maybe warn? Termination seems too strict and same with a suspension but if he was warned before then maybe suspend


[17-Jun-21 02:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Polk @xM_inn did lava get blacklisted from anything in firestone, u might know idk

@bonnie591 i think i know what happened with the lava thing


[17-Jun-21 05:20 PM] ethan;#0003
so, seems like a typical sierra move


[17-Jun-21 05:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Lava asked sierra for notes, siera gave her the notes and when sierra got introuble for sharing notes, she snitched that lava was using her notes so they both got terminated and lava got mad at her


[17-Jun-21 05:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and sierra cant take any critisizm so she probs then went to try and find the smallest things to report lava for


[17-Jun-21 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hm yeah that's probs what happened


[17-Jun-21 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591

The thing is they are purposely leaving him out in public mr channels.


[18-Jun-21 09:14 AM] Tattoblue#5828
If she didn‚Äôt want him to hear her she could‚Äôve just gone to a private one yeah


[18-Jun-21 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
If they wanted to show their voice to people they trusted they should not have done it in the staff vc then purposely mute when someone they don‚Äôt like joins.


[18-Jun-21 09:15 AM] stacey#1000
This isn‚Äôt the first time either they have done something like this smh


[18-Jun-21 09:15 AM] stacey#1000
Just muting when someone joins is not that big of a deal but changing the status and then unmuting and saying ‚Äúwe can talk now‚Äù when they leave is rude


[18-Jun-21 09:17 AM] stacey#1000
Ok got enough votes for suspension. Since there is 2 does someone want to help suspend


[18-Jun-21 10:50 AM] stacey#1000

Greetings Soccerlover748,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as rank 11 | Management from Bloxton Hotels as of June, 18th, 2021 at 12:20 PM EST.  The reasoning behind your suspension is due to purposely leaving out other MRs and acting rude/disrespectful towards them in the MR VC‚Äôs and channels, and changing your status to target another MR. I have made multiple announcements regarding inclusion in these channels and to respect other MRs while in a VC or any MR channel. It is not expected for you to be friends with every single MR, but it is expected that in staff lounge, or any MR channel, VC, etc that you are being inclusive and respectful towards everyone. If there is an MR you do not get along with, while talking in a VC or the MR channels and they are there as well you must still be inclusive and kind towards them. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude on June 21st, 2021 at 12:20 PM EST  and then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

They said they sent a statement to Bonnie and I'm waiting for him to send it.


[18-Jun-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Okay, so what happened was when someone joined I muted because I don‚Äôt really talk in staff vc‚Äôs, only to people I feel comfortable around and I don‚Äôt talk to everyone. The person knew about it beforehand, and asked Sammy if they could join & hear her talk, which she said she‚Äôs not ready to and would rather him not. That person has done stuff in the past like saying voices make them feel some type of way & saying that a certain type of people (Australians) are annoying, even had a status about them. About my status, it‚Äôs some in real life stuff that happened with my friend yesterday. Pretty ironic, but the only reason I didn‚Äôt talk is the screenshots I‚Äôll be sending. I did unmute like a minute after he left, but personally I didn‚Äôt say anything that would make him believe that it was him who left. I‚Äôm not trying to appeal my suspension or anything, but I‚Äôd like to show why I didn‚Äôt talk to him.

[18-Jun-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
So like that‚Äôs the only reason I didn‚Äôt talk to him, I knew he was aware of me not wanting to talk to some people  so when he joined I thought he knew it was fine that we muted. I wouldn‚Äôt purposely exclude him, it was just if I feel comfortable to MR‚Äôs.


[18-Jun-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
That's what soccer said


[18-Jun-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sam said


[18-Jun-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
We didn‚Äôt try to exclude him and Cory knew I was gonna mute if many Mrs joined, it wasn‚Äôt just to Noah and I think he thinks that. Noah asked beforehand and said it‚Äôs fine if I don‚Äôt speak to him. I don‚Äôt think that I said anything to make him feel like I was purposely talking to anyone but him. Also, after that situation, him and Sarah decided to go in music channel and play songs targeted towards me. I‚Äôm only aware because Noah told me before the song mean by Taylor swift reminds him of me, he was also pinging Sarah in staff lounge along with it. Later after that, he dmed me, and was really salty about me not voice revealing to him, when I already stated I wasn‚Äôt going to speak to him. I explained the situation in DMs, and I think when he reported me he was only doing it because of issues we‚Äôve had in the past.

[18-Jun-21 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
I explained to them that next time if they didn't want to speak with someone like that to do it in a private vc and not the public MR one


[18-Jun-21 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
so they learned for next time

If he‚Äôs talking suicidal like that to people over a suspension and making them feel uncomfortable without getting help irl.........not learning from a suspension, I would terminate

hmm, i feel like a termination would be suitable


[18-Jun-21 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs kind of like guilt tripping. He gets suspended, then turns into the victim and does this to try to reverse it...


[18-Jun-21 07:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
sam or soccer mentioned that he guilt tripped her as well but yeah i agree with a termination


[18-Jun-21 07:09 PM] katie#0200
Yeah same, agreed w term


[18-Jun-21 07:21 PM] stacey#1000
Need one more agreement then BOD approval and he can get terminated

[18-Jun-21 07:29 PM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue since you suspended would you like to terminate all you have to do is send a new letter and rank down to 1


[18-Jun-21 07:30 PM] Tattoblue#5828
sure what would i put for the termination reason tho


[18-Jun-21 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
I would say like not learning from the suspension and dming multiple mrs and making them feel uncomfortable as if guilt tripping others or something similar to that


[18-Jun-21 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
Or dming other MRs


[18-Jun-21 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
Not multiple MRs

[21-Jun-21 07:40 PM] cory!#8287
are seniors still supposed to use the #grammar-test chat


[21-Jun-21 11:12 PM] Polk#1596
As far as I am aware they still need to get their grammar test approved


[21-Jun-21 11:13 PM] Polk#1596
Not like I really care about it existing, it was useful back when people went overboard with it but I'm sure everyone has a decent understanding now of how to make grammar tests just right


[21-Jun-21 11:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Oh wait


[21-Jun-21 11:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[21-Jun-21 11:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Are u say this whole time that channel was for us to approve grammar test for seniors?


[21-Jun-21 11:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If so, I thought it was for grammar test recommendations. LOL


[21-Jun-21 11:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like seniors sharing working grammar test like recommendations


[21-Jun-21 11:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like if i wanted to switch up my grammar test, I WOULD JUST GO GET ONE OUT OF THERE LOL


[22-Jun-21 01:24 AM] ethan;#0003
It was made when there was an influx of impossible grammar tests


[22-Jun-21 01:24 AM] ethan;#0003
Like a year and a half ago


[22-Jun-21 01:24 AM] ethan;#0003
With words that are barely even English


[22-Jun-21 01:25 AM] ethan;#0003
But idk if it‚Äôs rlly needed anymore as people have phased out of the impossible words


[22-Jun-21 01:41 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah i dont think it's really needed anymore, its kinda just taking up space. idk if anyone is against us just deleting it?


[22-Jun-21 01:41 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@High Rank ^


[22-Jun-21 01:45 AM] ethan;#0003
I think we need to go though one day and go through all the channels and see what ones we really need and don‚Äôt need


[22-Jun-21 01:45 AM] ethan;#0003
Because there are a ton


[22-Jun-21 02:01 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
same with senior game nights, I feel like we could probably move that to the trello board if anything.


[22-Jun-21 02:16 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Wait


[22-Jun-21 02:16 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Didnt..


[22-Jun-21 02:17 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Wasn‚Äôt there a list like that before?


[22-Jun-21 02:26 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it was more of a schedule. really the discord channel is just used as a ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm hosting a game today at around 7pm‚Äù and it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs used every single day tbh. idk we can keep it but I don‚Äôt think it necessarily needs it‚Äôs own channel


[22-Jun-21 02:27 AM] anna#0004
wait


[22-Jun-21 02:28 AM] anna#0004
oh wait yeah i dont think we should keep that channel either


[22-Jun-21 04:46 AM] stacey#1000
I think we should because we had it on trello before for mr gamenights and theh never used it. It‚Äôs just so seniors are aware to not host a gamenight when someone else is planning it. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for.


[22-Jun-21 04:46 AM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think we should remove it right now


[22-Jun-21 09:04 AM] stacey#1000
I mean I guess we could get rid of it cause not all seniors even host gamenights


[22-Jun-21 10:20 AM] Polk#1596
Is it a really big deal though


[22-Jun-21 10:21 AM] Polk#1596
Like if another HR does a gamenight im not gonna cry about it, just gonna wait 30 minutes and then host it


[22-Jun-21 03:54 PM] katie#0200
hi can cvarity the former mr (iiClaritty or smth I think) get the former role?


[22-Jun-21 03:55 PM] katie#0200

[25-Jun-21 03:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[25-Jun-21 03:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[25-Jun-21 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
OMG! guys! I just got head receptionist!


[25-Jun-21 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[25-Jun-21 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
it would be better if people just added


[25-Jun-21 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
receptionist right after


[25-Jun-21 03:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah people just think its effort to add the receptionist part and when we are referring to all 3 head ranks we call it head


[25-Jun-21 03:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
lovely


[25-Jun-21 06:45 PM] ethan;#0003
Some people use their rank as a social status

[27-Jun-21 07:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
for something bad


[27-Jun-21 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
libby has had like immaturity issues in the past but she has improved quite a lot and shes very active so i agree!


[27-Jun-21 07:36 PM] stacey#1000

thank u! that made no difference to the result at all


[28-Jun-21 07:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
honestly last time someone called me jess was so long ago


[28-Jun-21 07:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
everyone calls me "ace"


[28-Jun-21 07:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
but i feel like its bc jessica/jess doesnt get mentioned as much and there was others too


[28-Jun-21 07:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
which confused some


[28-Jun-21 07:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
because she was a senior i actually dmed sometimes. i only talk to like 2 of the seniors now


[28-Jun-21 07:41 PM] courtney#5125
theres a lot of ppl named jess


[28-Jun-21 07:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
usually seniors dont talk to me until they get hr unless they ask to host or something


[28-Jun-21 07:42 PM] courtney#5125
you probably intimidate them


[28-Jun-21 07:42 PM] bonnie591#0591

bro 4 managers on my server, all of them managed to miss reception completely and kick the only head in the server as excess when my PM even says to name excess heads as backup. Bruh verbal warning for all of them time


[29-Jun-21 04:42 PM] lyss#0709

[29-Jun-21 04:43 PM] lyss#0709

i didnt even know q2uuii was a manager when the heck did that happen


[29-Jun-21 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
i dont usually warn people but like i had to idk how tf they managed to miss reception completely with 4 of them and kick the only head in the server as excess....


[29-Jun-21 04:47 PM] lyss#0709
thats very weird how did 4 managers entirely miss recep and no one noticed


[29-Jun-21 04:47 PM] lyss#0709
yeah that makes no sense


[29-Jun-21 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
they had very poor communication, did not pay attention, and rushed hence this happening


[29-Jun-21 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
so like no doubt they all get a warning on their record now

poor jedi


[29-Jun-21 04:49 PM] courtney#5125
it feels like managers lately are always speeding through naming as fast as they possibly can, its kinda annoying


[29-Jun-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
i think we should announce to all of them


[29-Jun-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
let me announce here first for opinions


[29-Jun-21 04:49 PM] courtney#5125
obviously its a problem if 4 managers missed an entire rank


[29-Jun-21 04:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
rip


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
anyone want to make an announcement to them im lazy


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] acelesteq#9395
Honestly it‚Äôs probably due to management thinking that all hosts pms are the same


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] acelesteq#9395
And stuff


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
i can help make it but im also lazy


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] acelesteq#9395
uhh


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
yeah probably


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] acelesteq#9395
I‚Äôm too new


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] acelesteq#9395
LOL


[29-Jun-21 04:54 PM] courtney#5125
i can make it


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Dang how did 4 managers miss reception


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] courtney#5125
unless u want to do ur first one jess!


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Crazy


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
omg yes tyy. the main thing is to have better communication at sessions, not rush naming, follow pms, and not to kick excess until they are 100% sure naming is done.


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
ikr like I was shocked


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] courtney#5125
okayy got it!


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] cory!#8287
yes it‚Äôs happened to me before like a couple months ago with like 3 managers


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] cory!#8287
idk how it happens tbh


[29-Jun-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
and the thing is there wasnt even a lot of trainees either


[29-Jun-21 04:56 PM] stacey#1000
no security at all, 2 reception, 3 bar, and 3 housekeeping with 4 managers naming and they miss reception completely, and kick the only rank 10 in the server


[29-Jun-21 04:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Smh


[29-Jun-21 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
im going to announce to seniors as well to make sure to supervise them more closely when they are naming


[29-Jun-21 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney can you also add not to rush looking through chatlogs and it should be done properly because seniors are telling me managers are rushing it and not even reviewing them and just naming them checked a lot of the time


[29-Jun-21 05:09 PM] courtney#5125
yup yup yup


[29-Jun-21 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
and not to fail them for simple things like 3 periods


[29-Jun-21 05:11 PM] courtney#5125
alr!


[29-Jun-21 05:20 PM] courtney#5125
:pieza_checkmark: | **NAMING AT SESSIONS**

Greetings, @Management 

Recently, it has come to the attention of the High-Rank Team that Managers have been speeding through the naming process at training sessions and lacking to follow PMs sent by the host. Failing to communicate and be thorough while naming creates issues for the entire server when it leads to the wrong amount of helpers being selected, excess getting kicked too early, ranks being missed, etc.

At training, Managers should be **taking their time** and paying attention during the naming process, considering it's one of your vital duties. There's no reason to rush through it and try to get done as fast as possible, it isn't a race. Additionally, all Managers should successfully be able to read and follow PMs that are sent to them throughout a session. If you forget a piece of information, you can always look back at admin logs or speak with the host, but mistakes shouldn't be made as a result of being careless.

Last but not least, please ensure that you are truly taking the time to check trainees' chatlogs, don't simply assume they passed and name them "Checked." We double-check chatlogs for a reason, that is to be sure that the trainee received the proper training, did everything correctly, and used passable grammar. With that being said, keep in mind that we do not fail users for small things such as missing 3 punctuation marks. Remember that users can pass as long as their grammar is up to par, it in no way needs to be perfect.


Best regards,
c6urtney

[29-Jun-21 06:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
why are managers trying to get helpers in general discussion


[29-Jun-21 06:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
that seems like a waste of time especially when people can just do 2 trainees at a time


[29-Jun-21 06:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
as long as the helper is competent and the trainee is ok then it shouldnt take too long


[29-Jun-21 06:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
idk if they are letting the trainer help as well but if they arent then....


[29-Jun-21 06:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
back in the day helpers got like 3 trainees lol it didnt take too long from what i remember


[29-Jun-21 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
they had to ask general discussion for me because they legit forgot about reception altogether and didnt name anyone @bonnie591


[29-Jun-21 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
i told them to fix it and get recep


[29-Jun-21 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
That's fine but like


[29-Jun-21 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Normally when they run out of staff


[29-Jun-21 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
They shouldn't ask in gd


[29-Jun-21 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
yeah no they shouldnt be doing that


[29-Jun-21 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
ive never seen that happen at my sessions


[29-Jun-21 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
If I see it again I'll do an announcement


[29-Jun-21 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Might of been a one off since its rare it happens
