:washiez: **High Rank // Operations Department Application |** @Staff Member 

Greetings everyone!

Many of you have been patiently waiting for the opportunity to become a member of our High Rank Team and now is your chance! The newly formed Operations Department is looking for many new and experienced users to join us in jumpstarting the ~~best~~ department here at Washiez!

Below you will find the link to our application, please take a moment to read over the requirements that are listed before you begin your application. We ask that you take your time and put some consideration into your answers while completing this application. Anyone above the rank of Junior Operator is welcome to apply!

If you make it past the application phase, you will be required to undergo an interview with one of our Chief Operating Officers. These interviews may also be observed by any member of the Operations Department. You are required to have a microphone and be open to speaking in a VC. 

The main goals of the operations department are to supervise the game, answer tickets and promote users at trainings. The official list of duties is obviously more in-depth but these are the main tasks you would be completing on a day to day basis. 

**THESE ARE FOR JUNIOR OPERATOR+**

On behalf of the Operations Department, we wish you the best of luck!

*These applications will close in less than 24 hours.*

**APPLICATIONS ARE NOW CLOSED**

Hello there! Thanks to the efforts of myself, @Brayden (@robloxminecra123) and @Iced (@FormallyIced) the wait is over and we're finally ready to announce who has passed the recent High Rank applications! The following users submitted excellent applications which lead to them being accepted to move onto our interview process! 

(If your name is listed below, you should've received a DM from me with an invite to our interview server, if you have not received one of these by 5 PM EST, please reach out to me.)

If your name is not on this list, do not be discouraged. We received over 1,000 applications and of that only 31 users have been accepted to move onto the next phase. We unfortunately had to deny a lot of amazing applicants as it was extremely competitive. 

On behalf of the operations department, we wish everyone the best of luck in their future endeavors and a successful future within Washiez! 

*Note: Users who did not pass are not allowed to request a reasoning as we had far too many declined applications to properly do this.*

:pin: **COMMUNITY UPDATE**

I understand there's been complaints over the removal of admin commands from Shift Leaders and Supervisors. I'd like to clear up any confusion and explain what's happening moving forward.

The reason we removed abilities from some ranks was due to an upcoming update. We realize the importance of our MRs who moderate the car wash and deal with any trollers. It was a mistake on our part to remove this ability and recognize the value in our MR team.

In the next update, all of these issues will be resolved. We will be releasing a new system that will be heavily moderated but ensures that MRs can do their jobs properly. We hear you guys and will do everything we can to make improvements like this.

More information will be released soon. I've opened my DMs temporarily for any questions that you have. Thanks for your understanding!

Hey, Washiez! I hope you all are having a great start of your week. Recently, myself and many others have getting DM's asking to join a server telling them their DM's got exposed. When you join, it instructs you to verify. Once you finish the steps, they then gain access to your Discord account. Saying this, please do not click suspicious links from anyone, even if they are a friend! Please stay safe out there, and have a great rest of your day/night!

As mentioned above this announcement, we will be hosting these shifts on a bi-weekly basis every other **Friday** at varying times depending on our department's availability. Our department members are scattered among servers at the car wash to look for potential promotions! For more information on receiving one of these promotions, keep reading!

**How can I get promoted?**

Activity and your in-game minutes will be considered when making our final list. Asking a higher rank, expressing an aspiration for, or hinting towards a promotion is prohibited as a staff member and will result in your chances being lowered by a massive amount.

Our department members have their joins on in order to assist you in finding a server!

The applicants who passed submitted amazing applications and have shown great effort in applying for this position. Please check out the results below.

Congratulations, everyone! Wait momentarily as we work on ranking each of you. In the meantime, passers will be messaged by a member of the Human Resources Department shortly with more information regarding your new position. Please use the ``/getrole`` command in #commands in order to update your roles. If you did not pass this round of applications, stay tuned for upcoming applications being released. 

We will not be giving individuals any reasoning behind their failure due to the massive amount of applications. If you did not pass, please assume that your application's detail did not compare to others or that your answers did not follow our standards of passing. Thank you and have a wonderful rest of your day!

Hello, everyone! As of today, we will be discontinuing our monthly MR applications. The Human Resources Department and Super Ranks have decided that the applications are not allowing us to hire the most capable and highest quality Shift Leaders. Alongside this, we have formulated a brand new recommendation process for Head Operators to be recruited for the rank of Shift Leader. This recruitment process will allow us to hire the most deserving Head Operators.

Read through the following document regarding this new process.
> 🔗 **Head Operator Recommendation Process**:
> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TBggyNTC7Mi2hMsxTHm02JlZnN7U_AhlwN6sRfesCFM/edit?usp=sharing

The Human Resources Department will be starting this process **today**. There is no specific time frame when you can be recommended as well, it will be ongoing at any time/day. Any hinting or hostile remarks regarding recommendations will lower your chances greatly. If you have any questions, feel free to make a ticket in #support.

:washiez: The final session of the day, 9:00 PM EST, has been cancelled due to Roblox’s chat filter being broken. We will stay informed and hope that it is fixed before tomorrow’s training cycle begins. Operations members will be going around servers to handle cancellations. Thank you for your patience in advance!

:washiez: **Discord Channel Revamp**

Hey everyone! All of the information channels in the Discord server have been updated. These channels are up-to-date with our latest changes. The documents linked in the information channels are NEW. The old documents are NOT in use anymore. 

Here are a few things to check out...

:blue_arrow: The brand-new promotion guide is in #staff-information with our updated requirements for Head Operators looking to become a Shift Leader. Promotional batches are described for the @Supervision Team as well.

:red_arrow: The #supervision-information and #management-information channels contain new guides for the Supervision and Management Team. Once again, the old guides are no longer used.

:blue_arrow: The DevForum handbook has been released for those without Discord. You'll find much less information since it's targeted for our younger players. However, you're welcome to check it out and share it with a friend who's not on the Discord server. This handbook is linked on the group and game page. 
🔗 **Washiez DevForum Handbook:** <https://devforum.roblox.com/t/washiez-handbook/2062480>

Thank you to @vehuio for creating the banners and @rachvii for writing the content for our new channels. Open a ticket in #support if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you!

:washiez: **Clarification of the Warning System**

Hello, everyone! We have noticed that there needs to be more explanation for all rank tiers when it comes to our warning system and what to do, which can be found below:

:blue_dot: **Entry Team:** One verbal warning should be given, and then you should call a Supervision Team member to assist you further if the situation persists.

:blue_dot: **Supervision Team:** Three warnings from our staff panel should be given, and you should jail them after they have reached 3 of them. If further assistance is needed following that, you should call a Management Team member for assistance.

:blue_dot: **Management Team:** Members of these ranks should be called when additional assistance is needed, or when someone is jailed multiple times. For more extreme situations such as exploiting, glitching, etc, they should get a JC+ to pban accordingly.

I am excited to announce that @lilly has been selected as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. She will now be leading the Human Resources Department alongside @celine (@mrbrowncangomoo).

Hello Washiez! I would like to share that @Brayden (@robloxminecra123) will step down from his position as Chief Administrative Officer. While we are sad to see him go, please wish him the best in his future.

During Brayden's time at Washiez, he showed excellent activity and responsibility. He began as a Shift Leader and gradually moved up the ranks due to his consistent activity. His hard work did not go unnoticed.

Even if you don't know him personally, he was an integral part of our group. Brayden's kindness, humor, and generosity helped grow and shape this community.

On behalf of the Leadership Team, we thank Brayden for his service at Washiez.

:washiez: **Cancer Awareness: Help Support Our Head Corporate's Family**

Hello, Washiez! I am so saddened to bring you this devastating news. Our outstanding Head Corporate, a beloved member of our community, recently suffered an unspeakable loss. Yoselyn has lost her mother, a remarkable individual who fought a courageous battle against stage 4 stomach cancer and unfortunately passed. Our communities thoughts and prayers are with Ana's husband and four wonderful children at this difficult time.

This Head Corporate has been an incredible help to our team, and we wish to support them in any way we can. With this announcement, I am reaching out to the people of our community who are willing to help this lovely family in any shape or form. Any donation, regardless of size will make a significant difference to their lives to help them cover any expenses and ease the stress and anxiety they may be facing during this time. Please share this GoFundMe with your friends and family to help raise awareness. All donations are greatly appreciated. Donation information will be provided below to those who are able to help Yoselyn and her family.

Firstly, the Leadership Team and I would like to thank @paceive for contributing to Washiez for over a year. Yesterday, she stepped down from her position of Chief Public Relations Officer and we wish her the best moving forward.

With this new change, I am extremely excited to announce that @mia will be the new Chief Public Relations Officer alongside @jasmine (@passivekitty111). We are excited to see what Mia will achieve with her new role. Please congratulate and welcome her in her new position in #staff-chat!

:washiez: **Leadership Team Promotion**

Before we get to some exciting news, the Leadership Team and I would like to acknowledge our former Chief Public Relations Officer, @jasmine (@passivekitty111), and her contributions to Washiez throughout her time here. She unfortunately resigned and left the platform last month but we would still like to thank her for everything she did as one of our longest-standing Leadership Team members.

That being said, I am extremely excited to announce that @ryomen will be the new Chief Public Relations Officer alongside @mia. We are excited to see what Szn will achieve with her new role. Please congratulate and welcome her in her new position in #staff-chat!

:washiez: **Leadership Team Resignation**

Hello Washiez! I want to share that Rachel (@rachvii) is stepping down from her positions as Chief Administrative Officer. While it's sad to see her go, we wish her the best in the future.

Rachel was an outstanding employee during her time at Washiez, displaying excellent activity and responsibility. She started her career as a Trainee and worked her way up the ranks through consistent hard work and dedication. Rachel's journey displays the opportunity for employees to grow and succeed during their career at Washiez. 

Even if you didn't know her personally, Rachel was an essential part of our community. Rachel's compassion, humor, and selflessness helped grow and shape this community. 

On behalf of the rest of the Leadership Team, we thank Rachel for her service at Washiez.

Hey, everyone! Before I continue onto the promotion, I would firstly like to acknowledge and thank our former Chief Operating Officer, @bryson (@PastelFanta). Bryson has done amazing work for his department and the entire Washiez community so for that, on behalf of the Leadership Team, we would like to thank him for his service.

Moving on, as there is now a vacancy in the Chief Operating Officer position, I am thrilled to announce we have found the perfect candidate for the position. Please welcome @livina (@desigwn) as the new Chief Operating Officer alongside @Dancegal127. We look forward to seeing what Liv will bring and achieve in her new position.
