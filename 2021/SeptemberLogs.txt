As long as it isn't brought into bloxton games or our discord server then it's fine. Something just to note so we can keep an eye on it


[01-Sep-21 03:46 PM] acelesteq#9395
^yeah. I mean it just seems like one point of view from one who admitted to them being ‚Äúin love‚Äù if anything, it seems personal wise.


[01-Sep-21 04:36 PM] cory!#8287
I honestly don‚Äôt see a problem with it tbh since it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with Bloxton and it‚Äôs not in Roblox


[01-Sep-21 06:11 PM] stacey#1000
They are not the first MRs to online date.,,,,no issue with it if they are not being inappropriate in a game server.

LMAOO IT WENT FROM ARGUING ABT A PING TO BEING DISRESPECTFUL


[02-Sep-21 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
why is he complaining about taking 2 seconds to ping someone...


[02-Sep-21 03:32 PM] cory!#8287

6 months unappealable former role


[02-Sep-21 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
anything else?


[02-Sep-21 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
i feel like his status warrants him a staff blacklist


[02-Sep-21 03:40 PM] acelesteq#9395
Yeah


[02-Sep-21 03:40 PM] acelesteq#9395
He complicated to me about his warning last time (as you saw) but he told me he has a disabled


[02-Sep-21 03:40 PM] acelesteq#9395
So I understood why he acted in such way


[02-Sep-21 03:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@bonnie591 that person pinged me like yesterday asking if I was gonna marry them and it‚Äôs lowkey weird üò≠


[02-Sep-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOL


[02-Sep-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
ah i see


[02-Sep-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
do we staff blacklist or should we just leave it at an unappealable former for 6 months


[02-Sep-21 03:44 PM] cory!#8287
unappealable former imo


[02-Sep-21 03:44 PM] cory!#8287
I doubt he‚Äôs gonna become a staff member after that üíÄ

aw well thats ok tell him not to worry. unfortunately nothing can be reversed though such as his former role and mute


[02-Sep-21 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
right

ok


[02-Sep-21 04:24 PM] acelesteq#9395
@bonnie591 as for the second thread, I voted no because threads seem to be unusual when placed into important things such as promo tbh and I would wanna wait in order to see how it would work out not just right off the bat just yet!


[02-Sep-21 04:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
ya ya, just seeing what u think since threads are useless so they are the only 2 ideas i could think of


[02-Sep-21 04:25 PM] acelesteq#9395
plus the channel we have rn is decent and has been running without any issues


[02-Sep-21 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
I voted no on the promo suggest one cause i think it defeats the purpose of allowing seniors to add it to the board and comment on it. it was a perk like just for seniors.


[02-Sep-21 06:08 PM] acelesteq#9395

its full with people from bloxton but also those who are blacklisted due to a invite contest ive heard


[03-Sep-21 06:58 PM] acelesteq#9395
i also noticed recently that ava  (kylie) is the co-owner


[03-Sep-21 06:58 PM] acelesteq#9395
im bringing this up as a *maybe* suggestion, maybe try to talk to flurry to see if he knows kylie like that in order to see if she knows which alts and stuff are like that


[03-Sep-21 06:59 PM] acelesteq#9395
basically him going behind her back to tell us which accounts and so on yk


[03-Sep-21 06:59 PM] acelesteq#9395
its a risk too because idk how close they are but just something i was thinking

@cory! did you ask him to open dms


[03-Sep-21 07:17 PM] ethan;#0003
with people


[03-Sep-21 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like this is another Aidan situation where he closed DMs on purpose not to get  caught and deleted stuff.  If there is proof it is him with the like right discord tag and stuff to where he said he was an alt or whatever that is enough proof.


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
I wanna see the video


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
@cory! @Tattoblue did you already end the investigation


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
Like this is legit the same thing as Aidan all over again....


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
Which aidan...


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
can you add me to the group chat if you didnt end it yet


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@ethan; ye we asked them to open dms with james, kylie  umm who else


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
The one that got fired for leaking but it took months for him to get fired


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they had to go


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828
apparently

[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] cory!#8287
ya they were either random LRs or MRs


[03-Sep-21 07:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
Tbh it isn't adding up, cause ofc if a former is bringing him up


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] acelesteq#9395
It's an issue/red flag


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they said they had like 2 discord alts


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
too


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
made no sense


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
This is legit the same thing all over again where we are sus of him then all of a sudden there is no proof. He took too long to reply because he deleted stuff.


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
and their oldest DM was in  august


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
shoulda been the people j6mescharles was talking to in the dms


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
in the server*


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs literally obvious he deleted stuff and closed DMs while he was not replying


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
he probs closed the dms


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] acelesteq#9395
Can I be added too?


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
If you say he took too long to reply he was covering his tracks.


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
and


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003
wait


[03-Sep-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
Add me as well.


[03-Sep-21 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
wait 1 sec


[03-Sep-21 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
This is the same this as Aidan we can‚Äôt fall for this again.


[03-Sep-21 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
@Tattoblue whow as the last person we investegated


[03-Sep-21 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
who was on mobile


[03-Sep-21 07:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
idek


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
@acelesteq dont say anything yet just watch for now


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] cory!#8287
We told him to open DMs with James and other people that Min brought up but they didnt have any dm history with them


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] cory!#8287
Which was strange


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
where they friends on discord


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
We suspended Aidan once before and found nothing because he deleted stuff. He stayed on the mr team for a few more months till we suspended again and finally got proof.


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
tatto investigated aidan and found nothing


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
He deleted everything that‚Äôs why.


[03-Sep-21 07:26 PM] cory!#8287
nope they weren‚Äôt friends


[03-Sep-21 07:27 PM] ethan;#0003
but then a few months later tatto and i found everything


[03-Sep-21 07:27 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright


[03-Sep-21 07:27 PM] ethan;#0003
and then he was getting pissed at us LMAO


[03-Sep-21 07:27 PM] stacey#1000
Yea cause Aidan deletes it all.


[03-Sep-21 07:27 PM] stacey#1000
Idk I‚Äôm just saying I have a bad feeling it‚Äôs another Aidan situation all over again.

I mean we could do the same thing we did for Aidan for months. Hold him back from Manager forever because of suspicion that we were right on all along.

[03-Sep-21 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
If they are trying to act like they didn‚Äôt know how to report why do it perfect the next day on what I pointed out

He joined the discord may 14th 2020, reports the next day may 15th with no error. Then reports more on the 20th. He could‚Äôve made this acc knowing he was going to get fired on the other one while he was under investigation if he was then gets fired.

Cause I was looking around the discord servers

and she always tagged people like ava (Kylie) ayesh (another former I'd believe)

and someone else named Bella who is close to Kylie as well

The only thing I have to say about it being a senior is no senior content has been leaked to our knowledge.

Yeah but they could also be playing it smart

[03-Sep-21 08:01 PM] acelesteq#9395
For example; i care about my account cause i have limiteds and stuff on it but I can always get my password changed with  email etc


[03-Sep-21 08:02 PM] acelesteq#9395
Like idk for two alts accounts and you somehow cant get in??


[03-Sep-21 08:02 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ya they said they lost access to their alts but like one of their alts last chatted in july in the bh discord


[03-Sep-21 08:02 PM] Tattoblue#5828
how so


[03-Sep-21 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
drxconite and skyfvlls are both in it


[03-Sep-21 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
This guy just needs to stop lying at this point.


[03-Sep-21 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
it would only have signifigance if inndentation is james


[03-Sep-21 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs too obv.


[03-Sep-21 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
@Tattoblue when inn had there inventory open did you look at t-shirts and clothing


[03-Sep-21 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
to see if tehre was any obvious donation t shirts to transfer robux


[03-Sep-21 08:04 PM] acelesteq#9395
Honestly I agree with the too obv part the dude legit admitted here

[03-Sep-21 08:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
I think this indetention guy probs doesn't use his alt discord account to show proof


[03-Sep-21 08:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
But is using the james discord account to contact people


[03-Sep-21 08:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
Which is why it came out clear on his discord


[03-Sep-21 08:06 PM] acelesteq#9395
Like let's be honest, if you're gonna get caught or investigated cause you made an alt. You wouldn't want to use your discord account of the alt because someone can rat you out but instead you would use your main account to text your friends about it


[03-Sep-21 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[03-Sep-21 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs too obv to me and I think there is  a 95% he‚Äôs lying and took too long to reply because he was covering his tracks.


[03-Sep-21 08:07 PM] acelesteq#9395
Right


[03-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ethan;#0003

james said


[03-Sep-21 08:07 PM] ethan;#0003
4th mr account


[03-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ethan;#0003
skyfvlls + drxconite + j6mes + inndentation


[03-Sep-21 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs one of those people that waste time getting promoted over and over again and gets caught every time.


[03-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ethan;#0003
im asking him questions about each account


[03-Sep-21 08:08 PM] ethan;#0003
when he answsers


[03-Sep-21 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
Ask him why he magically knew how to report the next day too


[03-Sep-21 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
Without error.


[03-Sep-21 08:10 PM] acelesteq#9395
Keep in mind he also claims that P6rickstarrr is his other account


[03-Sep-21 08:10 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Sep-21 08:39 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
what timezone was j6mes


[03-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
we should really keep track of former mr's timezones


[03-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
because if they where all BST


[03-Sep-21 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
then that would be more proof


[03-Sep-21 08:50 PM] cory!#8287
they were either CST or BST i think


[03-Sep-21 08:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
Check their user id in bot logs


[03-Sep-21 08:54 PM] cory!#8287
nothing comes up about a timezone role


[03-Sep-21 08:55 PM] cory!#8287
just says head of security/services, mr team, nd bloxton employee role


[03-Sep-21 08:55 PM] cory!#8287

[03-Sep-21 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôm pretty sure the j6mescharles account was in an American timezone


[03-Sep-21 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought EST


[03-Sep-21 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
could be wrong though


[03-Sep-21 08:58 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I believe j6mes is EST


[03-Sep-21 08:58 PM] Tattoblue#5828

to my knowledge, it's a group chat consisting of around 10 blacklisted members from bloxton. one of the people inside of the GC is an MR at Bloxton, and they've been informing me whenever something important is mentioned about blacklisted members on ALTs which is how I've been able to retrieve evidence. make sure not to leak any of the evidence from that GC outside of the HR Team for now though as otherwise they'll know it's the MR who is leaking to me and then we'll lose our inside source of information!


[04-Sep-21 01:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm 90% certain he's an ALT, specifically the ALT of jamescharles, so it would probably be a good idea to place him under investigation and question him soon

oh alright, just don't show him any of the evidence

[04-Sep-21 01:02 PM] Tattoblue#5828
one of their oldest DMs was from august 2021 but their account has been around for a year so they definetly deleted DMs before we had them screenshare

@ethan; if they do it on ipad and nothing comes up, this is where you should ask if they have discord opened on the phone rn too


[04-Sep-21 04:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
then get them to join the VC within seconds


[04-Sep-21 04:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
and screenshare


[04-Sep-21 04:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
from there tell them to go to search and do the same like they are rn with ipad


[04-Sep-21 04:30 PM] ethan;#0003
if i say


[04-Sep-21 04:30 PM] ethan;#0003
"Can you close discord on your phone"


[04-Sep-21 04:31 PM] ethan;#0003
and if she says
