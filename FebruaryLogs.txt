[01-Feb-20 12:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You can do the role change while I still have time.


[01-Feb-20 12:17 PM] stacey#1000

@Beartikal it’s happening but it doesn’t drop


[01-Feb-20 12:29 PM] ethan;#0003
The plates get stuck to him


[01-Feb-20 12:29 PM] ethan;#0003
So it isn’t as bad


[01-Feb-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey lucas is at trainings rn and i wont suspend until he is actually sent a letter so we can do it after


[01-Feb-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000

just lmk if u want to rn or later


[01-Feb-20 01:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, it looks like the letter isn't really possible until I get back until the evening. We could either stick with you writing the letter or have me do it later, then I can drop down his rank since I'll be back. I'm going to be playing basketball for a bit. Just ping me of what your answer will be on this. @stacey


[01-Feb-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
I have schoolwork to complete so I don't have time to write the letter rn @xAfroTrey

[01-Feb-20 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003

[01-Feb-20 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003

[01-Feb-20 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003
To doxx


[01-Feb-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435

[01-Feb-20 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003

[01-Feb-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435

[01-Feb-20 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
He tried to scare me last night by PayPal me a few cents


[01-Feb-20 02:08 PM] ethan;#0003
And he accidentally included his address


[01-Feb-20 02:10 PM] Polk#1596
be careful ethan


[01-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
he mightve made up a fake address to trick u


[01-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596

Aside from a few annoyances such as her treatment the Darren promotion and the leaking a while back, she is completely fine.

[01-Feb-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
I blocked her after that


[01-Feb-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
because I found it highly immature to complain over darren getting senior then bringing this omar guy into it


[01-Feb-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
@¢. ღ @xAfroTrey @emma; still agree?


[01-Feb-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
thats why I disagree


[01-Feb-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
she was higly rude and immature


[01-Feb-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
this was only about 3 months ago too


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
@bman ^


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
i mean darren harassed olivia for a while too


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
that's why she didn't like him


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
🤷


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
but y'all are up darren's ass so


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
hence why i didnt want him promoted lol


[01-Feb-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if she doesnt like darren thats fine


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
its complaining about it and acting immature is what I didnt like


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525
she told you that darren told someone to kill themselves


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525
and you didn't suspend him...?


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
thats what he was suspended for earlier


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
like when he was a manager


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack YOU HAD A HIT LIST LMAO


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] bman#0435
imma be honest i wasnt very happy when darren got senior either ngl


[01-Feb-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525
Darren was mean to olivia which is why she didn't like him


[01-Feb-20 04:11 PM] bman#0435
but i didnt go to an extreme and d what olivia did lol


[01-Feb-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
It's not her fault that her bully (and many other people's as well) got promoted to senior


[01-Feb-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
and she wasn't happy about it


[01-Feb-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[01-Feb-20 04:11 PM] bman#0435

o


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
If she doesn't like him thats fine, its just immature to complain over it. If  she doesnt like darren im not expecting her to talk to him, just really it pissed me off she complained over it, and idk how omar fit into it


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey also darren wasn't suspended for telling someone to kill themselves?

[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
this card has nothing to do with that


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
well she never actually showed me evidence of anything darren did


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
unless there was another suspension that i just totally missed and can't find


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
wasnt he also rly racist


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
yes


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, it was him being kind of racist too.


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
against chinese people


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
yoikers


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
his racist suspension was a diff one


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
i think


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, it wasn't separate.


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
he was suspended 2 different times?


[01-Feb-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
o


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
no


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
he wasn't


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
jk


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
o


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
there's only one suspension for him


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
and it had nothing to do with him being racist OR telling people to kioll themselves


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
so


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
darren is like another drap


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
personally i dont want to hold that against olivia


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
😌


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
bc darren was literally a shit person while she was at bh


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
well he was


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
and a lot of y'all didn't want to see that lol


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
ye


[01-Feb-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
darren was immature in the past yes, hence why it took him a bit to get senior


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] emma;#1525
you guys wanted to promote him to senior less than 3 months after a major suspension


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] emma;#1525
that's not darren improving over due time


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
if yall wanna give olivia former role thats fine im just explaining why I disagree ovefr it


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
over*


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] emma;#1525
that's you guys literally just wanting him for personal reasons and the legit reasons for him not being a safe worker were overlooked


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] emma;#1525
again, hence why he was never suspended for being racist


[01-Feb-20 04:14 PM] emma;#1525
but someone bypasses on a PS and we suspend them without a thought


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
jk lucas didnt even bypass


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He was suspended-


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] bman#0435
he did doe


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
inappropriate behavior >> racism i guess


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What the hell are you talking about-


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
i cannot find a card for darren being suspended that has that racism stuff on it


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] bman#0435
didnt darren do much worse tho


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
im looking for it but can't find it


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
Olivia didnt just complain over darren getting promoted


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The card you posted had the attachment-


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
she complained over omar never getting promoted too


[01-Feb-20 04:15 PM] bman#0435
bmans confusion has entered the chat


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oop


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
flyro sent an appeal but i don't think it's very good


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
oh i was thinking of the squinty eyes one he said


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
Thats my only concern with her getting former role....she acts immature over anything she doesnt agree with getting a promotion then calls it unfair that one of her good friends didnt get a promo...?


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
oh well

see my concern?


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
well she acted immature


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
periodt...?


[01-Feb-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
i havent seen her since her termination


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
Well this was more recent


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
see what i mean when i said it's not very good


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] emma;#1525
I mean we let darren be promoted to senior with his horrible past


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] emma;#1525
I don't see why we can't let olivia get former back for having legit concerns


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] emma;#1525
I complained about darren too


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] emma;#1525
No one yelled at me lol


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
how about her complaining over omar, one of her good friends not getting promoted?


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] emma;#1525
And that's a reason to not let her have former...?


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
and then sending random photos of mack


[01-Feb-20 04:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, it was stupid, but I don't think we should hold her back for that reason.


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
i mean tbh if we knew mack had sent that hit list crap i bet he would have been fired or suspended


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
he's just lucky olivia didn't send it earlier


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
bc that's what we fired mia over


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
so


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
you can give her former role thats fine


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
like i'll laugh about it now bc its too late and idc anymore


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
but I just stated my side of why I disagree


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Might as well give her the former role, she won the voting.


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
go ahead


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
is lucas suspended now btw


[01-Feb-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

darren was never given consequences for telling sky to kill herself or?


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, sadly.


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, that wasn't fun.


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
Is there any evidence of it


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
like idek when darren did that


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ya i think so


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, the team at the time took way too long to respond. Not to mention, the 5 votes thing didn't exist yet.


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i remember it being sent around a lot


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
well u can’t really do shit now


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, I've gotten shit for it.


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ik bc the evidence is far too old


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
if it was a while ago


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
too late now if it was months ago


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It lead to multiple insults and a lot of disrespect at the time.


[01-Feb-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
like 5+ months ago


[01-Feb-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't really wanna make it about myself, but holy shit, this was not fun to manage.


[01-Feb-20 04:27 PM] a. ღ#4222

[01-Feb-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
sky hates me tho so that's prob why olivia didnt speak up before


[01-Feb-20 04:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sky doesn't care about it anymore.

[02-Feb-20 12:09 AM] bman#0435
o?


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what's this


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's very well made


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll give it that


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] bman#0435
its literally 5 commands


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but i think it's things that could be easily added somewhere else


[02-Feb-20 12:10 AM] bman#0435
but ok


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah true


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
tbh thats not my issue with it tho


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
:kick syd,tres,ades,har,ethant,triu,stre,QRC,CUFF,mot,natC || CB.


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
im normally really quick with commands anyways


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
so there's no point


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
there can be multiple people with those usernaems


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
like


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
sydsyd8349nf


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
idk


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it can only hold around 4 usernames at one time if i'm not mistaken


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
but there could be a legitamite guest


[02-Feb-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
no it can be as many


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
thing is though


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
think about excess idiot


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
🤦


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
they change their names many times


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
ye


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
also


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
if they really wanted to use that doc


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
and there was a cb in their server


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
theyd need to locate which command they were in


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's not going to work all the time


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
which takes longer than typing


[02-Feb-20 12:12 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
and that's the frustrating part


[02-Feb-20 12:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what if they don't have a good device


[02-Feb-20 12:13 AM] bman#0435
theres also not priorities for who to kick first either


[02-Feb-20 12:13 AM] bman#0435
lol


[02-Feb-20 12:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's where it takes too long


[02-Feb-20 12:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
also i finished my letter for lucas, but i know this isn't going to be great


[02-Feb-20 12:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's test to see how he reacts


[02-Feb-20 12:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i would have done it today but there's a couple of things that held me back:


[02-Feb-20 12:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) playing basketball with others (took way longer than it should)


[02-Feb-20 12:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) got caught up in stacey's training and i was kind of relatively distracted with bliss on VC


[02-Feb-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
My NaMe Is TrEy AnD i HaVe A bAsKeTbAlL gAmE tOmRrOw


[02-Feb-20 12:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but yeah


[02-Feb-20 12:16 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[02-Feb-20 12:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
(in reality)


[02-Feb-20 12:21 AM] bman#0435
ur the one getting smacked


[02-Feb-20 12:21 AM] bman#0435
ur in the white


[02-Feb-20 12:21 AM] bman#0435
im in the blue


[02-Feb-20 12:21 AM] bman#0435
and i blocked ur dunk


[02-Feb-20 12:21 AM] bman#0435
hows it feel


[02-Feb-20 12:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i smell cap


[02-Feb-20 12:22 AM] bman#0435
i dont


[02-Feb-20 12:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
he didn't just block it


[02-Feb-20 12:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
he blocked + snatched it lmaooo


[02-Feb-20 12:23 AM] bman#0435
also may have interfered with the shot since the hoop and net moved a bit 👀


[02-Feb-20 12:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it didn't even move


[02-Feb-20 12:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wtf are you talking about


[02-Feb-20 12:24 AM] bman#0435
100% did


[02-Feb-20 12:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
if they touched the rim or the hoop, that would've been goaltending or an inference


[02-Feb-20 12:25 AM] bman#0435
hence y i said


[02-Feb-20 12:25 AM] bman#0435
interfered


[02-Feb-20 12:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] bman#0435
ok so


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
where did you see the net move


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
go ahead i'll wait


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] bman#0435
within the gif 💀


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
because he lowkey blocked him before he did a layup lmaoo


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
he literally wasn't even close you fucking dummy


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] bman#0435
hes literally in the air


[02-Feb-20 12:26 AM] bman#0435
and then got blocked


[02-Feb-20 12:27 AM] bman#0435
and blue dude merely skimmed his hand on the hoop


[02-Feb-20 12:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[02-Feb-20 12:28 AM] bman#0435

[03-Feb-20 05:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wha


[03-Feb-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
how so


[03-Feb-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
like what is he doing?


[03-Feb-20 05:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so basically


[03-Feb-20 05:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he tries to do literally everything


[03-Feb-20 05:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
at trainings


[03-Feb-20 05:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ive already confronted him before


[03-Feb-20 05:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bc


[03-Feb-20 05:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he said he would name a rank that had the most trainees in it right


[03-Feb-20 05:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and then a manager named the next available rank


[03-Feb-20 05:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
then another manager said they would kick excess


[03-Feb-20 05:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so then once he was done naming


[03-Feb-20 05:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he kicked the majority of excess


[03-Feb-20 05:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and that manager was like--


[03-Feb-20 05:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
"I was going to kick excess."


[03-Feb-20 05:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she even said that in the pm she sent out to everyone


[03-Feb-20 05:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and he just ignored her


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and she ended up kicking the rest of excess which was very few


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so i pmed him and told him to make sure he reads pms and all that


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he just basically tries to take control of everything


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
HE EVEN DID THE SAME THING


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
TODAY


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] katie#0200
oh jeez


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and im like


[03-Feb-20 05:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
d u d e


[03-Feb-20 05:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she said she was going to kick excess


[03-Feb-20 05:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
sounds like someone is getting hungry for control


[03-Feb-20 05:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
its literally drap 2.0


[03-Feb-20 05:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
im just hoping that he doesnt continue


[03-Feb-20 05:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bc ive had to tell him twice now


[03-Feb-20 05:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he says "ok"


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but if he doesnt listen then he clearly isnt acknowledging its wrong


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
tell him if he does it again he'll be officially warned and if he continues after that then it's a suspension


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
so he was warned before for it?


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
just verbally from bliss, i think


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
mhm


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
he should get an offical warning rn if hes done it more than once


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hes done it twice now


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
official*


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
so warn him officially maybe idk


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
give him one more chance


[03-Feb-20 05:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if he does it again ill warn him officially


[03-Feb-20 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[03-Feb-20 05:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
maybe he'll listen more if you tell him what will happen if he continues


[03-Feb-20 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
he hasnt been doing that on my servers


[03-Feb-20 05:09 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank We currently have 7 pending warns, 200+ pending bans, and 15 suspension/firings pending on the Management Board. I'm gonna work on clearing suspensions and firings, but there's quite a few of you online so if you could please help, that'd be great. GMs, now might be a nice chance to host a quick banning session for seniors.

@High Rank So I got this suggestion a few days ago, what do you all think on us archiving the old Hotel Log and adding a new along with a Session Log?

i dont see a point since seniors log their session too


[03-Feb-20 05:45 PM] ethan;#0003
no managers went to the hotel


[03-Feb-20 05:45 PM] ethan;#0003
because they all thought the more sessions they go to, the higher chance they have of being promoted


[03-Feb-20 05:45 PM] ethan;#0003
so it was shutdown on the last day of 2017


[03-Feb-20 05:45 PM] ethan;#0003
and changed to hotel log


[03-Feb-20 05:45 PM] ethan;#0003
because managers would never go to the hotel


[03-Feb-20 05:45 PM] ethan;#0003
and with this they feel like they need to now

[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] Polk#1596
yeah for a spoon right?


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
from his child protective services thing


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
and he hates me


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
HE GAVE ME MORE TIME IN JAIL WHEN I WAS ALREADY IN JAIL


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
for buying his shirt


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
I WAS OUT IN 30 SECONDS


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
THEN I GOT 8 MORE MINS


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmm


[03-Feb-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
What if we just trial it then? @ethan;


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
Do like a 2-week trial


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
See how it goes


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
can we try keeping the hotel log, and adding the other one


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
And the log would be two separate cards so we can see which is being used more


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
so they have both?


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ya


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
that would probaly work also


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
That was my plan, Hotel Log and then a Session Log


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
OH


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
i thought you meant, get rid of session log


[03-Feb-20 05:49 PM] Polk#1596

@High Rank hi. for tickets when you are doing the talkative role ones, if you close a card for the account not meeting the 30 day age requirement, you can put "-close "Account does not meet 30 day age requirement" the recipient who created the card, gets a DM with the close reason when the card is closed by an admin. You do not need to wait for the person to reply to create it. also, if someone creates a card and gives no subject and when you get to the card, its blank, just close it, that is basicly like the DM rule, we dont reply if they they dont give a question or something in that area. Also, when you move the cards to the suggestion category, you are supposed to put the suggestion on the HR board.

[03-Feb-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435
r we gonna question her


[03-Feb-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435
or no


[03-Feb-20 06:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we suspend her then yes, but i dont see why we really need to question her cause like she admitted to someone else having access to her account


[03-Feb-20 06:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
i feel confident with an instant fire based on our current evidence


[03-Feb-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
tbh the whole thing is rly confusing


[03-Feb-20 06:40 PM] bman#0435
but alex explained to me that she thinks someone had the account and worked at frappe and dian was given the account to kee activity up but resigned and joined bloxton


[03-Feb-20 06:40 PM] bman#0435
which is still account sharing


[03-Feb-20 06:40 PM] bman#0435
but confusing


[03-Feb-20 06:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
from what i see, diana has apparently gave her account to someone else, whether that's true or not idk

but, this is our number one piece of evidence which we can basically fire her with: https://gyazo.com/86321bff480b3e074567ce3a3c19f1f0

UHJIMMY + UHFLEZENT EXPOSED.
They deserved to get exposed long ago. They ruin the community piece by piece by killing and copying groups. This situation was extremely stressful for me. Please spread the word, don't let uhFlezent's Lime get popular. 


I didn't want to make this.

And I have heard of uhJimmy


[03-Feb-20 08:54 PM] ethan;#0003
he has a very bad reputation, he used to be the co owner at Solonas Resort but got fired then copied the group


[03-Feb-20 08:54 PM] ethan;#0003
and he copied a ton of groups with Flezent


[03-Feb-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh boy


[03-Feb-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Not sure what to do other than:


[04-Feb-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) Unsuspend her


[04-Feb-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
B) Extend her suspension due to this incident


[04-Feb-20 12:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
C) Possible termination??


[04-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
literally 3 people complained to me that announcing stacey and trey's birthdays "isn't fair" unless we do it for everyone


[04-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
and we're being rude to those who aren't HRs


[04-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
like do an HR's job for 3 days and tell me you do 1/20th of the stuff we do before complaining bitches

[04-Feb-20 12:48 PM] emma;#1525
wow she wasn't hacked


[04-Feb-20 12:48 PM] emma;#1525
who woulda guessed


[04-Feb-20 12:48 PM] emma;#1525
🙄


[04-Feb-20 12:48 PM] emma;#1525
oh wait


[04-Feb-20 12:48 PM] emma;#1525
me


[04-Feb-20 12:48 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey we can't terminate her for not being hacked, and the stuff she did wasn't even termination worthy


[04-Feb-20 12:49 PM] emma;#1525
she's been suspended for a super long time now so she either needs to be unsuspended or given an actual timed suspension to serve for her not super mature behavior (which i think is bs bc she was clearly just trying to joke around but y'all love suspending people so)


[04-Feb-20 12:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll ask minn to unsuspend perhaps


[04-Feb-20 12:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
By the way


[04-Feb-20 12:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Are you ready for tomorrow @emma;

[04-Feb-20 01:42 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[04-Feb-20 01:42 PM] emma;#1525
that's awkward


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] emma;#1525
no that was on purpose then


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] emma;#1525
bc auto correct doesn't chance "btw" to a curse word


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] emma;#1525
and kelly KNOWS that


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] stacey#1000
What course word was it even


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] bman#0435
btw=curse word dictionary


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] emma;#1525
i have no idea


[04-Feb-20 01:43 PM] emma;#1525

I’m just gonna tell her she unfortunately has to wait a month to appeal like everyone else and to double check messages before sending them


[04-Feb-20 01:44 PM] emma;#1525
tell her that she shouldn't have set her phone to autocorrect "btw" to a curse word


[04-Feb-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
I asked her when she was banned


[04-Feb-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
Jan 29th


[04-Feb-20 01:44 PM] emma;#1525
because the only way that can happen is if you manually set it up like that


[04-Feb-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[04-Feb-20 01:47 PM] stacey#1000
Told her she can appeal on the 29th


[04-Feb-20 01:47 PM] stacey#1000
Never heard that excuse of auto correct before


[04-Feb-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh I remember this


[04-Feb-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; Omg did people seriously complain over that announcement. Wowwwwww


[04-Feb-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll rage if they complain tomorrow for yours


[04-Feb-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
Like no


[04-Feb-20 01:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
U can change something in settings to change a word to something else


[04-Feb-20 01:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like btw could be autocorrected in whatever you want it to


[04-Feb-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435
y does imag always put the damn suspicious people for reco

I like how short and to the point her goodbye message is


[05-Feb-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like she didn't blame Bloxton for her grades or mention that there's "toxic people"


[05-Feb-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Respect


[05-Feb-20 04:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828

@xM_inn yo what are ur thoughts on unsuspending south since it looks like she isn't hacked


[05-Feb-20 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
as long as u have proof she isnt hacked then go for it @xAfroTrey


[05-Feb-20 05:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so this is what she sent me:

[05-Feb-20 05:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't really like her attitude with this one.


[05-Feb-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If anyone has any advice, lmk.


[05-Feb-20 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
what the fuck is wrong with that girl


[05-Feb-20 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
she should just be fired at this point


[05-Feb-20 06:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bruh did she fr meme her suspension


[05-Feb-20 06:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she was definitely bold to dm that to trey lmao but not a smart move if she wants to be unsuspended


[05-Feb-20 06:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
not looking good for her rn


[05-Feb-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What are you thoughts on the next step? @¢. ღ @ethan;


[05-Feb-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd like to do something quicker rather than later.


[05-Feb-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
fire


[05-Feb-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
first she lies


[05-Feb-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
then she lies again


[05-Feb-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
then she lies again


[05-Feb-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
now she tries to make us feel bad for her


[05-Feb-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
trey did u see what i said


[05-Feb-20 06:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah.


[05-Feb-20 06:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
tbh id probably say unsuspend and see where it goes from there, if she continues to act up we could consider harsher consequences


[05-Feb-20 06:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
thats just my opinion tho


[05-Feb-20 06:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
@xM_inn wbu what r ur thoughts


[05-Feb-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I got kind of pissed of what she did lol @¢. ღ


[05-Feb-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is what i said:


[05-Feb-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
> xAfroTreyToday at 7:18 PM
> Did you just meme your suspension-
> xAfroTreyToday at 7:26 PM
> Okay, I'm going to be real with you on this one, that is NOT a good way to handle suspension. As I've said last time, you seem to be playing a risky game at the moment. Look, I get that there's different ways to cope with your situation, but DO NOT EVER sent content like this in my DMs when you're being punished.


[05-Feb-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't see this until I scrolled up further.


[05-Feb-20 06:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah what she did was really immature, you replied the right way


[05-Feb-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I was getting a lot of birthday wishes, so it was really hard to navigate.


[05-Feb-20 06:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
lol watch her be like "its funny tho"


[05-Feb-20 06:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Feb-20 06:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[05-Feb-20 06:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Feb-20 06:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Feb-20 06:40 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

Bloxton Hotels | Helper Guides [ ALL RANKS ] Created by Kenzi.
Bloxton Hotels Helper Guides  [ ALL RANKS PROVIDED ]   ♡ Hi! This is a document with all the helper guides provided for LR/MRs who are in need of a helper guide in their training session! I have put many questions for each rank so you can have a play about with all the diff...

Ummm she defo shoulda asked first


[06-Feb-20 01:58 AM] emma;#1525
Maybe we should make an announcement about how MRs need perms to make BH docs


[06-Feb-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey south has been suspended for like two weeks so either remove her suspension or fire her


[06-Feb-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
It shouldn’t be taking this long


[06-Feb-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
Just make a choice lol


[06-Feb-20 07:46 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
since her behavior hasn't been the best on suspension, I'd say demote to lr as well @xAfroTrey


[06-Feb-20 07:47 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
also managements seem to think helpers need guides?


[06-Feb-20 07:47 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
lmao when I first became a helper I had no guide


[06-Feb-20 07:47 AM] ¢. ღ#0666

[06-Feb-20 01:33 PM] ethan;#0003
@High Rank thoughts on written warning Lyoo for two days for being beyond rude. I have also noticed the past month a major increase in how rude the MRs are to other mrs, Lrs, and HRs. I think there needs to be an annoncement about how to properly behave.

[06-Feb-20 01:38 PM] ethan;#0003
If not then he needs a written warning


[06-Feb-20 01:40 PM] ethan;#0003
@bman @¢. ღ I changed the tag to a warning


[06-Feb-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; o ok. ill monitor him before voting but tbh ive been seeing disrespect and attitude


[06-Feb-20 01:47 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah if he keeps it up, ill vote too


[06-Feb-20 01:47 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hopefully we wont have anymore issues like this with him


[06-Feb-20 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Feb-20 01:47 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[06-Feb-20 01:47 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
rly?


[06-Feb-20 01:48 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hes acted like this before?


[06-Feb-20 01:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
That apology has so many abbreviations it doesn’t seem like he actually means he’s sorry


[06-Feb-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
i agree wit cookie


[06-Feb-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
the “xx🥺” doesnt make it seem like a legit apology and is only saying it so u like him lol


[06-Feb-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
mrs message me in interviews for telling me low account ages for some reason and one messaged me "this person is only 44 days old"


[06-Feb-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
BRUH WHATTT


[06-Feb-20 02:56 PM] bman#0435
i dont like how they kick the low account ages without even telling us


[06-Feb-20 02:56 PM] bman#0435
like they literally could have kicked a cb without telling us and we wont be able to question and ban


[06-Feb-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
Suspend. No MRs should ever disrespect anyone. Just as we wouldn’t.


[06-Feb-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
And yes I agree with an announcement.


[06-Feb-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
Disappointing to see this behaviour.


[06-Feb-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
someone asked in questions if management can see deleted messages and he responded with "You don't need to know, you aren't Management."


[06-Feb-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Omg


[06-Feb-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll legit write an announcement


[06-Feb-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Not post it of course


[06-Feb-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Without approval


[06-Feb-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Or enough votes


[06-Feb-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
But I’m mad annoyed


[06-Feb-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
At how many MRs disrespect even LRs

!!!


[06-Feb-20 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; you can scare all the MRs cause we might need an announcement for all of them to see on their rude behaviour lol


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] stacey#1000
Well it’s not all MRs


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
what are the specific problems we're seeing


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yes Nice pfp


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] stacey#1000
Well here is an example


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] stacey#1000
earlier


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
also this kid who owns "pablo" or whatever is telling me about some exploiter that works for us


[06-Feb-20 04:23 PM] stacey#1000
In questions someone asked if managers could see deleted messages right


[06-Feb-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
and when i didn't immediately promise to solve the problem said "You don't care." so now im roasting him


[06-Feb-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
oops


[06-Feb-20 04:24 PM] stacey#1000
And a manager responded with “you’re not a manager, you don’t need to know”


[06-Feb-20 04:24 PM] stacey#1000
Like that’s rude


[06-Feb-20 04:24 PM] stacey#1000
Like genuinely their behaviour sometimes to LRs is rude


[06-Feb-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
yeah that's rude


[06-Feb-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
They seem to act like just because they are MRs they are better


[06-Feb-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Le_Grx sent in an appeal for the former role, I'll copy and paste it below. Please vote on it yes or no.

Secondly, I'll scare the MRs into better behavior via a staff announcement. If y'all have specific examples of staff behaving poorly that I can use to help scare them, please let me know :) or if there's anything else you think needs to be stated


[06-Feb-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
The appeal: My role was removed because I acted extremely immature during my holidays by trying to bypass the swearing filter and was warned by bot. I believe I should get my role back because I’ve been a MR here at Hilton for a time and always promised to be a help for this group. I have been re-applying and working hard because I put passion towards this group. I should also get it back because I’ve been a changed person and became mature. I’ve been waiting for a moment and sincerely apologies for this foolish behaviour.

But again


[06-Feb-20 04:30 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
I want to look more into who he is


[06-Feb-20 04:30 PM] stacey#1000

Hello, my name is EmmaPendragon and I am an HR (Shift Manager) at your ally Bloxton Hotels. Recently, our HR team has been made aware that Hxarriett, a former cb and long time tormentor of my staff members, has been hired as a trainee MR at SizzleBurger. For over 6 months, Harriet made at least 200 accounts to bypass her server bans for trolling, harassed our staff members, stalked HRs and MRs into games, and got staff members fired by pressuring them into leaking sensitive information to her. There are folders upon folders that my team has on her, if you would like proof of any incidents. This behavior went on through December 2019 and into January, meaning it's still very recent. While she has been quiet the past few weeks, the Bloxton HR team still has concerns that she is concealing her true mentality from SizzleBurger and may end up doing the same to you. As our ally, we would heavily appreciate your HR team looking into this situation, and hopefully removing her from her trainee MR rank, as she is considered one of Bloxton's biggest "nemeses" given her months of ban worthy, if not evil, behavior.

I hope that this matter is looked into as it is of great importance to us and we consider SizzleBurger to be an amazing and loyal ally. Thank you in advance, and please contact me or xM_inn if you have questions or would like to see any proof of Harriet's actions.


[06-Feb-20 05:10 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn is that ok


[06-Feb-20 05:10 PM] emma;#1525
gonna draft up a staff announcement here so can't respond for a second so just let me know lol


[06-Feb-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
if i title it "A Letter on Not Being an A$$hole" is that too aggressive (the announcement, not the letter to sb)


[06-Feb-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
**Disappointing Behavior.**

Recently the HR team has noticed a lot of very disappointing, and sometimes disgusting, behavior and attitudes from people on the MR team. I could list every example but I'll run out of a word count, but it ranges anywhere from starting stupid arguments in staff lounge to sassing people in general discussion to flat out saying "You aren't an MR so you don't get to know" to people in questions.

I'm sorry, did I make a new rule allowing people to be entitled brats in this server? I thought we raised you a bit better than this.

I know it's considered "cool" by some children (Yes, children) to have an elitist attitude since you're in a small position of power, but if you aren't mature enough to handle it and treat people with *respect* and **kindness** then instead of writing a resignation letter after a long, fulfilling career, you can explain to people how you were terminated because you were rude to guests and LRs for no reason.

That sounds harsh, but so is a lot of behavior I've been seeing lately. I've been a member of the Bloxton MR/HR team for over **3** years now and I've never seen this much bad behavior. You guys don't get to act like the kings and queens of the world because you are an MR, just like HRs don't get to either (we're called out on it constantly and are always discussing how we can improve ourselves, so don't think I'm not just as hard on these HRs as I am on you guys).

There will be a **zero** tolerance policy for rude, petty, elitist behavior on our server and in DMs when dealing with Bloxton issues from now on. We've been very generous with warnings lately, but if the situation warrants a suspension we will hand one out without a warning proceeding it. Our reputation cannot and will not be tarnished because some of you don't know how to act.

Thank you to the many members of our team who haven't had an issue with this. You are not on a bad list. We appreciate you and your good behavior so much.

[06-Feb-20 08:22 PM] bman#0435
so i check her chatlogs


[06-Feb-20 08:23 PM] bman#0435
and she was acting like a victim of cyberbullying by calling people out for ignoring her "in the circle" and made her new friend color, who support a racist "joke" at my session but was warned because it was super super minor and wasnt the one to make the "joke"


[06-Feb-20 08:23 PM] bman#0435
and i was like "so shes THIS girl"


[06-Feb-20 08:23 PM] bman#0435

and i do a last call for retrainers


[06-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435

[06-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
and i say its far too late to retrain


[06-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
and i politely ask her to go back to the security lane


[06-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
and she argues with me


[06-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
but i kept telling her the same things


[06-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
so she goes back to the security line


[06-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
then she comes up to me and asks to retrain for bar


[06-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
i tell her its far too late to retrain


[06-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
again


[06-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
and she goes back to security


[06-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
so drew finished naming at this point, and hes ready to kick excess


[06-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
she then decided to go back to the staff line and not retrain


[06-Feb-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
and at that point shes pissing me off, so i tell her to go back onto the line since drew already picked helpers and trainers


[06-Feb-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
and she goes back


[06-Feb-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
drew kicks excess


[06-Feb-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
i release staff and trainees

@High Rank so I just got proof on nightgems being involved with crystal, nothing super huge just proof that night wanted to OD her. Just thought I'd pass it on, let me know opinions.

@High Rank I’m going to be busy all day so I need some of you to coordinate a folder or document with proof on Harriet and send it to Death1y (the Sb HR) so they can investigate and potentially terminate her


[07-Feb-20 09:28 AM] emma;#1525
It shouldn’t take long since she’s made a million accounts lol


[07-Feb-20 09:28 AM] emma;#1525

[07-Feb-20 09:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

@High Rank (prob last ping for the day but I will keep pinging y’all until I feel like stuff is being done lol) 1. Last chance to vote on Le_Grx’s appeal, I tagged all of you yesterday and only 2 have voted. If we don’t reach 5 votes I’ll decide myself so pls don’t complain lol. 2. Trey agreed to make a document on Harriet but I need all of you to help since everyone has different proof. Unless you are okay with her being an MR at our ally, there is no reason not to assist. I will be upset if I come back from class after begging you guys to help 3 times now and nothing has been done yet. Please don’t make me do it all on my own in a hurry tonight between meetings. 

Trey won’t be back for a couple hours so if someone else wants to make a doc and share it please go ahead, we have an HR folder for this exact reason now.

[08-Feb-20 09:09 AM] xM_inn#2821
she resigned


[08-Feb-20 09:09 AM] bman#0435

[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
kinda out of our control now


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] stacey#1000
She resigned


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
like 10 mins ago


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] bman#0435
i checked her group roles like 20 mins-


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] bman#0435
.


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] stacey#1000
So yeah we can’t do anything then


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] bman#0435
she knew it mustve been coming lmao


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
she said at the start of that video shes resigning


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] stacey#1000
All we can do now is blacklist is if she does anything else


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
did she do anything major? i only watched the first few minutes


[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] bman#0435

[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] bman#0435

[08-Feb-20 09:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
oh okay


[08-Feb-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
We can’t blacklist for that


[08-Feb-20 09:11 AM] bman#0435
and falsely kicked someone


[08-Feb-20 09:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
well, maybe she just wanted to spend her last shift hanging with friends, can't really blame her right?


[08-Feb-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
So yeah can’t do anything now


[08-Feb-20 09:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
either way


[08-Feb-20 09:11 AM] xM_inn#2821

@High Rank last call, if you have ANY photos of Harriet cbing, bypsssing, be rude, etc pls send them to trey so he can add them to his doc and send it to the SB HR team. Everyone has a duty to help send stuff in unless you’re okay with Harriet being an MR at our ally. Ty and I’ll stop harassing soon


[08-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435

since she has left us alone for awhile


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
trey tried talking to them about swan


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525

[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435

[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
card on hr board


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
If she got 6 votes that’s a fire lol


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
No need to ask


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
k but whos firing lol


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
im not home at all today


[08-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
so


[08-Feb-20 02:15 PM] bman#0435
btw trey can search up “Harriet” on manager and hr board and LOTS coem uo


[08-Feb-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
ya ik and he has a lot of that proof too


[08-Feb-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
but the more the better


[08-Feb-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
like if we can get 100 photos that would seal the deal lol


[08-Feb-20 02:18 PM] bman#0435
just search up her 5k accounts on mb 😌


[08-Feb-20 02:18 PM] bman#0435
i just wanna say that if she finds out we got her fired then the possibilities of her coming back to troll are SUPER high


[08-Feb-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
yeah well i dont think it's okay for her to be an MR at our ally


[08-Feb-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
under any circumstances


[08-Feb-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn in this report to sb, it would be a lot easier to show how many alts harriet has if I can screenshot the search results. technically that's "leaking" so let me know if that's an okay thing to do or not and send it to sb lol


[08-Feb-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525

@emma; u can, but cover the name of the trello stuff


[08-Feb-20 03:00 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; she just got promoted to the "trainee mr" role, so she has no power rn but if she gets promoted again she'll be a real MR


[08-Feb-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435

@High Rank vacr0n seems to think he can control alliance visits apparently. he wqs using :h messages to talk to them, using countdowns, and sitting others without permission. :yes: for suspension :yesblob: for warning

[08-Feb-20 03:36 PM] emma;#1525
If he’s been  suspended that many times should we consider termination?


[08-Feb-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe but I think the rule is for each rank if I'm not mistaken

@Polk hi uh should we also be concerned over the fact that cory didnt report it


[08-Feb-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000

staceyToday at 5:09 PM
Please keep in mind lying about being a head of security and saying you lost your rank by leaving the group, trying to attain a head rank will only get you into consequences and lower your chances for a promotion. This is a warning, do not lie about being any MR rank to try and obtain an MR rank, any HR you message will see through it.


[08-Feb-20 04:10 PM] bman#0435
considering he is a higher rank than saab but she ended up reporting instead of cory


[08-Feb-20 04:10 PM] bman#0435

Greetings, VACR0N.

It has come to the HR team's attention that you have minorly admin abused and acted as if you were in control of the entire server in a public hotel server during an alliance visit. This could have negatively affected our reputation and our relationship with Boba. You may use the H command for shouts to attract attention to the guests for Bar and Housekeeping, however, you may not use such a command to order those around in a circumstance like this. Due to these actions, you will be suspended from your position for five days. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask any member of the HR team!

Best regards,

_blissuh_

[09-Feb-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
He cant expect you to cancel all your plans when he randomly appears


[09-Feb-20 11:43 AM] Polk#1596
and i mean like sure i do want to talk to him as well, but just because im busy doesnt mean he can say i have a lack of communication like wth

[09-Feb-20 11:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
Seniors aren't complaining and all of them are being reviewed on time


[09-Feb-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
It creates more work for us and seniors


[09-Feb-20 11:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
And it also brings us more trainees


[09-Feb-20 11:46 AM] stacey#1000

@xAfroTrey do u know why jacks honour member role was taken


[09-Feb-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
i swear, if the fizze owner spent as much time working on developing their V2 as much as he does teasing and annoying people about the release, it'd probably be released by now


[09-Feb-20 12:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wha


[09-Feb-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435

[09-Feb-20 12:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@High Rank Opitral (A former MR also known as cosmicvibezz), was banned from the Discord server due to doxing Saab_ii in a former chat. For those curious, she will be having no appeals permitted since this is her second time being banned. Please let me know if you need any proof.

@Cooqkie look what I wrote on Saab’s thing too


[09-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I read dat a few mins ago


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like I get wut u mean but


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think that


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
We would lose  a lot of MRs


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
From making them managers


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc I don’t think they rly understand


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
That they aren’t being favored


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And I think that


[09-Feb-20 09:54 PM] bman#0435
@¢. ღ can i do it rn since i need to sleep soon


[09-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
By promoting them to managers the managers rn might feel sort of threatened by them bc they think they’re being favored when they’re not


[09-Feb-20 09:55 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
@bman yes


[09-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like I don’t have a problem with them being promoted but bc of that idk


[09-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think if we do promote them


[09-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
We make an announcement about formers and them not being favored or something


[09-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc I don’t think some of the MRs rly understand that


[09-Feb-20 09:56 PM] a. ღ#4222
Are slee Saab and Tate up for a promo


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
not tate I think


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
ngl i feel like they act like theyre hrs half of the time


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
OMG I FIGURED OUT A NEW HACK ON MY PHONE. IF YOH HOLD DOWN THE SPACE KEY ON MOBILE ON DISCORD YOU CAN MOVE YOUR TYPING THING TO WHEREVER YOU WANT. 

Ok sorry changing topic, I just think they’ve been heads over 2 months now. Like how long do they have to be a head to get promoted again as a former...? Legit look at all our heads we have rn. We don’t have a lot. We promoted a lot to manager and the rest are newer than them  and then there are a few inactive


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wha


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wut u mean move the typing thing


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
OMG STACEY


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
BAHAHAH


[09-Feb-20 09:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
THAT WORKS


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
I LOVE IT LOL


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
YES ITS AMAZING


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Can’t u like


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Hold down the chat area


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And do that


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
The typing curser like


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
It only works on mobile


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
Like say u typing a paragraph


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u can hold down the chat area too


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
you know back to the topic


[09-Feb-20 09:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Next to the smiley face


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think slee and Saab are great but


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think we shouldn’t promote them together


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] stacey#1000
Sorry for changing topic that was just a great new hack


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
ik I love it


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I agree with story


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
not together


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
they were promoted to head within like two days


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
might make more anger


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] stacey#1000
I’m not saying promote them all together


[09-Feb-20 09:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
Ya I’m not saying u did but if it’s gonna look ok I’m saying we should maybe just like


[09-Feb-20 10:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
Consider one at a time ?


[09-Feb-20 10:00 PM] stacey#1000
I’m saying like Saab for example, she has worked hard and is legit at hotel every day and has been head over 2 months yet being a former is being held against her...? How long does she have to be a head to get manager in your opinion?


[09-Feb-20 10:01 PM] emma;#1525
we are NOT promoting slee tate and saab rn omg


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
are y'all kiding me lol they've only been back for 3 months each


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
that is not enough time for manager


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
I don’t think the former mr is a big deal but they just can’t be promoted together


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
also my HR board isn't loading so if that's not who we're talking about sorry


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg hi emma


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
hi


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
Omg why is there so many birthdays in February


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
i think people need to be WORKING at bh for at least 4-5 months before manager, no matter what the combo of LR and head is


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont think they shud be promoted


[09-Feb-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Also


[09-Feb-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Remember when they got promoted


[09-Feb-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Alex, Megan and maybe a few others idk


[09-Feb-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Put some of us into a vc


[09-Feb-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And told us how they felt about them being promoted so quick


[09-Feb-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So I think we should consider that


[09-Feb-20 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
Yes Ik that


[09-Feb-20 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
And it’s not like we promoting them after 1 month now


[09-Feb-20 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
They’ve been head over 2 months now


[09-Feb-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
yes


[09-Feb-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
but they wer LRs for one month


[09-Feb-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
you guys tried to promote them after 2 weeks


[09-Feb-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
and didn't bc me and a few other HRs said noooo way


[09-Feb-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
there's no reason to promote people to manager after 3 months of working at BH, yes they are dedicated and yes I'd love to see them advance maybe in another month or so


[09-Feb-20 10:06 PM] bman#0435
also, again, they act like hrs sometimes


[09-Feb-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
but if they hadn't been formers they wouldn't be promoted this fast


[09-Feb-20 10:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
I feel like since they are formers they just like draw ur eye to them


[09-Feb-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
bc plenty of current heads have been active for over 3 months as an MR and aren't a manager yet


[09-Feb-20 10:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
Idk if it’s just me


[09-Feb-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
100% if slee gets promoted people will think its bc he was allowed to make that document


[09-Feb-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
i mean he got promoted to HR because he made that fake bans board lol


[09-Feb-20 10:07 PM] stacey#1000
Look at all our heads rn


[09-Feb-20 10:07 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying we have been promoting a handful to manager


[09-Feb-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
Already


[09-Feb-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
bruh that takes me back to when yall felt the need to have 60 managers


[09-Feb-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
5 managers in every damn trianing server


[09-Feb-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
We legit are not ignoring the other heads...


[09-Feb-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
and here i am struggling to have 1


[09-Feb-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
The other heads that deserved manager and were there longer have been promoted. Like Armani today for example.


[09-Feb-20 10:10 PM] emma;#1525
okay that doesn't mean slee saab and tate deserve it because they're "the next oldest" which i don't think is true anyways...?


[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg ikr beanman


[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] bman#0435
first i was the 100th head recep


[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
I’m not saying promote based on who’s been there longer


[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg armi got promoted to manager today?


[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] bman#0435
then i was one of the 60 managers


[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] bman#0435

[09-Feb-20 10:11 PM] bman#0435

[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey if you had to pick ONE to promote (bc there is no way they've all done the exact same amount of activity) who would you pick


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
Saab, that’s who I’m talking about


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435
i would pick tate tbh


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think Tate is active too


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
same


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435
hes more loose


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya I would pick tate too


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
Tate yes


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
I added him today for a reason


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
I was quite surprised that Tate wasn’t on the board with them


[09-Feb-20 10:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
sry but I don’t rly see slEE


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
Cause I think he’s the most active


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Slee*


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
Because legit every day for past week he’s been asking me to go to hotel to ban people


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk y my iPad autocorrect slee to that


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
Ya he asks me too


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
And I do it !!!


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Same


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] bman#0435
i would pick tate and vote, but i just think its a early for ME personally to vote


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
Woo active !!


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
Saab does similar thing tho so hard to say really


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
👏


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
ok so we all agree there's no reason for slee to be on the promo list


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I see tate more


[09-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
and he was only added to keep the trio together bc we see them as a package deal


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
essentially


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Tate’s not up there tho?


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
tate is now


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
I legit agree with Saab


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
all three are


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
I added Tate


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
Tbh if anyone I see Tate the most


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
that's fair stacey


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya I see tate the most


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
im saying slee was added bc of our bias towards that trio


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
which was my whole point


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
about them


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Also I think tate is like


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Well


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
that a lot of the HRs are biased towards them


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Acts the least like an hr to me


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Personally


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk what u guys think tho


[09-Feb-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
thats bc tate is the least mature lol

o


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think he has a maturity *issue* but he's not the most mature


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
which isn't necessarily a reason not to promote


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
but just a thought


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
he seems fine to me


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk I feel like


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Saab might be 2 mature


[09-Feb-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya know


[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
i mean saab is 24 or 25


[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
not sure which one


[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Whaaaaaaat

[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
😳


[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
saab is mature but the whole guest issue always makes me wary


[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
like she let herself be gaslighted for a loooong time even tho all her friends tried to help her out of it


[09-Feb-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
she's a lot better now thankfully


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
but she was 22 and in an online relationship


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
and helped a guy fake his death


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What’s gaslighted mean


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
essentially


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
basically controlled


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
without realizing it


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435

[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435

that was my point


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
tyvm


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
idk my personal history with tate and saab are always gonna make me a bit wary about both of them but i dont want to hold that against them forever


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What did tate do


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
him and guest were bffs


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
and he defended him to the end of the earth


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
well


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
didn't listen to me or anyone else


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
got mad when we brought up how fake it seemed


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
etc


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
etc


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so I unvoted for slee since I don’t see him as much as before and I see your point but I still really agree for Tate since I added him today and I still agree for Saab. Just my opinion


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
oh boy


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
if i can pick 1 i wud take tate


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I was gonna say I was friends with guest but I wouldn’t protect him to the end of the earth so


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
slee and saab no


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
I wasn’t even friends with any of them


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
i was too and i did defend guest at first when he told me he had cancer bc i had no reason to not believe him


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
If anything Saab was my friend


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
but then it got very obvious very quickly that it was fake


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[09-Feb-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-Feb-20 10:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But then after he lied about that


[09-Feb-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000

[09-Feb-20 10:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809

Ikr @bman


[09-Feb-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
saying that out of the three i'd pick tate doesn't mean i want him promoted *rn* but it means if he keeps up his short-term activity for another month then i'd be more comfortable considering it


[09-Feb-20 10:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-Feb-20 10:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The soccer team gets houses


[09-Feb-20 10:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they live together in houses


[09-Feb-20 10:33 PM] emma;#1525
ik but most colleges require freshman and sophomores to live on campus


[09-Feb-20 10:34 PM] emma;#1525
but sometimes sports team houses are counted as "on campus" housing so it doesnt matter


[09-Feb-20 10:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think they let freshman live in the houses


[09-Feb-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000

He's been an alcoholic for 10 years now and this was my final straw


[09-Feb-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey ik it sucks that you have to go through that at all but i think filing a report is a step in the right direction


[09-Feb-20 11:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We are


[09-Feb-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525
its not fair for you and your mom to have to endure that from him, and if that means potentially getting the police involved that's better then an alternative


[09-Feb-20 11:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We had the cops show up and he cursed at them

[10-Feb-20 12:08 PM] stacey#1000
Are they all in the server?


[10-Feb-20 12:08 PM] stacey#1000
Isn’t Tate an MR rn though...?


[10-Feb-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000
How would he be in a “former mr only” chat thing


[10-Feb-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000
We’ll be is a former too


[10-Feb-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000
So it’s basically like a former trash talk server


[10-Feb-20 12:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nonono


[10-Feb-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-Feb-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000

[10-Feb-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
But it’s like a former trash talk server tho right


[10-Feb-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-Feb-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000

Good evening, dianIyn.

It has come the my attention that you have participated in the acts of sharing your account with another individual. Do note that the MR team has been warned about the consequences of account sharing under many different circumstances upon many different times. We stated that if individuals are caught sharing their account with others, it would lead to an instant termination. Your actions have deemed you with a termination of your current role. You will be ranked from Management down to Hotel Guest upon receiving this letter. It saddens me to let you go. If you have any questions or concerns about your termination, please do not hesitate to get back to me or another HR. Thank you for your time and for what you have done for Bloxton.

Dear dianIyn,

The HR team has become aware that you are or have shared your account with someone during your time as an MR. As you are aware, we terminate any staff members found to do this due to the security risks. Unfortunately this means that you are being released from your position as a Management today. If you have any questions about this, please do not hesitate to ask me or another HR. I hope you learn from this mistake going forward, should you choose to pursue a career somewhere else.

[10-Feb-20 09:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3 day suspension


[10-Feb-20 09:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's my pick


[10-Feb-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
i mean, our rules dont rly say anything against the gif but its common sense not to post it


[10-Feb-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
considering sl isnt as strict upon rules


[10-Feb-20 09:35 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
the only thing we rly allow is swearing but to a respectful limit in sl


[10-Feb-20 09:35 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they still gotta follow the server rules


[10-Feb-20 09:35 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but they think theyre invincible for some reason

**Checklist Reviews**

> Every Monday, Min will review each activity checklist and comment the checklist scores of each High-Rank. All activity for the previous week must be logged prior to Min reviewing the checklists. All activity for the following week must be logged once Min has reviewed the checklists. Keep note of this to avoid confusing when logging your activity on Mondays.


[11-Feb-20 08:13 AM] bman#0435
im getting ready for managers to fake log stuff or log stuff incorrectly e.e

They try to log as much as they can because they think they will be promoted


[11-Feb-20 08:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Uh


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Y do they log everything in one comment


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] ethan;#0003
You mean why don’t


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Huh


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Is she logging everything she does


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Like if she does one exploiter report


[11-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Just logging the singular exploiter report


[11-Feb-20 08:44 AM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn there needs to be a clarification on what and how@much you can@log


[11-Feb-20 08:45 AM] ethan;#0003
@Polk


[11-Feb-20 08:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
they are confused


[11-Feb-20 08:45 AM] ethan;#0003
They are rushing


[11-Feb-20 08:45 AM] ethan;#0003
Trying to do as many as they can


[11-Feb-20 08:46 AM] ethan;#0003
Because they think more logs = promotion


[11-Feb-20 08:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ho ho


[11-Feb-20 08:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[11-Feb-20 08:47 AM] ethan;#0003
Session logs existed in 2027


[11-Feb-20 08:47 AM] ethan;#0003
2016-17


[11-Feb-20 08:47 AM] ethan;#0003
And was closed


[11-Feb-20 08:48 AM] ethan;#0003
Because people would go to sessions just to log


[11-Feb-20 08:48 AM] ethan;#0003
And all they would care about was logging


[11-Feb-20 08:48 AM] ethan;#0003
And they would never go to the hotel


[11-Feb-20 08:48 AM] ethan;#0003
So it was changed to shift logs

@xM_inn


[11-Feb-20 09:07 AM] Cooqkie#2809
What if we did different lists for everything


[11-Feb-20 09:07 AM] Cooqkie#2809
One for sessions, shifts, and one for reports


[11-Feb-20 09:07 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Might make it less confusing

@xM_inn you shoulda given us a heads up before doing this


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] emma;#1525
bc everyone was confused


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
bruh emma


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
I did a while ago emma..


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i forgot to ask u this on ur birthday but


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
I literally did a vote


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what did you get


[11-Feb-20 09:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
So dont start that


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think she means managements


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
not us


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] emma;#1525
i mean i meant us bc i dont remember a vote, i believe you did it but clearly no one was prepared since mack was trying to answer questions and everyone got more confused


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] emma;#1525
and ur announcement made people confused too


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] emma;#1525
not my fault lol


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[11-Feb-20 09:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
everyone didnt know wat was going on


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] emma;#1525
actually wait having managers do activity cards like seniors was literally my idea


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
😬


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] emma;#1525
this just wasn't how i thought you would try to implement it bc it's kinda hectic lol


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye 3 different cards


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that sounds messy


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i thought it was personalised ones


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
like seniors and hrs


[11-Feb-20 09:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
Were not doing manager checklists


[11-Feb-20 09:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
Too many managers


[11-Feb-20 09:16 AM] emma;#1525
dont we only have like


[11-Feb-20 09:16 AM] emma;#1525
30


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
lemme see


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] emma;#1525
28


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] emma;#1525
i just counted


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
36*


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] emma;#1525
that's not honestly a lot, and if they only have a few requirements then it wouldn't be hard


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] emma;#1525
we could also set them up differently than seniors too


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
if thye only have


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
2 sessions


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
20 reports


[11-Feb-20 09:17 AM] emma;#1525
or we can keep having it be a free for all with logging


[11-Feb-20 09:18 AM] emma;#1525
which is already hectic


[11-Feb-20 09:18 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
1 hour at hotel


[11-Feb-20 09:18 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn i cant find ur announcement to vote on this


[11-Feb-20 09:18 AM] emma;#1525
when was it


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
3rd feb 2020..

So I got this suggestion a few days ago, what do you all think on us archiving the old Hotel Log and adding a new along with a Session Log?

And u also literally agreed on the idea


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] emma;#1525
IT WAS MY IDEA


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] emma;#1525
LMAO


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] emma;#1525
that's why


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
No it wasn't..


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] emma;#1525
i told you management cards would be nice and you agreed saying, and I quote, "Manager activity cards could be nice"


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
yes it was-


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
it was


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] emma;#1525
on 1/23/20


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
They're not manager activity cards


[11-Feb-20 09:20 AM] emma;#1525
ik but changing it was my idea lol


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] emma;#1525
idc that you took it and ran with it since it's not my job


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] xM_inn#2821
Not everything is your idea Emma


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] emma;#1525
i mean it was


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but it was her idea


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] emma;#1525
and you changed it to be something else which i just said is fine


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] emma;#1525
if you dont think cards are the best idea that's not my problem, it's your thing to run


[11-Feb-20 09:21 AM] emma;#1525
but dont say i didnt have an idea bc you forgot i brought it up and then don't like that im right about this method being sprung on the managers (and us to a certain extent) and people were confused af


[11-Feb-20 09:22 AM] emma;#1525
and your announcement you JUST posted said nothing about report logs


[11-Feb-20 09:23 AM] emma;#1525
the report logs is legit the only part no one knew what to do for bc HRs weren't prepared to answer questions bc we didn't have a heads up lol it's not a huge deal minn but telling me "dont start that" when im literally right really sucks on your part


[11-Feb-20 09:23 AM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[11-Feb-20 09:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
I never said you didn't suggest anything, I know you suggested manager activity cards, but there's a big difference between 30 activity cards and a couple of new logging cards.. instead of being childish over your "idea being stolen" which isn't even correct, instead why don't you appreciate something, give improvement ideas & suggestions for the cards, and stop complaining at me for trying to do something nice


[11-Feb-20 09:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
make love not war


[11-Feb-20 09:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She wasn't being childish-


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Look man


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
Trey, don't continue it. Just don't.


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think maybe you might be in a bad mood at the moment but that's just me


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wasn't continuing anything


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You didn't let me finish my sentence


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] emma;#1525
minn i literally said THREE TIMES that idc you changed my idea to something you thought was better


[11-Feb-20 09:44 AM] emma;#1525
that is NOT me being childish


[11-Feb-20 09:45 AM] emma;#1525
you, however, berated me for complaining that we didn't have a heads up on the new system, sent me a copy of the announcement you made which didn't even have ANYTHING about the reports log


[11-Feb-20 09:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but


[11-Feb-20 09:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have to disagree here


[11-Feb-20 09:45 AM] emma;#1525
and yet somehow I'm supposed to know about it without you saying anything, and when I bring it up you treat me like jack and say "dont start this?"


[11-Feb-20 09:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
So report logs are something new I thought of, why all the negativity when I was only trying to do something nice?


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] emma;#1525
it's not that, it's that i complained about us not having a heads up, and you said "you actually did so don't start this"


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] emma;#1525
when we didn't


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] emma;#1525
you told me off for something that wasn't even valid


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] emma;#1525
and that's on you


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] emma;#1525
careful because that's a lot like how jack used to treat me


[11-Feb-20 09:46 AM] emma;#1525
and ik you dont want to be like him bc none of us have fond memories of him


[11-Feb-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
But I did a vote a week ago.. that's enough of a heads up in my opinion, y'all seemed fond of the idea, I didn't think it'd be a big problem if I made report logs too


[11-Feb-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
All ideas have their pros and cons, nothing is ever perfect at first


[11-Feb-20 09:47 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn your vote had NOTHING about report logs


[11-Feb-20 09:47 AM] emma;#1525
which was the thing I was complaining about


[11-Feb-20 09:47 AM] emma;#1525
and you didn't give us any updates since then about how it was supposed to work


[11-Feb-20 09:48 AM] emma;#1525
and then when everyone was complained we had to answer questions that we didn't know the exact answer on


[11-Feb-20 09:49 AM] emma;#1525
idk why you think we should automatically know how to read your mind and answer questions about a new log that you didn't give us any info on, but we tried our best to answer them


[11-Feb-20 09:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye i agree that we were given no info beforehand on the report logs


[11-Feb-20 09:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[11-Feb-20 09:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
Well it looked like you were complaining about the entire thing,

"you shoulda given us a heads up before doing this"

"ur announcement made people confused too"


[11-Feb-20 09:50 AM] emma;#1525
also the vote was a week ago, personally I would have appreciated if you'd involved us slightly on this process since I'm sure we all had slightly different ideas of what a new logging system would look like


[11-Feb-20 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
All information needed is on the Trello card, have any of you read that or did I just spend my time writing that out for nothing?


[11-Feb-20 09:50 AM] emma;#1525
or at least a "Hey this is what i want the new system to be, here's a 12 hour notice before it goes live"


[11-Feb-20 09:50 AM] emma;#1525
but that seems like too much to ask i guess since you keep telling me im stupid for not complying 100% to what you're saying


[11-Feb-20 09:50 AM] emma;#1525
even though trey and mack both agree with me


[11-Feb-20 09:50 AM] emma;#1525
but they're not being berated


[11-Feb-20 09:51 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye i would prefer a notice beforehand


[11-Feb-20 09:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
and im not sure why managers are acting confused like it's something completely new, it's literally the hotel log in two different ways


[11-Feb-20 09:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
sure, they're bound to have a few questions, but some of them are acting like it's something very new


[11-Feb-20 09:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[11-Feb-20 09:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was recently announced


[11-Feb-20 09:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
What did you think was going to happen


[11-Feb-20 09:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
it was sprung to them suddenly


[11-Feb-20 09:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not everything is going to come at them naturally


[11-Feb-20 09:53 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn They were only confused about the report logs because we've never done anything like that before


[11-Feb-20 09:53 AM] emma;#1525
and again they got more confused bc we didn't exactly know how to answer their questions


[11-Feb-20 09:53 AM] emma;#1525
because you gave us 0 info


[11-Feb-20 09:53 AM] emma;#1525
and no heads up that it was going live today


[11-Feb-20 09:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
You could've just DM'ed me..


[11-Feb-20 09:54 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
huh


[11-Feb-20 09:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You announced it fam


[11-Feb-20 09:54 AM] emma;#1525
or you could have done the decent BOD thing and given your fellow HRs a heads up and chance to ask questions in ADVANCE


[11-Feb-20 09:54 AM] emma;#1525
instead of having to take manager questions through a secondary route to your DMs


[11-Feb-20 09:55 AM] emma;#1525
i dont get why we're expected to tag HRs and BODs in everything we do to get approval or give people a chance to offer their opinions but we aren't given that same respect in turn


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait emma


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
I am literally done. There was no complaining like this in 2018. Amazing how things change in years.


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why don't you want things to be approved about


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn because no one had a fucking BACKBONE minn


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] emma;#1525
no one was willing to stand up to HRs


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
Oo there's a fight **gets phone and records**


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 welcome


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] emma;#1525
bring snacks


[11-Feb-20 09:56 AM] emma;#1525
we are hungry


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
Popcorn but not for u


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] emma;#1525
also i did complain like this in 2018 as a senior


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] emma;#1525
fun fact


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] emma;#1525
jack can confirm


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but there's going to be complaining one way or another. @xM_inn


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
Good for him


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] emma;#1525
bc he complained about it a lot


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] emma;#1525
lol


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
its starting to turn out like jack again


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You were just not in a bigger position yet.


[11-Feb-20 09:57 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn people not complaining about HR choices is probably why the 2018 team made so many that angered the MRs


[11-Feb-20 09:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, you made it to HR but, there were clearly some arguments before you made the big jump.


[11-Feb-20 09:58 AM] emma;#1525
a team in power that doesn't think about things from sides other than their own is destined to fail


[11-Feb-20 09:58 AM] emma;#1525
and if it takes an argument for you to see that you're not always 100% correct then that's fine lol i know ive been put in my place plenty of times


[11-Feb-20 09:58 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
agree


[11-Feb-20 09:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'm not speaking from my experience in 2018. @xAfroTrey


[11-Feb-20 09:59 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"I am literally done. There was no complaining like this in 2018. Amazing how things change in years."


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then what are you talking about?


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] emma;#1525
there was plenty of complaining in 2018


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] emma;#1525
and plenty in 2017


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] emma;#1525
and plenty in 2016


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
2018 was a lovely year until around November


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well uhh


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i think 2019 was the least complaining year alr


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
smh


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wouldn't say that


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
Thank you Bonnie


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] emma;#1525
bc we were all too busy with CBs LOL


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
And this isn't being continued so end of discussion. The fact is we have activity logs, if you have concerns, DM me instead.


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
huh


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn so you're saying "I'm not discussing this anymore so you can't either"


[11-Feb-20 10:00 AM] emma;#1525
essentially


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fine, but it feels like you're running away from your problems here.


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
No offense.


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye i also feel same


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] emma;#1525
because bull fucking shit jack 2.0 that's not how this works and pardon my french but this is the second time now that multiple people have tried to point things out to you and you've shut us down because you didn't like it or want to discuss it


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
Promotion week - - > change to bloxton - - > problems


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] emma;#1525
can we stop blaming all of our problems on promo week


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You also forgot that Jack existed


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] emma;#1525
because promo week wasn't why things went to shit


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] emma;#1525
HRs not listening to people's problems is what did


[11-Feb-20 10:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
everything shud come to a nice conclusion not a end of discussion idw to talk about this anymore


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] bonnie591#0591
Uh it was but ur entitled to an opinion


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] emma;#1525
promo week just caused more drama


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
thats just runnin away


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's also serenso


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] emma;#1525
but most of the arguments in SL were about HRs making choices the MRs didn't like and HRs refusing to see things from a diff perspecitve


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] bonnie591#0591
Aw man I loved asen


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let's not forget Kayla existed


[11-Feb-20 10:02 AM] emma;#1525

@bonnie591 next you'll say matt is great


[11-Feb-20 10:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; I'm saying that I'm not discussing it anymore, if you want to continue it then go ahead I guess..


[11-Feb-20 10:05 AM] xM_inn#2821
I've got other things to prioritize than arguing over something that was made to help us.


[11-Feb-20 10:05 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, you could just log off and think about what went wrong.


[11-Feb-20 10:05 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's what I would personally do.


[11-Feb-20 10:06 AM] emma;#1525
Well I juwts DMed you since that's what you requested


[11-Feb-20 10:06 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
If I'm being honest, this isn't very helpful how this is handled.


[11-Feb-20 10:06 AM] emma;#1525
And there's no point in us discussing it without you because the rest of us agree

@Bloo_Berriez you suck


[11-Feb-20 10:15 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@xM_inn I don’t really like the managers new logging system


[11-Feb-20 10:24 AM] Cooqkie#2809
What if u make everyone their own card split into 2-3 lists


[11-Feb-20 10:24 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Alphabetical


[11-Feb-20 10:24 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Like A-G


[11-Feb-20 10:24 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Extra


[11-Feb-20 10:24 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Etc*


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] ethan;#0003
Managers change their name WAY TOO MUCH


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
They could change their own card and tell us if they do


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
To their new username


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] a. ღ#4222
wait do we need to check off managers activity ?


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
no


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] a. ღ#4222
Isn’t there like thirty managers lol


[11-Feb-20 10:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
its like their shift logs


[11-Feb-20 10:26 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but theres session logs and report logs too


[11-Feb-20 10:26 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but if u split it into 3 diff lists like I said it wouldn’t be too bad

@xM_inn I feel like your not really considering our ideas to make yours better, I feel like your just like shutting down our ideas as soon as you read them instead of considering them


[11-Feb-20 10:36 AM] stacey#1000
Okay, so I understand you created the Manager thing to help us and the managers, I just don’t believe it was handled properly at all. If there was a proper discussion ahead of time with us, or a proper vote I believe that is the way it should’ve been handled. I do understand you did bring it up last week as an idea, but there was never an actual real vote or discussion afterwards. There was no heads up you were actually going to make these changes, which is why a handful of us our upset. I do feel like you are not considering our opinions as Cookie stated above. You just need to think for a quick moment and remember we are a team here, and we work together. We are not like trying to attack you, we are trying to have a simple discussion as to what happened and you are just shutting down everything we are saying and not considering anything we are saying, which being a part of team you should. A team is not a team if simple discussions can’t be held and things worked through. I suggest taking time just to calm down and really consider what we are trying to say here. We are a team and suppose to work together. @xM_inn

tbh im loving the diversity of the votes on the senior vote LOL


[11-Feb-20 12:32 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
@xM_inn for the session logs thingy do they put the main host or the senior host if a senior is hosting their server


[11-Feb-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
senior


[11-Feb-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank So, what do you think on the new logging system? Is it better? Would you prefer manager activity checklists? How can it be improved?


[11-Feb-20 12:35 PM] ethan;#0003
I think report logging should be removed


[11-Feb-20 12:35 PM] ethan;#0003
Easiest one to lie on


[11-Feb-20 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
I dont think we need logging for reports


[11-Feb-20 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
sessions log is good because its easy to know if they lie on it considering seniors take attendance and we see them


[11-Feb-20 12:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
tbh i dont mind the logging system


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
manager activity checklists would be good ngl but theres a lot of managers


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
there is


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] stacey#1000
there is a handful that are inactive tho


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
it would be a good way in seeing who is active and who isnt


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how much managers we have


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
thats true


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
36


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Like 50


[11-Feb-20 12:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that’s still quite a few, idk


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
legit there is like maybe a quater that is not actually active


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I agree


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
like x_leak


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
mhm


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
kikic01


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
for sure


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
and a lot more


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
like idk how leak is still a manager tbh


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they shouldnt be able to get by with going to one session every month tbh


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] stacey#1000
i think having a card for each manager would be good


[11-Feb-20 12:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
same


[11-Feb-20 12:39 PM] stacey#1000
it would also help us in deciding the next seniors


[11-Feb-20 12:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
OOO TRUE


[11-Feb-20 12:39 PM] stacey#1000
seeing which manager is actually doing stuff


[11-Feb-20 12:39 PM] stacey#1000
like i for one dont want to scroll on a shift card or session card just to see how many sessions 1 manager does


[11-Feb-20 12:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah just the only downside is having to check them off and there’s 36 of them.


[11-Feb-20 12:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and we can see the emilys and annas in the managers


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000
too long to scroll through all the comments


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
mhm


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000
so its either


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000
deal with scrolling through comments


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000
or have their own cards


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000
with no scrolling'


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] stacey#1000
it takes 2 seconds to check something off


[11-Feb-20 12:40 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah thats true we would have to scroll through comments a lot which is pretty irritating


[11-Feb-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
and if we do change it to that maybe shifts could be allowed to review their checklists as well considering there is a lot


[11-Feb-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000
just to help out


[11-Feb-20 12:41 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
mhm


[11-Feb-20 12:41 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
id totally be willing to help review checklists


[11-Feb-20 12:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well if we’re gonna make them cards like seniors we should make another board for that cause management is laggy as it is


[11-Feb-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
same here


[11-Feb-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
if all of us contribute to it


[11-Feb-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
then it doesnt matter how many maangers we have


[11-Feb-20 12:42 PM] katie#0200
i think cards like the seniors would be a good idea


[11-Feb-20 12:43 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeeyee


[11-Feb-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
ik this may seem like a weird idea but what if like we gave 5 managers shared a certain card to lessen being overwhelmed with so many cards


[11-Feb-20 12:43 PM] katie#0200
ehh


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] stacey#1000
that would still be a lot of scrolling


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] katie#0200
it would become messy when some resign/get promoted


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
like for example 1 card would be me bliss trey stacey and emma, another could be katie min bonnie bloo polk


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
its be the same use as logging on the card


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
but would make it less overwhelming


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] stacey#1000
the idea is to have no scrolling to see who does what


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
k well thats my idea but i gtg bcuz of comp sci


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
@stacey o


[11-Feb-20 12:44 PM] stacey#1000
ok have fun


[11-Feb-20 12:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
omg i hope we can do checklists for managers bc that would be funnnn


[11-Feb-20 12:45 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye maybe just provide the format


[11-Feb-20 12:45 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and 1 of us can do 7-8 managers


[11-Feb-20 12:45 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
or smth


[11-Feb-20 12:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yessssssssss


[11-Feb-20 12:45 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
or 5-6


[11-Feb-20 12:46 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
or to GMs


[11-Feb-20 12:46 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
so that theres training to be bod

@High Rank Add manager checklists and remove the current logging system? (Originally Emma's idea for the checklists.)

[11-Feb-20 01:43 PM] bman#0435
thats gonna be so chaotic and overwhelming


[11-Feb-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
i like the one min made, it should be very easy to use


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
im fine with what we have just dont think we need a reports logging


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
people can easily lie on it


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
they are used to hotel logs, so they should be able to log reports and sessions as well


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] bman#0435
i honestly dont see an issue with our old method of just hote logs


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
well yes, but everyone can lie cant they


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] bman#0435
we can see who reviews reports, we have attendance from seniors


[11-Feb-20 01:46 PM] bman#0435
so whats the point of those cards


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Polk#1596
we will just have to keep an eye on the comments and check sometimes if they actually did it


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Polk#1596
for example the ones with extreme activity


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What does min by checklists


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like senior checklists


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] bman#0435
ya


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] bman#0435
but for managers


[11-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How about we drive to their house just to see if they're lying


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Damn


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm a genius


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Polk#1596
@bman good point, but since hrs doesnt take attendance anymore it makes sense to have them log it


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
😎


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Polk#1596
cuz like


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Polk#1596
if a management keeps joining the first server


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Polk#1596
it will look like they arent active when we search up their username


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] bman#0435
then maybe we need a method for that


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Polk#1596
it shouldnt be a problem, it just helps us


[11-Feb-20 01:48 PM] bman#0435
instead of putting more for managers


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
what


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] bman#0435
maybe we log the mrs in our logs


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
doesnt the session log card fix that problem


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] bman#0435
not rly


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
how doesnt it


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] bman#0435
ill explain how soon but brb since i have to walk my dogs


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
now seniors dont have to log the managements anymore


[11-Feb-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
since they will have to log it themselves


[11-Feb-20 01:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hm ok


[11-Feb-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
I think report logs are gonna be weird bc they have to track their reports over a whole day


[11-Feb-20 01:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank How about we keep report logs for now and just trial it?

{Reactions}
checkmark (4) xmark 

[11-Feb-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
Sessions are already tracked bc if seniors


[11-Feb-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
But idc if we have a list for it


[11-Feb-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
Hotel log obvs stays


[11-Feb-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
not if they arent in the main server


[11-Feb-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
yes i think we should test it out


[11-Feb-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know if I sold on the idea


[11-Feb-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Seems chaotic idk


[11-Feb-20 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
i still dk if we need report logs tbh


[11-Feb-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
if they are*


[11-Feb-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
well, it doesnt hurt to try it


[11-Feb-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
if it ends up being a disaster min will just archive the card


[11-Feb-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[11-Feb-20 01:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
Personally I don’t see the reason to have the logs but I mean we can always trial it but I’m still gonna stay with my opinion


[11-Feb-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
i have a good idea/replacement for the new things so ill type it out and send it


[11-Feb-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
since i just got home fromnwalking my dogs


[11-Feb-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
**For report logs:**

Instead of Management noting down their reports for that day, instead they should make a report card, comment the reporter’s username as a REQUIREMENT instead of it being optional, and then when archived we can accurately see how many reports a management personally submits compared to the ones reviewed. If they reviewed a report, they can comment:
“Reported by:
Reviewer:” 
If they personally submit the report, they can comment:
“Reported by:”.


[11-Feb-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435
**For sessions:**

Seniors could still log their attendance, but since HRs are the main issue with the logging then maybe we can log the attendance on the HR board or on the Training Board. We can comment or put the attendance on the description of the card.


[11-Feb-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435
so ya those r my suggestions


[11-Feb-20 02:08 PM] bman#0435
@Polk ^


[11-Feb-20 02:09 PM] Polk#1596
i think we used to log them


[11-Feb-20 02:09 PM] Polk#1596
but we removed them


[11-Feb-20 02:09 PM] Polk#1596
but idk, bonnie was there not me


[11-Feb-20 02:09 PM] bman#0435
well i dont see an issue in bringing it back


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] Polk#1596
so forexample in a ban request, you want them to type the username of the reporter in the card desc?


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
ya


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
so when its archived


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] Polk#1596
well, i'd ask him why he removed it in the first place


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
and we searxh their usernames


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
we can see accurate results


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] Polk#1596
@bonnie591


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
rather than having to keep loading and scrolling and loading and scrolling and loading and scrolling


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
because the comments on the logs will only show so much at one time


[11-Feb-20 02:10 PM] Polk#1596
well um


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
so wed get inaccurate results from that


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
well if you can only log once a day


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
and we have like


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
40 managements


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
it wont be as bad as u think


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
but i get it


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
i was talking abt sessions for that


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
but for reports


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
what


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
since when did u start talking about sessions


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
i dont think they should have to keep track everyday


[11-Feb-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
k if im just confusing u then nvm


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
well idk, i think its kinda nice


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
but i think it should be a requirement to put the username of the reporter in the card desc


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
but my suggestion would make it way less chaotic and complicated


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
idk why that isnt a thing already


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
ya thats my suggestion


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
instead of logging it ok the card


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
u put reporter and reviewer


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What if we do a poll on this


[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Just an idea


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] bman#0435
a poll om what


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] bman#0435
lol


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
well


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Your suggestion actually


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
by the looks of it


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
we are going to test the reporting log thing


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
so we wont be needing a vote for it yet


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] bman#0435
also itd have to be min to conducr the poll since he is technucally the leader of the activity mdoeration


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe do it until later in it's cycle


[11-Feb-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
also trey


[11-Feb-20 02:14 PM] Polk#1596
why did u have a black pfp


[11-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
i just see my method way less complicated and chaotic


[11-Feb-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[11-Feb-20 02:14 PM] Polk#1596

[11-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that and who came


[11-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but I think u put who came as a comment or something


[11-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its not part of the title if u know what i mean


[11-Feb-20 02:38 PM] bman#0435
only hrs had access?


[11-Feb-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[11-Feb-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u would also log secondary servers


[11-Feb-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so the seniors on their normal logs would just add attendance if they dont already


[11-Feb-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc some never stopped doing it lol


[11-Feb-20 02:40 PM] emma;#1525
More boards means more things people can leak lol


[11-Feb-20 02:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but isnt the attendance board just hrs


[11-Feb-20 02:55 PM] bman#0435
a new board wasnt rly my idea but idrc how it would get implemented


[11-Feb-20 02:55 PM] bman#0435
i just see my suggestion more useful and less chaotic


[11-Feb-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie I don’t think so bc that would mean we’d have to log all attendance for managers


[11-Feb-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
Which is a lot lol


[11-Feb-20 03:18 PM] emma;#1525
honestly I think if we just get rid of the reports card then it’ll be a lot better, tracking reports is something we can easily do on the MB by looking at board activity


[11-Feb-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
is it just me or do security get reported for the smallest things related to the segways


[11-Feb-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
like they will do a single spin


[11-Feb-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
and they will be reported for segway abuse for spinning


[11-Feb-20 03:38 PM] ethan;#0003
or like a mobile player accidently has the cuffs out and they dont notice


[11-Feb-20 03:41 PM] ethan;#0003
And I feel like for staff reports


[11-Feb-20 03:41 PM] ethan;#0003
they never give them a reminder


[11-Feb-20 03:41 PM] ethan;#0003
like "oh you shouldnt do that"

**__Interviewing Procedure Reminder:__**


Salutations, MR Team!

It has come to our attention that many of you have disregarded the previous announcement made about this issue. Many of you put unnecessary rules/information in your introduction when interviewing. The host has most likely already announced the rules/information that you put in your guide. By doing this, you are taking up precious time in sessions. This causes sessions to take longer than they should. Once again, please refrain from going over additional rules or information before you begin the interview. 


**Example of an acceptable introduction:** 1.) Greetings, welcome to the Bloxton Hotels Interview Center. I am Bliss, your interviewer this evening. 2.) Do any of you have any questions or concerns before we begin the interview? 3.) Alright, we will now begin the interview. I wish you all the best of luck!


If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please do not be afraid to contact any member of the HR team. Thank you!


Signed,

__**Termination Of DianIyn**__


Greetings once again, MR team. 

The HR team would like to inform you that we have made the decision of releasing one of the members of the Bloxton MR Team. After taking some time investigating her incident, we have concluded that DianIyn, a Management, was suspected of account sharing. We do not tolerate account sharing under any circumstances since this is a security risk. It is also against the ROBLOX ToS. It was quite a shock when this was brought upon us and I am sure that it is appalling to you all as well. Of course, this information is not to be shared outside of the MR team or disclosed to unauthorized users. 


Thank you,

_blissuh_

Pretty good


[11-Feb-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd add on to the last sentence of taking about the consequence of it


[11-Feb-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
All in all tho


[11-Feb-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No faults


[11-Feb-20 05:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
the consequence of them sharing it to unauthorized users right


[11-Feb-20 05:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm


[11-Feb-20 05:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[11-Feb-20 05:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

okie


[11-Feb-20 05:43 PM] emma;#1525
@bman you need to say more that she was “suspected” of account sharing


[11-Feb-20 05:43 PM] emma;#1525
Bc she was just suspected we had proof


[11-Feb-20 05:43 PM] emma;#1525
We don’t fire people with just suspections lol


[11-Feb-20 05:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[11-Feb-20 05:44 PM] emma;#1525

[11-Feb-20 05:44 PM] emma;#1525

[11-Feb-20 05:45 PM] emma;#1525
She’s still a senior staff so she’ll either keep up good behavior and prob just get rehired or she’ll start trolling again


[11-Feb-20 05:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
true


[11-Feb-20 05:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[11-Feb-20 05:48 PM] emma;#1525
@¢. ღ send her those screenshots and say “excuse me?”


[11-Feb-20 05:48 PM] emma;#1525
Bc if she’s letting her sister on that’s a prooooblem


[11-Feb-20 05:48 PM] emma;#1525
But if her sister is forcing her to share then idk Bc that’s never happened before lol


[11-Feb-20 05:48 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
apparently she cant change her pass bc her "sister is older"


[11-Feb-20 05:48 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
that doesnt make since

not rly good having her account available to her sister--


[11-Feb-20 05:49 PM] emma;#1525
As long as Sarah has access to the email her account is linked to she can change her password


[11-Feb-20 05:49 PM] emma;#1525
As an older sister I don’t buy that lol


[11-Feb-20 05:49 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[11-Feb-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435
um @xM_inn are managers supposed to log their sessions when they join a server or when it ends. armani and jxlly logged it before naming even started e.e


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
this is honestly y i think its inconvenient


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
becuase they could just come to name


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
and leave


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
and call that a session for themselves


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
like they didnt even do anything before logging it


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
and therefore it wasnt a valid session yet


[11-Feb-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
i like the method i suggested


[11-Feb-20 08:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@bonnie591 when can we ask to promote a senior


[11-Feb-20 08:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@bman after


[11-Feb-20 08:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
If they log before they haven’t even done the session yet so it doesn’t count

[11-Feb-20 08:23 PM] bman#0435
they didnt attend a session that didnt end yet


[11-Feb-20 08:23 PM] bman#0435
lol


[11-Feb-20 08:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wut


[11-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435
they stated "attended" but it didnt even end


[11-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435
so


[11-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[11-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435
they either need to actually attend the session fully


[11-Feb-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435
or learn their verb tenses


[11-Feb-20 08:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
They can log if they leave halfway through but if they do they need to say they left halfway through


[11-Feb-20 08:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg beanman dms


[11-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
cookie dey still in the server doe


[11-Feb-20 08:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[11-Feb-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
and they did it before naming even started


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
therefore, they didnt "attended" a session


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Dey shouldn’t log that early


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
they just joined


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bruh


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya I think normally that would be a warning BUT


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
another reason y i dont like the session card


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Considering we started this thing today just tell them not to do that


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
and the for the reports, people r logging 3 reports reviewed 💀


[11-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Then after I week if we still have this thing start handing out warnings for it


[11-Feb-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
holly log a SINGLE staff report


[11-Feb-20 08:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut


[11-Feb-20 08:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y tho


[11-Feb-20 08:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
it doesnt rlly matter as long as its logged @bman


[11-Feb-20 08:48 PM] bman#0435
that doesnt rly make sense to me


[11-Feb-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
y isnt connor suspended


[11-Feb-20 09:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That would be my responsibility


[11-Feb-20 09:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't suspend him yet since I'm just mentally and physically tired


[11-Feb-20 09:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm a little bit better but


[11-Feb-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
o i was wondering since i saw him chatting in sl


[11-Feb-20 09:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah


[11-Feb-20 09:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I was just in a really bad mood and my body was not feeling it


[11-Feb-20 11:53 PM] a. ღ#4222
@bman I agree with ya, u can’t log before a session because a lot of my managers leave halfway thro lol


[12-Feb-20 02:11 AM] emma;#1525

There is an exploiter, who is making alts. But I found out he is a former management, who recently sent a ban appeal to Trey.


[12-Feb-20 09:28 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Jx_syToday at 11:26 PM
Yes.
He said I shouldn't tell no one, as he wants to get unbanned, but as my job I had to tell you.
Mackpacker | School.Today at 11:27 PM
do you have proof of him saying that he is actually noah?
Jx_syToday at 11:27 PM
I don't, but in one server, someone said are you noahvyy, he said maybe.
I currently added him as friends.

@xAfroTrey you’re gonna have to talk to her Bc she’s not answering me


[12-Feb-20 09:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll do it


[12-Feb-20 09:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I just need to figure out how to start it off


[12-Feb-20 09:42 AM] emma;#1525
honestly tho I doubt she’ll respond to you either


[12-Feb-20 09:42 AM] emma;#1525
she’s prob upset she lost her roles


[12-Feb-20 09:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wanna start off by saying


[12-Feb-20 09:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Hey, I know you lost your roles and all, but I would like to talk to you about something if you don't mind."


[12-Feb-20 09:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't have many ideas soo

[12-Feb-20 11:23 AM] Polk#1596
kenzi is basically saying


[12-Feb-20 11:23 AM] Polk#1596
she thinks 20 reports every week is too much


[12-Feb-20 11:23 AM] Polk#1596
because of timezones etc


[12-Feb-20 11:25 AM] Tattoblue#5828
She’s basically acknowledging the inactive people


[12-Feb-20 11:29 AM] ethan;#0003
@Polk she’s saying complete bullshit


[12-Feb-20 11:29 AM] ethan;#0003
She is online 24/7


[12-Feb-20 11:30 AM] ethan;#0003
She stays up intill 6 am her time


[12-Feb-20 11:31 AM] ethan;#0003
She’s just too lazy


[12-Feb-20 11:33 AM] emma;#1525
are we even really checking if they do 20 reports a week


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
idts


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
yea i kinda found it hard to believe


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
that she cant do 20 reports


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
every week


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
and shes saying like its unfair for the inactive people


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
but like if they are actually inactive


[12-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
they have an inactive notice


[12-Feb-20 11:35 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but some indeed are hogging stuff tho


[12-Feb-20 11:35 AM] Polk#1596
so they wont be doing anything


[12-Feb-20 11:35 AM] Polk#1596
i havent looked at it yet but im sure they do


[12-Feb-20 11:35 AM] Polk#1596
maybe a rule like "you can only do maximum 20 reports every 2 days" would fix it


[12-Feb-20 11:35 AM] Polk#1596
but idk


[12-Feb-20 11:38 AM] bman#0435
it hasnt even been a week


[12-Feb-20 11:38 AM] bman#0435
how can she assess her abilities after 24 hours


[12-Feb-20 11:39 AM] bman#0435
but, again, people hog reports like how anna and emily hogged applications


[12-Feb-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
so many calls for MRs happen on the group wall


[12-Feb-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
Sorry that’s just BS


[12-Feb-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
They can get to 20 easily


[12-Feb-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
It’s less than 3 a day


[12-Feb-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
lmao

@xM_inn since everyone is freaking out about requirements now can we add a caveat of “if you really tried to meet requirements but couldn’t for whatever reason that’s fine, you won’t be fired immediately for not making it one week”


[12-Feb-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
or how abt there isnt a requirement


[12-Feb-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
because claire and lyoo apparently r hogging the reports


[12-Feb-20 11:45 AM] emma;#1525
I’d be okay with “if you can’t meet one requirement you can supplement it with another as long as you are evening it out over a few weeks”


[12-Feb-20 11:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the new anna and emily i see


[12-Feb-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
they carelessly review reports rhat had already been reviewed


[12-Feb-20 11:45 AM] emma;#1525
so like they can do less reports one week and more sessions to make up for it


[12-Feb-20 11:45 AM] emma;#1525
But they have to do reports the next week


[12-Feb-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
like the managers would react to reporrs rhat alrwady were reviewee


[12-Feb-20 11:47 AM] emma;#1525
Lyoo is being annoying omg


[12-Feb-20 11:47 AM] emma;#1525
Wasn’t lyoo supposed to be suspended


[12-Feb-20 11:47 AM] emma;#1525
Or warned or something


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
What I miss


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hes always been annoying


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] emma;#1525
me: HRs aren’t scary


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] emma;#1525
Also me: if you don’t communicate issues to us you won’t be promoted


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] emma;#1525
Oops


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] emma;#1525
Maybe I’m scary


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] emma;#1525
But that’s okay


[12-Feb-20 11:48 AM] emma;#1525
Not an excuse


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
Are we talking about the new report logs


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lyoo and claire are hogging everyth


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or like managers are overlapping reports


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
by double ticking


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
Cause yeah I had concern it would be hard for managers to do reports


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
Like I think we should get rid of it


[12-Feb-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
People be thinking it’s a competition now


[12-Feb-20 11:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
they wont be promoted anyways lol


[12-Feb-20 11:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

If you want any of my sessions ever just take it lol


[12-Feb-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
I have to plan a lot ahead of time to get the times I want


[12-Feb-20 11:52 AM] Polk#1596
its not my fault that i cant host on a short notice everyday! @emma;


[12-Feb-20 11:53 AM] Polk#1596
i need to plan them a few days ahead so i know i have time


[12-Feb-20 11:53 AM] Polk#1596
cuz i dont wanna cancel


[12-Feb-20 12:05 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk ya thats fine lol every once in a while other HRs just have to beg to host


[12-Feb-20 12:05 PM] emma;#1525
bc some of us can't plan 3 days in advance


[12-Feb-20 12:37 PM] katie#0200
i wanna schedule sessions but idk if I’ll be free at a certain time a few days in advance lol


[12-Feb-20 12:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oop


[12-Feb-20 12:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh I plan the same day cause thats when I know I’m free but it’s always busy


[12-Feb-20 12:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’m never free during weekdays though unless it’s break


[12-Feb-20 12:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so that’s why I always try hosting during weekend


[12-Feb-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435

imma be honest, we dont rly need session logs if seniors note their names down. and if ur concern abt it is hrs and sessions then maybe we need to start attendance


[12-Feb-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
i dont see a point in them logging sessions when seniors technically do it for them too.

ODing


[12-Feb-20 04:01 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Idk if trey tagged for this or not but I just got a report of Lucas ODing kathy (manager) and apple (the one who faked her suicide). Kinda a dumb report but y'all might care about it more than I do. If you care about it, let me know, if not you can laugh at the screenshots of young kids telling each other they love each other then accusing them of cheating on each other.


[12-Feb-20 04:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

LMAO I JUST LOOKED UP HIS HISTORY IN ARCHIVED CARDS AND I FOUND THIS:


[12-Feb-20 06:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Minor admin abuse by giving a none Security staff member a segway as shown by the screenshot provided by LeviSmh which, it's unacceptable to see an MR abuse their admin commands, to be honest. Also, a few minutes ago when I joined him at the hotel real quick to tell him about his suspension. He immediately left after I joined, which could mean that he is up to something. I checked the logs & the chat logs which, it appears to show that he was kicking players randomly nonstop because there weren't enough "players" on the server apparently. In the chat logs, he was cooking up a possible recipe for a nice promotion out in the hunt which, again shows bad reputation to an MR at Hilton Hotels. ~z_Jack | Will be unsuspended in nine days.

[12-Feb-20 08:43 PM] bman#0435
i was thinking a warning for minor lack of grammar and minor disrespect


[12-Feb-20 08:43 PM] bman#0435
but im not rly sure


[12-Feb-20 08:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's a suspension and let me tell you why


[12-Feb-20 08:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Using his relative's death as an excuse for his behavior is no bueno


[12-Feb-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It also doesn't help that is grammar was completely absent at times @bman

i was planning to but decided to avoid it


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because i know she's gonna leak my DMs at some point


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
plus


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's gonna dig a deeper hole than she already is


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know she's 13 but


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525

[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:cringe:


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525

uh oh


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525
and if she’s lucky we’ll just ignore her


[13-Feb-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435

blacklist and ban from the discord?


[13-Feb-20 03:36 PM] bman#0435
thats what the other officer did


[13-Feb-20 03:36 PM] Polk#1596

[13-Feb-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey told Alex she should ban ava from her disc


[13-Feb-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What do you think about a BH ban and blacklist


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] bman#0435
can we even blacklist


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
Thought she already had one


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] bman#0435
it wasnt in the bh serer]


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wanted to hold it off


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She still posted pornography for many to see


[13-Feb-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I'm pretty sure the users there are from the Bloxton community


[13-Feb-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
A more valid reason for a blacklist (since that kinda isn’t lol) would be her allowing doxxing


[13-Feb-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
Which is very dangerous


[13-Feb-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
And cyber bullying


[13-Feb-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
Which is illegal


[13-Feb-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For sure


[13-Feb-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She made fun of Saab's appearance


[13-Feb-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
Harriet apparently sent in an appeal to sizzle


[13-Feb-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's not going to go through


[13-Feb-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
It could if she bats her eyelashes enough


[13-Feb-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you might wanna look into that


[13-Feb-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Highly doubt it


[13-Feb-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that's just me


[13-Feb-20 03:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm thinking of the possibility of putting her on no appeals w/ a ban on Discord


[13-Feb-20 03:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
(Not Harriet)


[13-Feb-20 03:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ava is like this 12 year old horny kid who knows way too much for her age..


[13-Feb-20 03:43 PM] bman#0435

There's no way to communicate with her since she closed DMs


[13-Feb-20 03:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm going to let her burn her own bridges and see what will go down

Have her wait 30 days at the moment.

It was relatively inexcusable having to see her chat in that manner.


[13-Feb-20 05:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@High Rank Anna has continued to pass highly suspicious accounts while failing to tell us that they were suspicious. We've reminded her twice now, one time in DMs and one announcement to Seniors. Seeing as this has been recurring since the start of December, she hasn't learned her lesson yet or how she should properly note names down as a head. If you believe there should be a consequence, then react with the following stuff.
❌ = No consequence, verbal reminder.
:check: = Written warning.
☑️ = Suspension (3 days minimum)

for glitchers we dont warn them before we ban right


[13-Feb-20 10:49 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
like if they glitch excessively they get banned


[13-Feb-20 10:49 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i dont think warning them would be necessary since they know what theyre doing and it would take a lot of time just to warn


[13-Feb-20 10:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we usually warn them


[13-Feb-20 10:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but i think that regulation could use a change


[13-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
me too


[13-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and apparently a lot of people are confused about it


[13-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i mean, when people glitch they obviously know what theyre doing


[13-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i think if they are shown glitching 3+ times in a video/gif they should be banned for excessive glitching


[13-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
no warnings are really necessary

Dear Annamazing29,

I am here to inform you that you have received an official written warning as of 2/14/20 due to failing to comply and meet Senior standards when noting down passers. While you have been verbally reminded before, alongside an announcement being made towards the whole Senior team, the HR team has seen consistency of the action, which is noting down suspicious users without labeling them as suspicious. The HR team requests that you provide this tag next to a passers' username if suspicious so we can take precautions when ranking. As you are well aware, a Senior's job is more than to just note down names; You too should also seek precaution for suspicious users in your servers. Please take this warning into consideration for future sessions and noting down passers, as the HR team will appreciate the tag in the future. Thank you for understanding and have a great day.

[14-Feb-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
You can make a ticket to request for the talkative role, but you will not be supplied the Former MR role at this time. You were warned because of that "story" you told within the VC, and therefore led you to a 3rd overall warning in the server. You should know that 3 warnings is equal to a kick, considering you are a former Manager.

@High Rank Wanna make a gamenight/event announcements channel in the main Discord server? I've noticed that we tend to clog the main announcements channel up with game nights lately, so it'd be pretty cool to have another channel for them instead. Name of channel still to be decided.

If you can come please tell me ASAP as if you cannot I will re-pick. They are all attending, if you could tell me if you are aswell.

" While you have been verbally reminded before, alongside an announcement being made towards the whole Senior team, the HR team has seen consistency of the action, which is noting down suspicious users without labeling them as suspicious."


[14-Feb-20 10:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so


[14-Feb-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
change it to this (this will take some time for me to write)


[14-Feb-20 10:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
While you have been verbally warned before, along w/ an announcement posted on the #senior-announcements channel, the HR Team has noticed that you have consistently failed on noting down many users as suspicious on the passers list.


[14-Feb-20 10:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also change this this sentence too:


[14-Feb-20 10:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"The HR team requests that you provide this tag next to a passers' username if suspicious so we can take precautions when ranking."


[14-Feb-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435
Dear Annamazing29,

I am here to inform you that you have received an official written warning as of 2/14/20 due to failing to comply and meet Senior standards when noting down passers. While you have been verbally warned before, along w/ an announcement posted on the #senior-announcements channel, the HR Team has noticed that you have consistently failed on noting down many users as suspicious on the passers list. The HR team requests that you provide this tag next to a passers' username if suspicious so we can take precautions when ranking. As you are well aware, a Senior's job is more than to just note down names; You too should also seek precaution for suspicious users in your servers. Please take this warning into consideration for future sessions and noting down passers, as the HR team will appreciate the tag in the future. Thank you for understanding and have a great day.

[14-Feb-20 10:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
(again, im going to write this for a bit so hold on)


[14-Feb-20 10:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The HR Team would like for you, in the future, to provide a tag next to the passer's username labeled as suspicious. That way, we are able to know what users we may be able to skip during the ranking process.


[14-Feb-20 10:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so for this sentence


[14-Feb-20 10:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"As you are well aware, a Senior's job is more than to just note down names; You too should also seek precaution for suspicious users in your servers."


[14-Feb-20 10:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
change it into this


[14-Feb-20 10:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
As you are well aware, a Senior's job is more than just writing down names for passing on the Senior Management Board. You should be able to do the necessary steps that we have shared on the announcement on 1/23/20.


[14-Feb-20 10:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's it tho

do we have to use grammar after trainees have been ranked in a themed session @xM_inn


[15-Feb-20 12:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
once everyone has finished training, you don't have to use grammar


[15-Feb-20 12:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
but you're still expected to remain somewhat mature


[15-Feb-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
alright cool


[15-Feb-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was a bit skeptical since there was a sequence where didn't use grammar


[15-Feb-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
all i remember from the session is us pretty much having a good time

apparently there was a rumor that's she's apparently a CB but


[15-Feb-20 12:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) there's no proof yet


[15-Feb-20 12:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
B) even if we did, we'd still fire her


[15-Feb-20 12:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
disappointed but still taking action nonetheless

i really think we should give ava no appeals


[15-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's not learning anything and she's just making it worse on herself


[15-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xM_inn#2821

[15-Feb-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435
omg where did u get that idea from??!?!?!!


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
i wouldve never concluded that!!! :000


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wanted to be lenient since she's 13 yrs old but


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
pretty sure shes 7 now


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's just adding more fuel to the fire


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
shes thirsty for attention, and shes obviously loving the attention by being the owner of a toxic former mr server!


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
but ok :uwuclown:


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
she was going to add swan and sadder


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
how do you feel about no appeals permitted? @xM_inn


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
but soon that'll all end, and she'll come back to us, but unfortunately she won't be welcome anymore


[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435

[15-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xM_inn#2821

[15-Feb-20 11:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know it


[15-Feb-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
if she wants to go choose swan over us then that says a lot, considering what swan did


[15-Feb-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
BUT ITS OK! PPL BE FAKE ALL THE TIME! TRUE COLOURS ONLY SHOW OVER TIME!


[15-Feb-20 11:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think swan is going to do anything tbh


[15-Feb-20 11:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
like she's an MR at SB and she knows what's going to happen


[15-Feb-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435

[15-Feb-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435

[15-Feb-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
swan doesnt troll anymore and leaves us alone and wants nothing to do with us

[15-Feb-20 03:00 PM] bman#0435
Dear Annamazing29,

You are receiving a written warning due to consistently passing users at the TC and IC with suspicious accounts. As per the announcement to seniors and previous verbal warnings given to you, we require all hosts to take the time to info each passer and note down next to their name if they have a low age or any other factors that may seem suspicious. If you do not start following these rules, further consequences may have to take place as you’ve been informed of this numerous times already.

Let me know if you have any questions about how this process is supposed to work so I can ensure you have the information necessary for this.

[15-Feb-20 03:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He should honestly receive a long suspension or firing.


[15-Feb-20 03:00 PM] a. ღ#4222

[15-Feb-20 03:01 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[15-Feb-20 03:01 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
id be fine with a firing or suspension


[15-Feb-20 03:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but, he deserves a suspension again. At worst, a firing.


[15-Feb-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435
a firing would be tooo harsh dont u think


[15-Feb-20 03:02 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

I'm not afraid to suspend him again, but if Story wants to do it, I'm down.

I understand where you are coming from by saying we can't assume people are circumventing based off of account ages, but we have noticed you passed accounts that were created the day of or within a 5 day range of the session. There are many different ways you can prove if an account is valid or not, and if you need help judging and evaluating it's validity then you should request for an HR to help you, as we will be available. I, personally, would suggest checking accounts under the age of 30 as those tend to be the most suspicious and common accounts for a CB to use. Overall, you should still let us know who is and isn't suspicious to you, because your eyes will help us. Thank you for understanding, and if you have anything else to ask/say, don't hesitate to contact me.

@High Rank Hi, guysss. So, I was hoping that we could all discuss what Trip mentioned in this DM from her - I believe that we should come to a conclusion on what the consequences of glitching/different types of glitching are and what's worth a ban to make it clearer for managers reviewing reports, perhaps more enforcement on the max amount of managers rule thing and some other stuff, lmk what you think

[16-Feb-20 07:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i dont think we should have to warn someone when they glitch


[16-Feb-20 07:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
we know that they arent going to stop glitching if they know how to glitch


[16-Feb-20 07:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so id say if they glitch 3+ times they deserve to be banned


[16-Feb-20 07:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
without warnings needed


[16-Feb-20 07:46 PM] katie#0200
i agree, i ban if they glitch 3+ times anyway


[16-Feb-20 07:46 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 08:46 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
@High Rank How do we feel about permanently banning glitchers every time they glitch 3+ times? Since we know their intentions if they know how to glitch, they obviously don't really need warnings.

**__GLITCHERS__**

Greetings, everyone!

It has come to our attention that many are confused on what to do with glitchers. To clarify, if someone glitches 3+ times they are to be auto-cuffed and permanently banned. No warnings are necessary. If you encounter a glitcher, make sure to have a gif or a recording of them glitching 3+ times. Hopefully this cleared up any confusion that any of you may have had. If you have any questions or concerns regarding my announcement, do not be afraid to contact any member of the HR team with your concern/question! Thank you.

Signed,

[16-Feb-20 10:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
No suspension since he isn’t a huge threat to the integrity. They only have access to Roblox


[16-Feb-20 10:04 PM] a. ღ#4222
like what more do uthink


[16-Feb-20 10:04 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think we need to question omer


[16-Feb-20 10:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes that’s fine


[16-Feb-20 10:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
so like


[16-Feb-20 10:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
question without suspension then?


[16-Feb-20 10:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
ig that makes sense but if he is actually a cb then


[16-Feb-20 10:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
uh

[16-Feb-20 10:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think suspending him wouldnt be a bad idea cause if he actually is a cb he can get proof and use it against us if we started questioning him

Omer is like 12 year old


[16-Feb-20 10:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Or 13


[16-Feb-20 10:46 PM] ethan;#0003
I just assume that because he has a bedtime of 10 pm on a weekend

Just like they did with Bearvish


[16-Feb-20 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
They tricked us making us think that he was a CB


[16-Feb-20 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
So they can try an ruin his life


[16-Feb-20 10:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I feel like this is a repeat of that


[16-Feb-20 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
And Omer has been here way way before CBs


[16-Feb-20 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
He’s been here since V5


[16-Feb-20 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
So everything that girl is saying is 🧢


[16-Feb-20 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Feb-20 10:54 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Feb-20 11:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
im not saying its 100% legit


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
omer never rly seemed the type to be a cb or account sharing


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ethan;#0003
How to solve it: ask Omer “are you a cb” 😎


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think a lot of it is fake \


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i wanna see if that server theyre talking about is legit


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
thats like asking interviewees if they are a cb


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
apparently he "posts updates"


[16-Feb-20 11:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
on his acc


[16-Feb-20 11:13 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you should


[16-Feb-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[16-Feb-20 11:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if kitten doesnt get anymore evidence i say we should unsuspend him


[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ye


[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if there even is one


[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
idk why they chose omer tho


[16-Feb-20 11:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if they did that


[16-Feb-20 11:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
could be spite over something


[16-Feb-20 11:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[16-Feb-20 11:27 PM] ethan;#0003

@¢. ღ tell him he was suspended due to being placed under investigation, its standard procedure to prevent any malicious actions during the investigation


[16-Feb-20 11:43 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he wants to see the evidence

only show evidence which is most important tho, no point showing the entire evidence with the false information

Omg you noobs


[17-Feb-20 12:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I told you not to suspend until you were absolutely sure he did it…


[17-Feb-20 12:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
We need to stop this circumstantial BS until we know for sure they are involved, not if they are suspected of it


[17-Feb-20 12:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
grrrrrr


[17-Feb-20 01:07 AM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming agreed


[17-Feb-20 04:20 AM] stacey#1000
I agree with Emma and Ramm. The only valid evidence I actually saw Omer might be a cb is a photo of him being on his account on roblox, which anyone could EASILY photoshop. I think legit, if they are like trying to compromise the group or whatever, that this is how they do it. They make false accusations to get us to falsely suspend our MRs, causing them to feel bad about themselves and that they are treated unfairly, then they resign over it and possibly their friends follow them. Remember that, This is exactly how they trying to compromise the group.

I didn’t do it yet


[17-Feb-20 08:52 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I’ll ping u when I do it <:


[17-Feb-20 08:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Also what happened to Omer


[17-Feb-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000
He got suspended for suspicion of being a cb then got unsuspended because there wasn’t really much evidence and the people saying it probably were lying and apparently they claim cbs get paid. I doubt that and if it’s true they really have no life.


[17-Feb-20 08:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I would be upset too


[17-Feb-20 08:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
That happened to me when I first became an MR and it scared the absolute shit out of me


[17-Feb-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah when I got manager people tried getting me falsely fired. It’s not fun I feel bad for Omer


[17-Feb-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
But yeah I don’t trust that girl that is claiming he is a cb


[17-Feb-20 08:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Who


[17-Feb-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
Or like helping cbs or some shit


[17-Feb-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
The girl that reported it


[17-Feb-20 08:57 AM] stacey#1000
I forget her name


[17-Feb-20 08:57 AM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[17-Feb-20 08:57 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Is it in the pictures


[17-Feb-20 08:57 AM] stacey#1000
The only evidence that was there was like showing being on omers account but like anyone can use inspect element to say they are on someone’s account


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
And if you scroll up yeah


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Is that even evidence though


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
lol


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
No


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
That’s why I don’t trust it


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
He could have taken a video or a picture of it and sent it somewhere


[17-Feb-20 08:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
They pick it up and use it


[17-Feb-20 08:59 AM] stacey#1000
They trying to like compromise the group and this is how they do it. They get us to falsely suspend MRs to make them feel bad and make them want to quit


[17-Feb-20 08:59 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[17-Feb-20 02:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
that was harriet assuming it was from kelly, not sb lmao


[17-Feb-20 02:42 PM] katie#0200
yeah but they still accepted it even tho harriet was going on about kelly in her appeal


[17-Feb-20 02:42 PM] bman#0435
ok but her whole letter was blaming it kn kelly when the sb hrs clearly knew it was us

[17-Feb-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
or whatever her name is


[17-Feb-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
idk if magnolia ever saw the document i sent to death1y


[17-Feb-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn is death1y a sketchy person bc why does magnolia seem like she's never seen this before lol


[17-Feb-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
no


[17-Feb-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
deathy is the original compliance department head


[17-Feb-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
but then he resigned


[17-Feb-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
so shes the new department head


[17-Feb-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Feb-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
well shes not **brand new**


[17-Feb-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821

[17-Feb-20 03:02 PM] xM_inn#2821

[17-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Polk#1596
oof


[17-Feb-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
why would they accept one of the biggest trollers of all time


[17-Feb-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435
@Polk she blamed it all on kelly and claimed half of it was fake


[17-Feb-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
i would have declined it right away if i saw her blame it on someone else while we knew they reporter


[17-Feb-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
lol


[17-Feb-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
because to blame it on others is just a big no


[17-Feb-20 03:17 PM] Polk#1596
:/


[17-Feb-20 03:17 PM] Polk#1596
thats so dumb


[17-Feb-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
@bman i told magnolia that i want to be informed about what they decide and im more than happy to point out what is false about harriett's whole document


[17-Feb-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
so we'll see


[17-Feb-20 03:18 PM] emma;#1525
i will raise hell tho so minn might have to prepare to not let me talk to allies for a while lol


[17-Feb-20 03:18 PM] Polk#1596

[17-Feb-20 03:47 PM] bman#0435
not kick messages


[17-Feb-20 03:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
If the person kicked had blocked the MR, then the kick reason isn't shown as it's a form of communication


[17-Feb-20 03:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did I miss something


[17-Feb-20 03:47 PM] bman#0435

[17-Feb-20 05:11 PM] bman#0435
harriet appealed, blamed it all on kelly and said it was fake, and they believed her


[17-Feb-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you need to have a big talk with them bc they're losing the support of most of us as an ally lol


[17-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[17-Feb-20 05:15 PM] bman#0435

[17-Feb-20 05:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

@emma; dm me screenshots of ur entire DMs with her


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
The entire compliance department was like we received a complaint at the complaint center that you were rude to an ally by calling him a stalker


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
compliance and human resources isnt a thing anymore


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
We will be creating a group chat soon to discuss about it with both of you


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
4 days later


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
they merged together; staff management


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[17-Feb-20 05:17 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Strxw has called off the complaint


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
No need for a group chat anymore


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Why


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] bman#0435
if they arent doing anything about an ally complaining abt their mr then they need to improve their staff management team


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Compliance and human resource is good


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] bman#0435
we have MORE than enough evidence


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I miss Claraplays in human resource


[17-Feb-20 05:18 PM] xM_inn#2821

@High Rank I've reviewed all alliance applications and decided on who has passed the application stage. I've uploaded the three groups that I've accepted to the alliance board. Their group information and their alliance applications can be found in the description of their respective cards. Please begin research & discussion regarding the groups for the next week, after that week, you may begin voting on whether you want the group or don't want the group as an alliance. Thanks!

Reading all the applications, the one that stands out the most is TRGH. They put a lot of effort into the application and from when I remember going to that game, I enjoyed it. I just have to visit it again since it’s been awhile.


[18-Feb-20 06:38 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[18-Feb-20 07:54 AM] katie#0200
I remember working at TRGH in 2017 and I quit in early 2018


[18-Feb-20 07:55 AM] katie#0200
The group that they mention having 200k was a mess imo because when I was an MR there most of the HRs and MRs including myself decided to start up a new hospital group ourselves due to a massive AA attack by one of the HRs, not sure if they still work there


[18-Feb-20 07:57 AM] katie#0200
I’m sure they’ve improved tho and I’ll check their new group out later

I think it's too soon, but this was such a bad decision.


[18-Feb-20 11:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think they've believed what came out her mouth and they went along with it.


[18-Feb-20 11:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because Harriet is **very** manipulative, so I'm like 10% not really shocked.

id like to know who she discussed it with

it doesnt take half a day to make a decision smh


[18-Feb-20 11:25 AM] bman#0435
they shouldve rly considered everything we, an strong alliance, over a manipulative, lying, annoying, inconsiderate person


[18-Feb-20 11:25 AM] bman#0435
harriet only cares about herself and thats facts


[18-Feb-20 11:25 AM] bman#0435
she made it seem like we were all against her

Im disappointed in SizzleBurger. I don’t plan on ever doing an alliance visit there again, as long as Harriet is there. She hates my guts anyway for assuming stuff about me.


[18-Feb-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
I think highly of SizzleBurger, and this is really low


[18-Feb-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
After I spoke to her, I honestly thought she was going to terminate.. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/469968624711368704/679377507622977557/unknown.png

I have no respect for SizzleBurger right now.


[18-Feb-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
Or for whenever made this decision.


[18-Feb-20 11:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
Also, based on what she said in Emma's DMs "Our choice will continue to be unchanged unless there is a situation involving her which directly affects SizzleBurger's operations" so basically they'll never take action against someone for violating rules at an alliance cause it doesn't directly effect sizzleburger, how nice


[18-Feb-20 11:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yet we've literally fired/suspended MRs who've violated rules at alliances, PARTICULARLY SIZZLEBURGER??


[18-Feb-20 11:31 AM] bman#0435
technically it does affect sizzleburger operations


[18-Feb-20 11:31 AM] bman#0435

[18-Feb-20 11:31 AM] bman#0435
sb


[18-Feb-20 11:32 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
This is a bad decision, plain and simple.


[18-Feb-20 11:32 AM] bman#0435
when harriet is a highe rank then them, they would wanna leave


[18-Feb-20 11:32 AM] bman#0435
so


[18-Feb-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
It literally puts SizzleBurgers alliance at risk with Bloxton.


[18-Feb-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
Like legit I ain’t going there anymore n


[18-Feb-20 11:32 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not exactly, but this doesn't look good on SB.


[18-Feb-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
For awhile at least.


[18-Feb-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
Like if they keep this up I vote bye bye SizzleBurger from allies.


[18-Feb-20 11:34 AM] bman#0435
theyre basically throwing their group down the trash at this pojnt


[18-Feb-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
Yep.

honestly they need to do reforms to their ranks. if they dont havw the ability to listen to a full on alliance with more than enough proof and such, but continue to listen to the lies of someone else, they need to change it up

[18-Feb-20 04:26 PM] Polk#1596
bruh, this idiot called starry wore the inmate outfit and walked out of prison to trick me into thinking she was a prisoner, so i cuffed her and placed her back into a cell because there was someone in the prison and i just assumed it was them because she came literally walking out of the prison... i didnt think much of it until my acting sergeant dmed me about cuffing and placing an impersonator into a cell and the lieutenant even made an announcement about it and called me out for it in the DOC discord server :/ idk if this girl managed to ruin my reputation or what but it seriously annoys me how she just did that to ruin things for me @xM_inn

i stopped around ep 8


[18-Feb-20 04:53 PM] Tattoblue#5828
and the episodes are only like 9 min each lol


[18-Feb-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
Did no one tell the new seniors the asking time to host in advance is 30 mins


[18-Feb-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I just had to tell both of them which is fine but I thought they would’ve been told when promoted lol


[18-Feb-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
It’s all good tho


[18-Feb-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
They know now


[18-Feb-20 05:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Whats wrong with sb


[18-Feb-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
They didn’t listen to what we had to say about Harriet and they are still letting her be an MR there after Emma, Trey, and Minn addressed their concerns over it after what she did at an alliance. They made a bad decision and yeah I don’t respect SB now. They basically are saying they don’t care we are allies and that Harriet has to do something there directly to get fired.


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Time to leave sb


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Smh


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
So glad I don’t work at SB


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I have to show face to her now?


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
No ty


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
I ain’t ever doing alliance visit there again


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I have to beg her to kick trollers?


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
No ty


[18-Feb-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
They becoming the group that lets Cbs be MRs


[18-Feb-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
And yeah if they keep this up I vote bye bye SB as an ally


[18-Feb-20 05:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think their staff management team is a little bonkers


[18-Feb-20 05:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Last time it was good having HR and compliance as different departments


[18-Feb-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Now the team is so huge


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
That new girl that made this decision is bad


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Compliance was like 3 ppl


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Or whoever made this decision


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So it was easy to discuss


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah so I guess they love Harriet


[18-Feb-20 05:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Love but nope


[18-Feb-20 05:24 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Any chance to unally sure ty


[18-Feb-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I want to unally and so does Emma


[18-Feb-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
They made a real bad move


[18-Feb-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
They clearly don’t care about their allies


[18-Feb-20 05:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Whats the point if we care abt their staff actions and ban their bad staff who work at bloxton but they dont care


[18-Feb-20 05:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Dont understand


[18-Feb-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
yeah exactly

@High Rank Dr_Niaa sent out an appeal for us to review. I personally think it's adequate and meets the requirements, but I'll leave it to you guys on your reactions on whether or not she can be appealed at this time. Appeal will be listed here:

[18-Feb-20 07:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oooo


[18-Feb-20 07:20 PM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 do u and the other bods decide if we do safechat test or is it baby and bear? our admin commands got updated so we can see if a player has safechat or not with it


[18-Feb-20 07:20 PM] bman#0435
like decide how sessions are run

[18-Feb-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
also cam had a good idea


[18-Feb-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
what if seniors put account ages next to passers and let us decide if we rank them or not


[18-Feb-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
That’s a lot of extra work


[18-Feb-20 07:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Another great update from Basic admin


[18-Feb-20 07:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
As long as we do a correct safechat test for receptionists, Baby and bear won't mind how we do it


[18-Feb-20 07:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
So if you wish to do it that way then sure


[18-Feb-20 07:22 PM] bonnie591#0591

[18-Feb-20 07:31 PM] katie#0200
Idk if it’s the people but I see the pings and it tags the whole support team role so


[18-Feb-20 07:31 PM] katie#0200
I think it’s happening every time a ticket is created


[18-Feb-20 07:32 PM] katie#0200
I’m pretty sure it’s the ticket not


[18-Feb-20 07:32 PM] katie#0200
Bot*

[18-Feb-20 07:33 PM] ethan;#0003

hm that could be fun


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] ethan;#0003
And there can be custom rank levels


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank I suggest blocking the ticket bot


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
i honestly think lrs will think they need to be a high level to get promoted


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
lol


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] katie#0200
we would need a diff prefix for it tho so when people warn they don’t get warned by two bots


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Why


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 why


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] katie#0200
It’s pinging the whole support team role when a new ticket gets created @ethan;


[18-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
So it doesnt ping


[18-Feb-20 07:35 PM] ethan;#0003
O


[18-Feb-20 07:35 PM] ethan;#0003
I didn’t get pinged


[18-Feb-20 07:35 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 can someone add the bot?


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] katie#0200
I’ll try and get a screenshot next time it pings


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] ethan;#0003
@katie we can make the prefix like $


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Except


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591

[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] katie#0200

[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bman#0435
idk im like


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bman#0435
weighing out pros and con


[18-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bman#0435
s


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] katie#0200
I don’t see an issue with it rlly


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] ethan;#0003
Something that is not ! ? Or -


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
because pro would increase activity


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] katie#0200
Unless more cons are pointed out


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
con it would spam up the chat with CONGRATS ETHAN ON LEVELING UP


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] katie#0200
Oh true


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] katie#0200
lol


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
then ppl will try to type


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
as much lines


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
as possible


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
like that


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] ethan;#0003
You can set it so it doesn’t remove it


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and try


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
and people will say !rank more frequent


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and ppl will think


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
but we can be more strict on bot-commands


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] ethan;#0003
@PackItUpMack you only get points for a rank up ever 3 or so minutes


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
more level = promo!


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
ya thats what i said


[18-Feb-20 07:37 PM] ethan;#0003
So spamming does nothing


[18-Feb-20 07:38 PM] ethan;#0003
In an announcement we would Say this bot is for fun and does not increase promotion chances


[18-Feb-20 07:38 PM] katie#0200
U can only get a certain amount of points per minute


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] ethan;#0003
No that’s not how it works


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] katie#0200
Yeah so it can’t be ? ! or ;


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] ethan;#0003
It can be ;


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] katie#0200
We already have a ; one


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and have to see whether u wanna use in staff lounge too


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] ethan;#0003
It can’t be ! ? Or -


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont think


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we need a mee6 bot


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] katie#0200
The music bot uses ;


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Oh


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause MRs might flex their level


[18-Feb-20 07:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Then make it $


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
in bot commands


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] ethan;#0003
That doesn’t really matter


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
do we need to say y if we vote no


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
then some lrs will search their chat history for whatever reason


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
then be like hoho is there some place ure talking more


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but im no tho


[18-Feb-20 07:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont think mee6 help much


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think that we dont need mee6 bc then ppl r gonna race for a promo and brag and stuff


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and then what mack just said


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and i think its just un needed and we dont need it


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] ethan;#0003
You can set it so it ignores staff lounge


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] ethan;#0003
And only detects general


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya btu ppl will think


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
more chatting = more promo


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
even tho u put for fun


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] ethan;#0003
We announce it and tell them


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
thats what always happens


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[18-Feb-20 07:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but ethan


[18-Feb-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no matter what u say about it


[18-Feb-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its gonna end up that way


[18-Feb-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc theres loads of ppl i bet that dont even read the announcements


[18-Feb-20 07:42 PM] katie#0200
yeah but that’s on them then if they don’t understand tho


[18-Feb-20 07:42 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah


[18-Feb-20 07:42 PM] ethan;#0003
That’s not our problem if we can’t get the message through Their heads


[18-Feb-20 07:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but i still dont think that we need it


[18-Feb-20 07:43 PM] ethan;#0003
Or we can ask seniors


[18-Feb-20 07:43 PM] ethan;#0003
Their opinions


[18-Feb-20 07:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
do we let NamiraMoonlight97 have former role


[18-Feb-20 07:44 PM] bman#0435

[18-Feb-20 07:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

@High Rank 
How do you guys feel about Seniors adding account ages to the passer cards now? Leave your opinions as well as a reaction with the vote. It is beneficial to both sides.
:check: - Yes
👀 - Optional to host
:no: - No.

Also, how do you feel about changing the safechat test to making it where managers info the players? This can also be optional. Leave your opinions as well as a reaction with the vote. I tested it out and it wasn't too bad at all, and Bonnie isn't against the idea.

:checkmark: - Yes.
:checkmark: - Optional for host.
⛔ - No.

[18-Feb-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What about a PM telling the Managers to info?


[18-Feb-20 08:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah but ive seen it not work before ethan


[18-Feb-20 08:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
so i dont do that


[18-Feb-20 08:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's pretty simple and provides the info.


[18-Feb-20 08:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

We need to stop pulling this “optional to host” bs


[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] bman#0435

[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] emma;#1525
Bc this is dumb


[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] bman#0435
its their decision


[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] emma;#1525

And I like it to a certain degree


[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] emma;#1525
But we need to standardize some things


[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] ethan;#0003
THIS IS DISGUSTING


[18-Feb-20 08:31 PM] ethan;#0003

[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] bman#0435
@emma; i dont get what u mean. because if u dont like giving seniors options for how they log stuff then their passer cards would all be the same. some have attendance on the top, some list the number ranks, others do word ranks, some do both.


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] bman#0435
each senior has a different way to host their sessions and to log stuff


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
thanks ethan for blessing me with that


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] bman#0435
same as how u and i have different ways of hosting


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
Yes


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
I blessed u

[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think account ages are a bit unnecessary considering that they can list them as suspicious.


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
:leg_blink:


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
**H E Y** @ethan;


[18-Feb-20 08:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
If the account age is low just kick them


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
I want to explain what I’m hearing


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
The account age thing isnt necessary


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
But I don’t think I should


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Therefore, I'm just going to put "No".


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
it just once again


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bman#0435
ya but trey


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
I can’t put into word what my ears are hearing in this bathroom


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
puts pressure on the senios


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
seniors


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bman#0435
the whole point of the ages is that seniors dont know what age is suspicious or not


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bman#0435
since we all have different perspectives on low account ages and suspicions


[18-Feb-20 08:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
lets make a suspicious age boundary then


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
like ethan could say 10 and below is suspicious while i could say 30


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok how about


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
seniors put the ages for the players with an account age of less than 60 days


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
how abt 45


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
since 60 is 2 months


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah sure


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
thats long enough


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think above 15 is fine


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
15-


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
stort-


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] a. ღ#4222
Yup


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think above 0 is fine.


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
as long as it is above 1k im fine


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
😌


[18-Feb-20 08:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
If someone comes to my interview on their first day then they are crazy


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think 30 is perfectly balanced.


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] a. ღ#4222
20


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
the funniest is when they made their account day of and use grammar before the interviews begin


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
💀


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's technically a month, and there's not too much issue w/ it.


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait a minute.


[18-Feb-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's one issue w/ it.


[18-Feb-20 08:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bonnie, you know how you pointed out that they can just kick them?


[18-Feb-20 08:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That could potentially go against the ToS, but that's just me.


[18-Feb-20 08:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think if it's under 30, we could do the questioning process like we do now.


[18-Feb-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
well


[18-Feb-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
technically


[18-Feb-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
the tos states that the game itself cant restrict users


[18-Feb-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
and not that players cant


[18-Feb-20 08:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not sure to what degree, but I'll look at it.


[18-Feb-20 08:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
are there still


[18-Feb-20 08:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
A lot of cbs


[18-Feb-20 08:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
Getting jobs


[18-Feb-20 08:40 PM] bman#0435
yes


[18-Feb-20 08:40 PM] bman#0435
every day


[18-Feb-20 08:40 PM] bman#0435
they have no lives


[18-Feb-20 08:40 PM] bman#0435
so


[18-Feb-20 08:40 PM] bman#0435
what do u expect


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're going to run their course. More than likely, I think it's going to happen during maybe spring time.


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] ethan;#0003
@bman the other day you said 35-40 is suspicious


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
did min get rid of reports for managers


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they have to do 20 thing


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But then again, it's pretty much an educational guess.


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Report logs?


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, they were removed since it didn't work out.


[18-Feb-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its still in this thing


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Now it's just session and hotel logs listed.

?


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't see why not.


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] ethan;#0003
No


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] ethan;#0003
They should still be doing it


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] ethan;#0003
Just not logging it


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; ya


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why not? There's no use for it.


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
35-40 is under 45


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
so


[18-Feb-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
ya


[18-Feb-20 08:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think it makes sense given that:


[18-Feb-20 08:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) It was voted out and archived.


[18-Feb-20 08:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
B) There's just not much use to it, and I think it's kind of extra.


[18-Feb-20 08:47 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey it doesn’t hurt to@keep it


[18-Feb-20 08:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But where are they going to provide it? Plus, it's pretty much gone at the moment.


[18-Feb-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
its incorrect info tho


[18-Feb-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
wait is that managers or seniors @Cooqkie


[18-Feb-20 08:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@bman I meant HRs should have the same procedures too lol


[18-Feb-20 09:44 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t get why we let everyone do completely different things


[18-Feb-20 09:45 PM] emma;#1525
Little things like how they list passers (number vs word) doesn’t matter at all, but the inclusion of ages should either be done all the time or never


[18-Feb-20 09:45 PM] emma;#1525
This is why managers and heads always mess up and y’all like to blame it all on them not paying attention


[18-Feb-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435

@Polk If anyone does that again, check their name to see if they're an inmate, if they're not arrest for impersonation and trespassing.


[19-Feb-20 04:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank so discord did a super cool new update and basically theres an option which allows only administrators and/or those with permission to tag roles. basically, this means we can tag server roles in the main discord without LRs/trollers abusing it in general. :weewoo: :pingblob:


[19-Feb-20 04:34 AM] katie#0200
oo


[19-Feb-20 04:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank deal with another ping, but on the alliance requests, ive added a checklist called visit reports. you're all expected to have visited and written a report regarding your visit within the next week. you comment your report on the respective card, and ill check off your name once ive read the report. please please please write the reports or else ill be upset!! thanks.

bruH


[19-Feb-20 06:24 AM] Polk#1596
yeah but being a CO is pretty chill (not for me since i get abused by the MRs and im pretty sure other COs hate being on shift with me since bloxton people keep coming to us) so its easier to do a long shift for me because in FSP u do way more all the time


[19-Feb-20 06:25 AM] Polk#1596
i was pretty proud tho, after my sessions i went back and did even more LOO

[19-Feb-20 10:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[19-Feb-20 10:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[19-Feb-20 10:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
wont die from not doing much reports


[19-Feb-20 10:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
if we add a limit for the amount of reports someone can read each day/week they'll start getting backed up


[19-Feb-20 10:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
i personally think its fine the way it is, and like mack said, its just an activity guideline, not a requirement as such

[19-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bman#0435

[19-Feb-20 05:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm actually talking to him right now about his suspension.


[19-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bman#0435

[19-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bman#0435

[19-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bman#0435
and then decided to take a poll


[19-Feb-20 05:39 PM] bman#0435
funny thing is my computer turns on when it moves, and my watch automatically turns it on


[19-Feb-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't enjoy on how he's taking Darren's situation to cope with his suspension, it's not a good look.


[19-Feb-20 05:39 PM] emma;#1525
@bman we don’t fire MRs without talking to@them first


[19-Feb-20 05:39 PM] bman#0435

I mean I’m not happy with flurry


[19-Feb-20 06:08 PM] emma;#1525
AT ALL


[19-Feb-20 06:08 PM] emma;#1525
But I don’t think we can hold 2017 mistakes against him, considering that was 3 years ago now and account sharing is extremely common on roblox


[19-Feb-20 06:09 PM] emma;#1525
The exploiting and limited buying is concerning but ultimately if roblox didn’t handle it back then I’m not sure we should now


[19-Feb-20 06:09 PM] emma;#1525
That’s just my opinion though


[19-Feb-20 06:09 PM] emma;#1525
And I’d appreciate being notified of whatever everyone else thinks BEFORE a final choice is made


[19-Feb-20 06:14 PM] ethan;#0003
O


[19-Feb-20 06:14 PM] ethan;#0003
Furry account shared?


[19-Feb-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
In 2018 lol


[19-Feb-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
But if it’s his brother that’s another story


[19-Feb-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
If his brother was just playing normal games


[19-Feb-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
That’s a totally other story


[19-Feb-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
I understand if his brother was doing shifts and going to sessions for him, but that’s not the case


[19-Feb-20 06:16 PM] bman#0435
ethan


[19-Feb-20 06:16 PM] bman#0435
he let his brothe on his account because "he doesnt know much about it"


[19-Feb-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
Because his brother couldn’t make his own account


[19-Feb-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
So he let him use his


[19-Feb-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
And it was in 2018


[19-Feb-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
That’s 2 years ago


[19-Feb-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
When he first joined


[19-Feb-20 06:18 PM] ethan;#0003
He shouldn’t be punished for that if it was his brother who didn’t even go on bloxton 2 years ago


[19-Feb-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, we can't hold that against him.


[19-Feb-20 06:18 PM] ethan;#0003
And the exploiting usd buying we can’t do anything about


[19-Feb-20 06:18 PM] ethan;#0003
A ton of mrs usd boy


[19-Feb-20 06:18 PM] ethan;#0003
Buy


[19-Feb-20 06:19 PM] ethan;#0003
If they get banned on roblox that is their fault

Can we get a revote


[19-Feb-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not really a need now, it's very clear that these are very old.


[19-Feb-20 06:20 PM] ethan;#0003
The 5 who voted yes


[19-Feb-20 06:21 PM] ethan;#0003
They won’t understand


[19-Feb-20 06:21 PM] ethan;#0003
Unless I tag or something


[19-Feb-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well, that's why I'm here.


[19-Feb-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I could basically explain it to them that this isn't very relevant.


[19-Feb-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003

[19-Feb-20 07:43 PM] bman#0435
@Polk does cohosting a session count as attending. ive been told that it doesnt but some people thinks that it does so can u clarify


[19-Feb-20 07:43 PM] bman#0435
and then depending on the answer can i inform the seniors abt it too


[19-Feb-20 07:48 PM] Polk#1596
yea


[19-Feb-20 07:48 PM] Polk#1596
cohosting can be considered as attending


[19-Feb-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
k ill tell dem senior dat


[19-Feb-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk @bman the whole point of “attending” is that they ARENT hosting...


[19-Feb-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
We literally had a talk about this lol


[19-Feb-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
They can’t do half the work and get full credit for attending


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank Ethan don't even say where I got the idea from, we know


Should we allow. People to appeal their warns in tickets


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
It barely should count as a hosting credit let alone an attendance credit


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 yes bc DMs suck


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Discord warns


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Okk


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
If Emma agrees I'm sure u all agree

[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525

[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
but what if they have 8 warnings


[19-Feb-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
@bman answer my ping first


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
also if they attedn they technically are just assisting the host


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
attending and assisting are the same


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
No they’re co hosting


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
That's the point bman :


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
They’re doing half of the host work


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
And 0 manager work


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
If they have old warnings and want to avoid ban


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
and what do managers do


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
They appeal


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
Managers do 100% of the Manager work


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
managers do a lot more than a co-hosting senior pair lol


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] Polk#1596
listen emma


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] Polk#1596
min said something along the lines of


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
What should be the suitable amount of time to appeal warnings


[19-Feb-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
they arent the ones that are hosting the actual session


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
Yes they are that’s the point of co hosting


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
They host TOGETHER


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] bman#0435
theyre just helping the host


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
90 days since last warning?


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] bman#0435
hm


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
Bman do you not know what cohosting is


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] Polk#1596
"cohosting counts as attending as long as they dont go afk right after"


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] bman#0435
90 is like 3 months


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
30 days since last warning if it was a minor violation and you ha e only 1 warning


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] bman#0435
so ye


[19-Feb-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525

AHH i was being shot at in my ridealong


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
how does cohosting as a senior (splitting one job between two people) count as the same as a manager does


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
Please explain


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
If they’re assisting as a manager then they aren’t co hosting


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] bman#0435
u split who names what as a manager


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
There is a big difference


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah but they supervise the whole time


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
Hosts typically don’t, Ive almost never seen a host actively doing stuff when I join them


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And plus, they're already mentioned on the Trello board.


[19-Feb-20 08:07 PM] Polk#1596
emma i think thats why min said


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] Polk#1596
as long as they dont go afk


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] Polk#1596
like for example


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] Polk#1596
supervise the stations


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
What trey


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk but what’s the difference between co hosting and attending as a manager


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
To me it means two seniors are EQUAL as hosts and splitting the duties of one job


[19-Feb-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
Whereas assisting means they’re doing a manager’s job which is designed to be split multiple ways anyways


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
If y’all are assuming cohosting means they’re acting as a manager that’s fine but we need to clarify


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
i mean


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
lets say


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
im cohosting with bman


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
and we figured out that im doing the rules


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
i will still help out with the grammar test


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
and once im done with the rules


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
i will supervise the interview offices


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
that’s great if that’s what you decide


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] Polk#1596
idk what more u want them to do


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
But most co hosts DONT do that


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
Unless there aren’t any managers


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Couldn't we run with a voting before we go along with this? @bonnie591


[19-Feb-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
In which case they shouldn’t be co hosting anyway


[19-Feb-20 08:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma said yes trey


[19-Feb-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
haven’t you heard I’m the new chairman


[19-Feb-20 08:11 PM] bonnie591#0591

[20-Feb-20 12:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
do u think we should make a rule where u have to type at least 5 letters before kicking someone because it’s been happening sm lately


[20-Feb-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
What if the name is 4 letters


[20-Feb-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
Or atleast 4 letters


[20-Feb-20 12:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
and excess at trainings, some trainees get kicked cause managers type 2-3 letters


[20-Feb-20 12:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
ok Ethan well if the name is 4 letters then 4 letters is all u can do -__-


[20-Feb-20 12:01 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I’ll attack you instead then @xM_inn


[20-Feb-20 12:02 PM] ethan;#0003
Becus what if it’s 3 letters


[20-Feb-20 12:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let's fire her @xM_inn


[20-Feb-20 12:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
....


[20-Feb-20 12:02 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; ty for the reactions maam


[20-Feb-20 12:03 PM] a. ღ#4222
don’t ignore me -__-


[20-Feb-20 12:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't you dare


[20-Feb-20 12:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uhhh


[20-Feb-20 12:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm I'm conflicted with that one chief


[20-Feb-20 12:04 PM] a. ღ#4222
K why


[20-Feb-20 12:04 PM] a. ღ#4222
ok*


[20-Feb-20 12:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here's the thing tho


[20-Feb-20 12:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What are the consequences for it


[20-Feb-20 12:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
probably nothing major lol , I just think it’s annoying because it’s been happening sm when all u have to do is type 1-2 more letters and nothing bad happens


[20-Feb-20 12:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
i think ppl rush at trying to remove the said player from the server that they dont realize their name


[20-Feb-20 12:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
But it also happens at trainings too where when kicking excess 1-2 trainees are kicked because they only type like 2-3 letters


[20-Feb-20 12:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
I don’t know, personally I think typing 4-5 letters just should be a thing because typing 2 letters more doesn’t take much time at all


[20-Feb-20 12:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah I get what ur saying they shouldn't be rushing to kick


[20-Feb-20 12:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bc some trainees/re trainees don't have discord to contact us that they were kicked on accident


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
then they kick all on accident like it's not hard to type 5 letters lol


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hence why I've never kicked all


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
or others before


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
tbh it doesnt happen as often as it used to


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
but vacs doc doesnt help this at all


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
they just say the first 3 letters


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
well let’s not have it happen at all then


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
what doc


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they shouldn't be making their own docs..


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
so it could say xxr as a kick and it would kick everyone with that


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
But I think that there were 3 instances in the past two days so


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
ya they r e.e


[20-Feb-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
lemme get a link


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah they are being really careless


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
It’s because


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
They know there isn’t consequences


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
exactly


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
So they don’t think about it


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
it's just getting more major


[20-Feb-20 12:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
What if there was a small consequence? Then they would pay attention

[20-Feb-20 12:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
..


[20-Feb-20 12:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
How many letters did he put


[20-Feb-20 12:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
why tf did he make that...


[20-Feb-20 12:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
kick scripts lmao


[20-Feb-20 12:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
that's not needed at all nor was he given permission


[20-Feb-20 12:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
Well does he need permission


[20-Feb-20 12:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
it's giving mrs the wrong info


[20-Feb-20 12:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I rly think there should be an announcement or a rule about it


[20-Feb-20 12:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
the only thing I've done on accident is kick random


[20-Feb-20 12:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bc I didn't know it was a thing


[20-Feb-20 12:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and I did it as a head


[20-Feb-20 12:16 PM] bman#0435
vac thinks he is bein helpful making all of these docs but its just annoying and unnecessary


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
Omg once


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
So


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ik


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
U know how u name


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
the recep trainees


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yes


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
“Training for recep “


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
I FUCKING


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] bman#0435
like i literally was updating mrs on the admin updates


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
KICKED THEM


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
FOR


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] bman#0435
AND HE MAKES A DOC WITH MY INFORMATION


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
U KICJED THEM DID-


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
LMFAOOO


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] bman#0435
omg stort-


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
“TRAINING FOR RECEP”


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
I FELT SO BAD


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
also I kicked people at interviews for “having safechat “


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
instead of “u failed “


[20-Feb-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
see I get accidents like that


[20-Feb-20 12:18 PM] bman#0435
LMAOOAOAOAO


[20-Feb-20 12:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
when I make a mistake I learn from it ok


[20-Feb-20 12:18 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I think if they keep continuing the mistake instead of learning from it they should be warned after a certain amount


[20-Feb-20 12:19 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bc there's really no excuse to keep doing the same mistake over and over when it's really simple to avoid it lmao

[20-Feb-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He tried to bring Darren's situation to cope with his suspension

why


[20-Feb-20 12:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because it was in 2018, we can't hold that against him


[20-Feb-20 12:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oh


[20-Feb-20 12:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

So trip is worried that managers are taking all the reports


[21-Feb-20 10:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
So maybe we can add some sort of limit or tell them not to hog the reports


[21-Feb-20 10:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] bman#0435
trip doesnt like doing rpeorts


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] bman#0435
shes always scared shell do something to the board


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
That’s basically bringing back report log again which is not something I want back again


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
Plus can’t managers get their own reports by going to the hotel


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but min said they still need to do reports they just don’t need to log it


[21-Feb-20 10:24 AM] stacey#1000

[21-Feb-20 10:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
We aint expecting 20 per manager


[21-Feb-20 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
Omg so last night I was playing Stapleton right, and this LR from Bloxton followed me into the game and kept bugging me asking if he could send me a appeal. I told him he can dm me one and then of course because he was bugging me I wasn’t going to read nor accept or deny his appeal at 1am. Legit I hate when people bug you to do stuff if you are enjoying time on another game at that time. Like I’ll do it if you don’t bug me to do it and when I get to it.


[21-Feb-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
And he just kept following me around asking me like 15 times


[21-Feb-20 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; you ever have people that do that to you on Stapleton


[21-Feb-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
Or any game


[21-Feb-20 11:33 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did you adjust your settings


[21-Feb-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
No


[21-Feb-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
My setting join was friends and this guy just found me on Stapleton


[21-Feb-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
And was only there to bug me


[21-Feb-20 11:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bruh moment


[21-Feb-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Me: running away from a cop 

This guy: following me “are you stacey? “Stacey can I appeal?” “STACEY.”


[21-Feb-20 11:35 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ugh


[21-Feb-20 11:35 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Reading that sounds so obnoxious


[21-Feb-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Here’s his appeal too. Like man no thanks not at 1:19am and not when you ruin my time playing Stapleton following me around and bugging me

I would decline this one.


[21-Feb-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
I just ain’t gonna reply to him


[21-Feb-20 11:36 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The remorse is there, but the appeal just screams out begging.


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
I annoyed of the way he trying to get me to appeal him


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not to mention, there's no responsibility for his actions honestly.


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, this kind of sucks.


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
DONT FOLLOW ME AROUND BUGGING ME ON STAPLETON MAYBE YOU WOULDVE GOTTEN APPEALED


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
Like bruh


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
This guy so stupid


[21-Feb-20 11:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
:shrug:


[21-Feb-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
Watch him start bugging you next for an appeal


[21-Feb-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey I HAVE PPL FROM BLOXTON FOLLOW ME IN STAPLETON


[21-Feb-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
THEY LITERALLY JUMP ON MY CRUSIER


[21-Feb-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
AND WONT GET OFF


[21-Feb-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
THEY SOMETIMES RUIN MY PURSUIT RPS CAUSE I CANT DRIVE WITH THEM ON MY CAR


[21-Feb-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Do they like follow you around asking you to do stuff for Bloxton


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
"when is the next training"


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
"can you read my DM please"


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
LMAO


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
"i need ranking"


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
yeah


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
It’s annoying


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
This guy FUCKING WOULDNT STOP ASKING FOR ME TO APPEAL HIM


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
the most annoying thing is that if they look hard enough, they're able to find the next training time!!!


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
LOL


[21-Feb-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
Even after I told him to dm me


[21-Feb-20 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
He was bugging me to read it and if he was getting accepted or not


[21-Feb-20 11:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
the plus side of being a cop though is that not everyone from bloxton recognizes me due to outfit change 😎


[21-Feb-20 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
My response was getting in my car and driving away


[21-Feb-20 11:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
one of the downsides of my cop outfit though is that when ppl draw fanart of me, it looks weird 😭 :flushed_cool: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550384317168353280/680456047424438339/Min.png

[21-Feb-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821

Because records clear in V3 right


[21-Feb-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821

[21-Feb-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821

[21-Feb-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821

the warden made it a policy to show our names because of multiple incidents of CO impersonators getting inside, so when people gets close enough they all go "Oh its you polk"


[21-Feb-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
@Polk @xM_inn can we make an announcement to everyone about following HRs into other games and bugging to do stuff for Bloxton and remind them they can DM us and that they should be patient.


[21-Feb-20 11:53 AM] Polk#1596
sure! as long as it is a friendly reminder, not a passive aggressive message to them


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I’ll write one then send it to you to see what you think

@High Rank Considering DMing a higher ranked HR at sizzleburger about Harriet, but I want to know if y’all still care or think we should drop it for now. 👍🏻 - DM and keep fighting.  🤦🏼‍♀️ - Drop it and don’t DM.

If most of y’all don’t care anymore there’s no point in me fighting it. I’m still pretty disgusted by it but my opinion doesn’t represent all of us, so just want to get a general idea. Ty

Honestly, I don't think they'll budge into terminating her, so I'll go with the 2nd.

It’s what you want to have happen


[21-Feb-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
If you want to keep fighting it because you don’t want her as a TA vote thumbs up


[21-Feb-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
If you don’t care if she’s an MR vote facepalm


[21-Feb-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
I already have the go ahead from Minn to keep talking to SB but I want to know if you all still want her termed or not

@High Rank darkqyx made this document about how to handle CBs, what do you guys think of this? Is there anything that needs changing and should this be announced? https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4NhC-PNB8-SHGUzdHVKzz-wQk69-vfHC69tld6DjeA/edit?usp=sharing

[22-Feb-20 11:13 AM] bman#0435
few concerns


[22-Feb-20 11:13 AM] katie#0200
no hes asking for my approval lool


[22-Feb-20 11:13 AM] bman#0435
1) we dont need 3 docs abt cbs


[22-Feb-20 11:13 AM] bman#0435
2) if that doc gets leaked then cbs will figure out questions for everything


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
they should question their behavior lmao


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but ya


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
3) its mainly for interviews so that isnt rly abt handling them its abt catchinf them


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i agree with you bman


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
i dont think we need that doc


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] katie#0200
me neither tbh 🤷‍♀️


[22-Feb-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
everyone has been capable to catch them


[22-Feb-20 11:15 AM] bman#0435
and if they arent sure they call the host


[22-Feb-20 11:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeahh


[22-Feb-20 11:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
this doc isn't needed


[22-Feb-20 11:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
good try but


[22-Feb-20 11:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
nah


[22-Feb-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
MRs should ask before MAKING a doc


[22-Feb-20 11:42 AM] emma;#1525
Like Slee did


[22-Feb-20 11:43 AM] emma;#1525
So it’s a no from me for that alone


[22-Feb-20 11:56 AM] katie#0200

[22-Feb-20 12:04 PM] emma;#1525
@katie can we make an announcement about doc making


[22-Feb-20 12:04 PM] emma;#1525
Here I’ll draft one and we can decide if we want to or not


[22-Feb-20 12:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm i have an announcement i was thinking off for the public


[22-Feb-20 12:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's basically 2 things i thought of that's kind of bothering me


[22-Feb-20 12:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) many people cuffing to those wearing the LR uniform


[22-Feb-20 12:09 PM] emma;#1525
**Making Help Docs**

MRs,

Recently we’ve had multiple MRs approach us with documents they’ve made that they want us to publish for the whole team to use. While we are glad so many of you want to help, there are some issues we run into.

Many times, the docs either contain “secret” information that even though we all know, if leaked would harm us all (I.e. anything about CBs or the boards), or are otherwise pretty redundant or unnecessary.

In the future, if any of you would like to create a document for ANY reason, you need to get approval from the HRs in advance or it will be denied. We do not want you guys to waste your time making a doc just for us to deny it anyways, and we want to know what documents are being created in advance.

Chances are if you approach us with an idea, we’ll approve it. We may simply need to refine exactly what you’re writing about to make sure it’s safe.

If you have a document idea or any questions, please let us know!

Emma


[22-Feb-20 12:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) many people also cuffing for inappropriate attire even though it's not the human skin tone


[22-Feb-20 12:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ooo


[22-Feb-20 12:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i like that announcement


[22-Feb-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
go for it


[22-Feb-20 12:10 PM] emma;#1525
Instead of inappropriate attire why don’t we say “inappropriate attire that imitates nudity, profanity, or other purposefully R rated material”


[22-Feb-20 12:10 PM] emma;#1525
Like let’s make that rule more specific


[22-Feb-20 12:10 PM] emma;#1525
And see if it helps


[22-Feb-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
see that's a bot confusing given that users like emma show up


[22-Feb-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bit*


[22-Feb-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know they're a CB but like


[22-Feb-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
others get cuffed for similar avatars like her


[22-Feb-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i see where you're going tho


[22-Feb-20 12:12 PM] emma;#1525
what’s Emma’s avatar


[22-Feb-20 12:12 PM] emma;#1525

idk what to do lol


[22-Feb-20 08:43 PM] emma;#1525
@bman I mean she was kicked on the security line


[22-Feb-20 08:43 PM] emma;#1525
so it looks like she was probably passed incorrectly


[22-Feb-20 08:43 PM] emma;#1525
i'd just rerank her


[22-Feb-20 08:43 PM] emma;#1525
since it shows she was standing on the sec line and not the bar line


[22-Feb-20 08:43 PM] emma;#1525
you could also ask whoever was the sec trainer


[22-Feb-20 08:45 PM] bman#0435

@RAMMGaming this girl is really trying to convince me that she knows secret information


[23-Feb-20 01:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
such as what


[23-Feb-20 01:39 AM] emma;#1525
"I know the exact date someone's suspension was lifted"


[23-Feb-20 01:39 AM] emma;#1525
but she'd previously said that person told her


[23-Feb-20 01:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I think a guy named javi is in on it too


[23-Feb-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
and people can access their suspension cards through the user interface boards at the TC and IC


[23-Feb-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
lmao


[23-Feb-20 01:40 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[23-Feb-20 01:46 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[23-Feb-20 04:07 AM] ethan;#0003
@emma; what happened


[23-Feb-20 04:10 AM] stacey#1000
LMAO I love how that fake person that made the tea server assumes I promoted Megan, grace, and blaire because I’m friends with them. LMAO. If they actually did research they would’ve known bliss promoted blaire to head, Polk promoted grace to manager, and yes I promoted Megan to senior but of course they will never know the whole hr team voted on it. Proof people are jealous I have real friends that aren’t fake and our usernames prove it. B))


[23-Feb-20 04:15 AM] ethan;#0003
LOL


[23-Feb-20 04:19 AM] stacey#1000
Should I join that tea server on my alt discord account


[23-Feb-20 04:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and they didnt know that actually cause i dont even meet megan at all

[23-Feb-20 05:49 AM] ethan;#0003
Wow lmao they are bringing up the tea doc from months ago


[23-Feb-20 05:50 AM] ethan;#0003
And I love how everything in that doc is completely out of context


[23-Feb-20 06:16 AM] Polk#1596
Madi told me ur going legal and going to apply for a department, is that true! @stacey


[23-Feb-20 07:39 AM] stacey#1000
In V3 yeah


[23-Feb-20 07:39 AM] stacey#1000
@Polk


[23-Feb-20 07:39 AM] stacey#1000
When V3 comes out and my record clears!


[23-Feb-20 07:39 AM] stacey#1000
In April!


[23-Feb-20 07:44 AM] Polk#1596
OH


[23-Feb-20 07:44 AM] Polk#1596
YEAH


[23-Feb-20 07:44 AM] Polk#1596

[23-Feb-20 08:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
bot is down again


[23-Feb-20 08:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828

Rover?


[23-Feb-20 08:53 AM] ethan;#0003
It goes down like everyday


[23-Feb-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll probably start off with dot or DPW. If I do post and get in I’ll probably apply for fsp or sheriff department @Polk


[23-Feb-20 09:03 AM] bman#0435

[23-Feb-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
Hi


[23-Feb-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
When I get home I’m joining that fake Bloxton tea server on my alt account


[23-Feb-20 09:03 AM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming boi i hope u know i literally sent the link right before u got it lol


[23-Feb-20 09:04 AM] stacey#1000
I got an alt account on discord for when I did dot and post then quit


[23-Feb-20 09:04 AM] stacey#1000
Because id rather do it on my main acc


[23-Feb-20 09:07 AM] stacey#1000
Minimalistic getting banned from my discord server rn


[23-Feb-20 09:07 AM] stacey#1000
Since she’s the bitch that made that server


[23-Feb-20 09:10 AM] stacey#1000
Omg what should the reason for her ban be this will be good

[23-Feb-20 09:11 AM] bman#0435
why tf is ban right above transfer ownership


[23-Feb-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
Idk


[23-Feb-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
What should I put as ban reason


[23-Feb-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
I want it to be good


[23-Feb-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
Cause she will get notified she was banned by the bot


[23-Feb-20 09:12 AM] stacey#1000
It’s exciting I get to actually ban her


[23-Feb-20 09:13 AM] stacey#1000
Reason for ban: Crying out for attention and making a “Bloxton Tea” server and making assumptions against people, bye bye hun you ain’t welcome in this server.


[23-Feb-20 09:13 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll do something like that


[23-Feb-20 09:13 AM] bman#0435
idk


[23-Feb-20 09:13 AM] bman#0435
ya


[23-Feb-20 09:13 AM] bman#0435
do that


[23-Feb-20 09:13 AM] bman#0435
lol


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] bman#0435
wait


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] bman#0435
i dont think shell see the reason


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
She will


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] bman#0435
o ok


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
Because she will get a dm


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
By the bot I have


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] bman#0435
ooo


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
And say you were banned for this reason


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
It’s like how people get notified they were warned with the reason


[23-Feb-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
So legit we could basically roast her with the ban reason


[23-Feb-20 09:15 AM] stacey#1000
So if anyone wants to ban her from my server and put a great roast as the reason for the ban tag me


[23-Feb-20 09:15 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I didn’t do it yet


[23-Feb-20 09:15 AM] stacey#1000
I need a great reason for the ban


[23-Feb-20 09:20 AM] Polk#1596
cries no one goes for doc


[23-Feb-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t want to


[23-Feb-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
I want fsp


[23-Feb-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
Or sheriff


[23-Feb-20 09:30 AM] Polk#1596
im going to apply for FSP now


[23-Feb-20 09:30 AM] Polk#1596
doc is a secondary department


[23-Feb-20 09:49 AM] ethan;#0003
dont apply for sherrif


[23-Feb-20 09:49 AM] ethan;#0003
sherrif is shit


[23-Feb-20 09:49 AM] ethan;#0003
they have the most rouges


[23-Feb-20 09:49 AM] ethan;#0003
and they have the worst reputation


[23-Feb-20 09:59 AM] ethan;#0003
@Polk I’ve been legal for 2 weeks


[23-Feb-20 09:59 AM] ethan;#0003
But this dumb ass judge that did bonnies case in one day has not replied in 2 weeks


[23-Feb-20 10:03 AM] Polk#1596
ooh


[23-Feb-20 10:03 AM] Polk#1596
what do u need the judge for @ethan;


[23-Feb-20 10:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank Edit rule 5 by removing any type of disturbance part due to it being a loophole?


[23-Feb-20 10:05 AM] Tattoblue#5828
howz it a loophole


[23-Feb-20 10:06 AM] bman#0435
@Tattoblue he thinks breathing is also a disturbance


[23-Feb-20 10:12 AM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 CAN YOU HELP ME THIS FUCKING DUMB ASS JEFFASSASS JUDGE FUCKING ASS


[23-Feb-20 10:12 AM] ethan;#0003

no jef is my friend


[23-Feb-20 10:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
@Tattoblue A disturbance to me can be chatting in the chat


[23-Feb-20 10:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
A disturbance to the guy over there is not chatting in the chat


[23-Feb-20 10:22 AM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 but we can just not enforce that


[23-Feb-20 10:22 AM] ethan;#0003
because like who tf would actualy warn for that


[23-Feb-20 10:24 AM] bonnie591#0591
Me


[23-Feb-20 10:24 AM] bonnie591#0591

[23-Feb-20 10:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
hell no


[23-Feb-20 10:24 AM] bonnie591#0591
If I wanna warn someone for something then I just use rule 5


[23-Feb-20 10:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
@ethan; is that from the sonic movie


[23-Feb-20 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003

I'm linus from linus tech tips and I'll be talking about some of the ways that living room gaming is better than ever. With a samsung QLED tv, not only can you see more than ever before but at 4k resolution with sizes of up to 82 inches the image clarity is unbelievable

Unfortunately we don't have - 80


[23-Feb-20 07:33 PM] katie#0200
I just don’t really see any more than 1 good candidate but yeahh


[23-Feb-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
i mean i want a new hr


[23-Feb-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000

[23-Feb-20 07:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
If its a tie between 0 and 2 then I'll just hire 1


[23-Feb-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
there i changed vote to 1


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
OOOO


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] katie#0200
I don’t think we should force ourselves to hire more than the amount of good candidates


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ill look at the result tomorrow


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
i only see 1 good candidate too really


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000

[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
i want new hr but at same time


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we need 30 shift managers


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
maybe madi for aest


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
i only see 1 good candidate but who knows how active they would be.


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
we've been fine


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
we didnt lose any hrs


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
and we've been fine


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
like if they decide to host every second of every day then we lose our activity balances


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
by selling the rank


[23-Feb-20 07:34 PM] katie#0200
Omg madi takes like 10 years to put up passers I’ve had to remind her before


[23-Feb-20 07:35 PM] bman#0435
we didnt lose anyone and that keeps out activity balance which runs pretty swelly


[23-Feb-20 07:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Dear shift managers,
UR fired so we can accommodate 90 new shift managers


[23-Feb-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000

[23-Feb-20 07:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
madi takes forever to put up passers bc she does something with excess


[23-Feb-20 07:36 PM] katie#0200
I’m not really comfortable with Anna or Emily being shifts yet


[23-Feb-20 07:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and it takes forever


[23-Feb-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591

@High Rank If everyone is so sure that alloe and oak are CBs, they should be fired. Some people think we *shouldn't* fire them because "we're wasting their time and they aren't trolling" but like we wouldn't let Iced, Harriet, Kaylee, etc do the same so I think that's pretty hypocritical. However I'll put it up to a vote. ✅ - Fire both  ❌ - Let them keep working  ❓ - We need more proof they are actually CBs 🍉 - fire trey and bman instead

Do you want to die @emma;


[26-Feb-20 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
We are all assuming they are CBs with no real evidence really


[26-Feb-20 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
So we can’t fire them for our own assumptions


[26-Feb-20 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
Like we never actually questioned them....?

[26-Feb-20 12:08 PM] stacey#1000
Should people really be asking people “vote me for best ___!” In general discussion....?


[26-Feb-20 12:08 PM] katie#0200
story is so active 😭


[26-Feb-20 12:08 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I don’t think people should be asking people to vote for them and just let people to vote for who they want


[26-Feb-20 12:08 PM] katie#0200
uhh i mean not really - wasnt there a rule or something like that last year?


[26-Feb-20 12:08 PM] stacey#1000
Just my opinion


[26-Feb-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll announce it


[26-Feb-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000
If I can

[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah that seems like a good idea


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
Okay can I announce it?


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
No need to ping though, just add a message onto bonnies announcement


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
Since he already pinged


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
Yes!


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] bman#0435
people did it last year lol


[26-Feb-20 12:10 PM] bman#0435
i dont see y u cant


[26-Feb-20 12:12 PM] Polk#1596
From what I remember from the past two awards I've been to, it always got out of hand in the end with people asking others to vote for them. It's better to let people just vote for whoever they want to vote


[26-Feb-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
Someone might even go out of their way to buy votes from other people with robux


[26-Feb-20 12:13 PM] bman#0435
i thought last year bonnie didnt care unless u paid people to vote for u


[26-Feb-20 12:14 PM] Polk#1596
Well that's bonnie


[26-Feb-20 12:14 PM] stacey#1000
Some people get really upset over it to if they don’t win and it makes no sense


[26-Feb-20 12:14 PM] stacey#1000
Like last year I remember some people that didn’t win best Lr awards


[26-Feb-20 12:14 PM] Polk#1596
I think it’s for the better not to let everyone spam pictures and say "VOTE FOR ME" because it gets annoying real quick


[26-Feb-20 12:15 PM] stacey#1000
And they got mad they didn’t win. People don’t remember this is for fun and that even if you don’t win you still mean a lot to Bloxton. Like...idk some people just get competitive I guess


[26-Feb-20 12:27 PM] katie#0200
darky wants to know if ppl are allowed to ask for people to vote for them in servers that aren't bloxton

@High Rank Fun fact y'all are voting we need more evidence alloe and oak are CBs, even though that's all you've alll been saying for months??? Wild. Anyways, I am suffering from an injury rn so I really don't have time to collect evidence between doctors visits so y'all need to figure out who is gonna get more evidence and if there's not sufficient evidence that they are CBs in like two weeks then I'm either firing them or promoting them 😄 y'all wanted to vote me scariest HR well here we go woooooo

@High Rank ok but seriously tho, curious to know how many of you would want to *consider* reviewing (aka maybe stopping) our alliance with SB. They've proven time and time again they won't do anything for us and literally trust liars and spammers more than us, and don't really put any effort into us it seems. Not saying we're unallying bc obvs that's not up to me lol just wondering how y'all feel ok thx

If you want to place them under review then sure, but don't take that vote as an unalliance voting option

[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
how


[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
what does kinda piss me off though is we'd instantly fire/suspend one of our LRs if they trolled at SB


[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
who


[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
or any alliance for that matter


[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming real question tho


[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[26-Feb-20 07:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
i dont know why sb are suddenly being stubborn with their punishments

[26-Feb-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
your argument of "alliance visits" is invalid


[26-Feb-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
bc they dont even do it for us


[26-Feb-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Feb-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Feb-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525

stacey


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my PSAT score reeked of lack of practice


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
they literally didnt fire harriet with all that proof


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so that's an L


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
and refused to fire an lr for spamming at my interviews


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
1) didnt listen to me at all about harriet lying on her report 2) didnt give me a chance to explain anything after i asked 3) believed her over us 4) i sent them proof from THAT DAY of harriet trying to figure out a leaker and they ignored it


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
and claim that their lrs dont represent their group


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
5) their LR was spamming today and sb refused to do anything


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
BUT THE LRS MAKE UP THEIR  GROUP


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
bc "lrs dont represent them"


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
so they can spam our group and not get in trouble


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
apparently


[26-Feb-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
omg lets raid sb 🥰

[27-Feb-20 12:12 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
LyooFXToday at 2:11 AM
then u refresh the user, if the vr thing disapears and the user gets his hair and hats back

@xAfroTrey no we're just deciding on whether we want any of them as an alliance


[27-Feb-20 08:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
so like if all three had good visit reports and baby approved then they'd all become alliances

[28-Feb-20 06:38 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I think there will be waaaay more staff than guests at the hotel


[28-Feb-20 06:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828
We could always set up a staff limit like 3 receptionist, 2 or 1 housekeeping and 2 bar or something like that


[28-Feb-20 06:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828
And 2 mrs


[28-Feb-20 06:39 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but they’re not really not gonna listen to that are they


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Tattoblue#5828
A lot do when an MR or HR asks dem to serverhop


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Tattoblue#5828
But it’d be a pain


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
A lot don’t too


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
And


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
They would want to be with us


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
In our servers


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Crowding for promo


[28-Feb-20 06:40 AM] Tattoblue#5828
:PittyViolin:


[28-Feb-20 06:41 AM] Cooqkie#2809
And when there’s an hr in a server


[28-Feb-20 06:41 AM] Cooqkie#2809
The Lrs bring the ppl they cuff to us


[28-Feb-20 06:41 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Instead of the mrs


[28-Feb-20 06:43 AM] stacey#1000
There has been really full servers before and it’s always all staff and like 3 hotel guests and it’s a pretty boring shift.


[28-Feb-20 06:51 AM] stacey#1000
Plus I don’t agree with more than 3 MRs being on one.


[28-Feb-20 06:51 AM] stacey#1000
And LRs these are there would only be there because HRs or MRs are there


[28-Feb-20 06:51 AM] stacey#1000
So yeah I think we shouldn’t do that huge shift on one server. It won’t be good


[28-Feb-20 07:20 AM] bman#0435
they wont listen. ive joined a server during one to find 5 mrs, probably 2-3 beinf seniors, in one server


[28-Feb-20 08:49 AM] xM_inn#2821

Thank you all so much for attending this event! 

It was super fun, but it was definitely a lot of work. It's been a project for a few days now, but I managed to edit it all in 6-7 hours so I could upload it as soon as possible. Let's do this again sometime! :D

@High Rank Who unbanned Dais_ies from the Bloxton Discord????


[28-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't.


[28-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Either way, did you ban her? @xM_inn


[28-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
I can't see anything in the audit log so just checking.


[28-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
No, I'll ban her now.


[28-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, got it.


[28-Feb-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hold it, are you sure she didn't circumvent again? @xM_inn


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or use some type of different account?


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'm sure, she's on her main account


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
Maddie.
#1417


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
Never unbanned daisies


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
Cause she’s blacklisted is she not


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep, that's her main.


[28-Feb-20 11:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Absolutely, she doesn't deserve an unban. Ever.


[28-Feb-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
The last person I unbanned from the discord was kelly who appealed


[28-Feb-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
She was never blacklisted tho


[28-Feb-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
Daisy on the other hand


[28-Feb-20 11:50 AM] bman#0435
i didnt


[28-Feb-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
No thanks


[28-Feb-20 11:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fuck her, honestly.


[28-Feb-20 11:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I really despise her selfish attitude and behavior.


[28-Feb-20 11:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She keeps doing this "I'm going to improve" or "I didn't do anything for (insert months here) so you should appeal me" narrative, and fails to improve.


[28-Feb-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah honestly idk how she got unbanned


[28-Feb-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
Yep


[28-Feb-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
Sounds like her


[28-Feb-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
And sounds like a whole handful of others


[28-Feb-20 11:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
JBeyonce does the same shit too.


[28-Feb-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
There is a whole handful of toxic formers


[28-Feb-20 11:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
And calling them both out gives me a goddamn headache.


[28-Feb-20 11:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh, and Esha too. 🙄


[28-Feb-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
And Ava


[28-Feb-20 11:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk how to unban ppl from discord


[28-Feb-20 11:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's really easy on desktop Cookie lol


[28-Feb-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
It’s easy on mobile too


[28-Feb-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
I unbanned kelly on mobile


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn daisies is planned


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003
Planned


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003
P banned


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003
Never


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003
She is a threat to the Groupon


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003
GROUP


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Quite an asshole too.


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
She’s blacklisted for a reason


[28-Feb-20 11:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's blacklisted for so many reasons.


[28-Feb-20 11:58 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[28-Feb-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan; ik which is why im asking why she was unbanned


[28-Feb-20 11:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh yeah minn


[28-Feb-20 11:58 AM] stacey#1000
Was she only unbanned from the discord?


[28-Feb-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
i think so


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah idk


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
could i comment no appeals permitted on whoever was on that chat blacklisted on the api board @xM_inn


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
only the ones mainly involved


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
i blacklisted everyone in the server


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
but some were just in the server so they can appeal in one month


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] ethan;#0003
Wait someone unbanned her-


[28-Feb-20 11:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
yes ethan


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
Look at logs


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
i did, nothing


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
In the discord settings


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You should probably mention who I should give no appeals to though. @xM_inn


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll decide with you on who deserves it.


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] bman#0435
@Polk u skipped over a username when ranking. i ranked them for u and checked to make sure they werent demoted or left the group and rejoined


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
Did you check the HR board


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] bman#0435
lanaunicorn230


[28-Feb-20 12:00 PM] ethan;#0003
Because ban appeals should be on there


[28-Feb-20 12:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright, so.


[28-Feb-20 12:01 PM] stacey#1000
Does it say when she was unbanned


[28-Feb-20 12:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
JBeyonce deserves no chances, so that's one down.


[28-Feb-20 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
Ava deserves no chances too


[28-Feb-20 12:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Too late.


[28-Feb-20 12:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I already decided that out, lol.


[28-Feb-20 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
Good


[28-Feb-20 12:03 PM] Polk#1596
ty! :D @bman


[28-Feb-20 12:07 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn unless she made a new discord and used a VPN


[28-Feb-20 12:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
@xAfroTrey okie dm me who


[28-Feb-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
omg dais_ies was unbanned? bruh


[28-Feb-20 12:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
nobody unbanned her tho


[28-Feb-20 12:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
vpn probs


[28-Feb-20 12:27 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Can we change how we do warning appeals? Y’all doing it like courtrooms and letting MRs who aren’t appealing be involved is unprofessional af and I’ve already got a few concerned DMs about it thanks


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525
And not using grammar ^^^^^


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
thats bonnies process so


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
id ask bonnie and not everyone


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
considering like 4 hrs have reviewed them


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
I tried


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
Too confusing


[28-Feb-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
it isnt confusing


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
they state y their warning should be appealed


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
an mr reviews it


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
we decide final outcome


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] ethan;#0003
How do you pick the MR


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
then close ticket


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
i have them choose


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
and if they dont care


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
i use random number generaator and go down palyer list


[28-Feb-20 12:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
i mean honestly its up to you how you do it as long as u follow the criteria


[28-Feb-20 12:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it should be only us doing them.


[28-Feb-20 12:30 PM] bman#0435
it gives us an opportunity to see what mrs are capable of when reviewing that stuff and making decisions so


[28-Feb-20 12:30 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[28-Feb-20 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
and im picking mrs if the person wants it to be decided by an mr. i like it when people pick mrs because then i havent got the tough decision of saying no (usually yes because im nice)


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
We need to figure out how to not make them public


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know, that seems a bit too much.


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
And we shouldn’t be letting MRs be involved at all Bonnie


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
Unless they’re the ones appealing


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
why not


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe it's just me, but it seems like a lot of responsibility for them.


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
explain why


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
Bc they aren’t HRs...?


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] bman#0435
we change the @everyone setting to cant view lol


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
does it matter?


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
no it doesnt


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
Yes...?


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, it kind of does.


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
hm well how about we allow seniors to give opinions instead of just MRs


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
We don’t let MRs decide ban appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
seniors are technically "trial-hrs"


[28-Feb-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
We don’t let MRs decide discord appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] ethan;#0003
I still don’t understand


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
No they’re senior MRs, they don’t get to know classified info lol


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] bman#0435
ur telling me imag has been a trial-hr for like 2 years


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] bman#0435
LMAOOOOOOOOOOO


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
LMAOOO


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
LOL


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
OMG BMAN-


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
😂😂😂


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
hold on let be go read the hilton handbook we have that states that we cant allow mrs to decide **WARNING** appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
when was the hilton handbook updated


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
to do warning appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 does it specifically state they can’t decide other appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
Pretty sure the handbook isn’t updated


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
Or good


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
warnings arent classified, managements warn people, why cant they get involved?


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 can’t u change the handbook


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
do we even have a handbook?


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] ethan;#0003
No


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
Because letting 30 managements get involved in appeals is a bad idea lmao


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] ethan;#0003
I don’t think so


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
exact;y


[28-Feb-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
And everyone else seems to be agreeing


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
also if its a false warning we should at least get that mr's opinion on y it was false or real


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] ethan;#0003
So there is nothing saying seniors can’t


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
30 managements?


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, 30.


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
i wouldn't mind seniors being involved


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
not sure about the whole MR team


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
even lrs are representing


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; there’s nothing stating MRs can’t help with other appeals either and we don’t let them do that


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
i remember when we have like 40-50 managers omg


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Jx_sy represented like 2 ppl


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh yeah let me find the most recent appeal where i let 30 managements decide


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The whole MR Team seems like a bad idea.


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh wait, i only let 5 people max usually do it


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
Bonnie that’s not what I meant and you know it


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
Can you act a bit more mature right now


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
5 people?


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
no thank you


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
You’re playing a defensive kid who just got told he can’t have a cookie after dinner


[28-Feb-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
Like seriously


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
I just think it’s too much for appeal warnings, if it was appealing a ban or a kick that’s more reasonable


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
i dont see an issue with how bonnie does his appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
it might be different than usual but i dont see how it could have negative impacts


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thank you bman


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
LOL


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
I’ve seen a ton of cards where more than 3-4 people were involved in the choice


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
And it’s not okay


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
no cooqkies for u @bonnie591


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds pretty disorganized.


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
discord doesnt have cards emma 😔


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
It looks disorganized


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
And it’s disrespectful to whoever is appealing


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
Because you’re making it a show


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
and i thought u were smarter than me


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
😔


[28-Feb-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
Since they’re all public


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Great to see you have an opinion emma


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] emma;#1525
Great to see you not even willing to consider it


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Mhm


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] emma;#1525
So tf am I doing here then lol


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] emma;#1525
If you’re not willing to work as a team


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] Polk#1596
emma, not all of the appeals are public


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] Polk#1596
i mean we can ask them


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] Polk#1596
if they want to appeal public or private


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] Polk#1596
but they start off as being private


[28-Feb-20 12:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
A better question is tf am I doing contributing New ideas here


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
instead of arguing over two different things, why dont we come to a compromise of some sort instead


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
Bonnie I didn’t say your idea was bad I said it needs to be revised bc I’ve had some concerned DMs


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok the appeal public thing I'm willing to change but not mrs


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
who sent u concerns abt it


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why not?


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
and what did they say


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
If you’re dead set on letting an MR help out we can work that out but you can’t just let random MRs get involved


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
Because they want to play minimod for the day


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
because if u told us that then maybe bonnie would consider a minor change


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] emma;#1525
But we don’t let MRs assist in any other appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, I pretty much disagree on them being involved.


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok then what about seniors then


[28-Feb-20 12:36 PM] bman#0435
but u rnt saying what those complainers said


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm, I'm somewhat okay with Seniors.


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ban appeals are most serve


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
I mean why let a senior be involved if they don’t know why the warning was given, didn’t see it, etc


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Warnings are warnings and most warnings are given by mrs


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
Most ban requests are given by MRs lol


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
We still don’t let them be involved


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Requests


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
🤷🏼‍♀️


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
arguably the HR reading the appeal wouldn't know why the warning was given, didn’t see it, etc


[28-Feb-20 12:37 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah and do you look deeper into band before doing it or just go off the card


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
None because I don't do them


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, more than likely, I would just ask the original person. @xM_inn


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] emma;#1525
Ok but then no letting other MRs be involved


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
i mean, lets not forget these are only discord warning appeals, it's not like they're ban appeals


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] bman#0435
i like the current system because it shows us what the mrs r capable of...


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
can we agree on seniors only for discord warning appeals, and no publicity?


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] bman#0435
id be okay with management+ instead


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] emma;#1525
And the MR who gave the warning can only be involved if the HR wants clarification


[28-Feb-20 12:38 PM] ethan;#0003
I have idea


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
and what emma just said


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I like that idea, Minn.


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
So no to just seniors bc they don’t even give out most of the warnings


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm fine with it being private since I cba to change the settings anyway


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
Only one MR is allowed to be involved, if other opinions are needed (bc various MRs warn) that can happen in DMs


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
i think seniors only, no publicity, and only allowing the MR who issued the warning to be involved for clarification seems like a proposal


[28-Feb-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
Too many cooks spoil the broth ya know 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
No no no


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's raw @emma;


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
We aren’t doing seniors are involved AND a second MR


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
it’s one or the other lol


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
ooh


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
ok


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
hm


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] ethan;#0003
We make a new section called “needs second review” where a second HR will come and review it and then if the second HR and the first HR both think that they should get the warnings removed then they do. This would take out the whole confusing part of finding MRs and sorting all that out


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think a senior should be involved if they didn’t give the warning


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
5 Mrs is a good number


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, that's way too much.


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
Bonnie if you’re not gonna be productive you can leave


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] bman#0435
trey did u just say 5 mrs is too much


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
Because you’re being immature about this and we’re fixing your problem


[28-Feb-20 12:40 PM] bman#0435
do u remember in 2018 how many head receps we had...


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
i think just seniors then, personally. if the HR wants clarification from the person who warned, they can just DM.


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525
Don’t be a jack


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
I WAS THE 100TH HEAD RECEP


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
100TH


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman, I think Bonnie meant reviewing at the same time.


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525
But why have seniors involved if they have no idea what happened lol


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
ik but still


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
5 isnt much, especially if ur just seeing an opinion from each


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
i guess, but they also have the resources to look deeper into the warning, as do HRs @emma;


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
and also the HR would be the primary person reviewing the appeal & making the final decision


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525
managers and seniors can see the same things right


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
they arent going to decide the final outcome, we are


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525
Or can only seniors see bot logs


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
they just give us an opinon


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
5

This means we decrease chance of biased, more people to give an opinion


[28-Feb-20 12:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
seniors can see audit logs & ban people


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
Ah


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
1 Mr we get might be way too strict or too nice


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
Ok but I don’t want seniors involved unless the HR truly doesn’t know what to do


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
We already take 4 years to decide crap


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
what if the senior gave the warning...


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Anyway to point out


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then we contact them lol @bman


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
I've done around 100 appeals and only 2 chose mrs


[28-Feb-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
It doesn’t need to take longer than necessary bc we want the seniors to get minor “training” even though we all agree we don’t like any of them for HR lol


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True lol


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
seniors would probably appreciate the extra responsibility tbh


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
and to think yall wanted to promote 2 of them last week 🙄


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
maddy (star) would make a good shift


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
she dont listen tho


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah bc we want imag and Darren to be so involved


[28-Feb-20 12:43 PM] emma;#1525

[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
LOL


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
This is gonna be so biased


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bman she doesnt listen to what?


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn she has like 3 written warnings


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
Literally the same few seniors will be picked each time


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
directions


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
Bc no one wants to deal with half the team


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
she has 3 warnings because she doesnt listen


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Pretty sure Darren is winning for strictest mr


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
lol


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
And it’s gonna lead to jealousy


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] ethan;#0003
She doesn’t read dms


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
And we’re gonna have problems


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
And it’s not gonna be good


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
darren hasnt even been online for this year yet


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
But we need to protect Bonnie’s ego so I guess we’re doing it lol


[28-Feb-20 12:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[29-Feb-20 10:21 AM] bman#0435
I HAVENT SEEN ANOTHER MANAGER OR SENIOR ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION


[29-Feb-20 10:21 AM] bman#0435
IN A WHILE


[29-Feb-20 10:39 AM] Cooqkie#2809
hmm


[29-Feb-20 10:39 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@bman have the questions been consistent


[29-Feb-20 10:40 AM] Cooqkie#2809
like how long in between each question


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ehh


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think so tbh


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] bman#0435
very very very consistent


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] bman#0435
trey r u blind


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] bman#0435
literally EVERY question


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's not a big deal compared to reports really


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] bman#0435
check his logs int he server for quetions


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
did anyone complain about it yet


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] bman#0435
ok but some managers nay wanna answer some


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but questions are free for grabs


[29-Feb-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[29-Feb-20 10:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
kenzi just answered now lol


[29-Feb-20 10:43 AM] bman#0435
would be nice to at least have one other manager answer a single question considering lyoo thinks hes the king of questions


[29-Feb-20 10:43 AM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

ive been seeing it happen everyday


[29-Feb-20 10:45 AM] Polk#1596
um well


[29-Feb-20 10:45 AM] Polk#1596
i get that other managements want to answer questions


[29-Feb-20 10:45 AM] Polk#1596
but i mean


[29-Feb-20 10:45 AM] Polk#1596
if the people asking questions get a fast response


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] Polk#1596
i dont see why it is a problem


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
warning them would just slow down the responses


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ngl


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] bman#0435
polk i never said it had to do with the speed


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] bman#0435
it has to do with him answering nearly every single question


[29-Feb-20 10:46 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t see a issue cause like no other managers complain about it


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] Polk#1596
bman


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
And kenzi just answered some questions too


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] bman#0435
it just annoys me because he should be answering every question and should give more managers a chance to andwer them


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] Polk#1596
as long as they get a quick response it doesnt really matter who it is


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
If it was him like constantly hog reports


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] Polk#1596
we cant keep punishing our MRs for being active


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
Then maybe


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
But questions I don’t see issue


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You forgot Emily and Anna exist


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] Polk#1596
although if u want to tell him to take a little break then sure


[29-Feb-20 10:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] Polk#1596
just dont warn him


[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] bman#0435
since when is answering questions considered being active


[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] Polk#1596
..


[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] Polk#1596
if he is being dedicated to answer questions then that is just good


[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's active overall lol


[29-Feb-20 10:48 AM] Polk#1596
i never answered questions because i could not be bothered


[29-Feb-20 10:49 AM] Polk#1596
so he is doing a good job in my opinion


[29-Feb-20 10:49 AM] stacey#1000
If a bunch of other managers complain about never getting to answer questions then I see no issue in warning him but like no one is so


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Polk#1596
u guys are being too strict when it comes to warning


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Polk#1596
if people start complaining about lyoo


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Polk#1596
tell him to calm down


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Polk#1596
then if he continues


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Polk#1596
warn him


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Polk#1596
like he wouldnt know he is doing something wrong


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] bman#0435
i said to verbally tell him


[29-Feb-20 10:50 AM] bman#0435
not make it written


[29-Feb-20 10:51 AM] Polk#1596
well stacey said "warning him" so im not sure whether she meant verbal or written


[29-Feb-20 10:51 AM] Polk#1596
but just do a friendly reminder first


[29-Feb-20 10:51 AM] Polk#1596
then go from there

[29-Feb-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
and i ran up to him and asked him to turn on his username


[29-Feb-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
thinking he was some impersonator


[29-Feb-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
but then he was like "How about you"


[29-Feb-20 12:21 PM] Polk#1596
cuz i forgot to turn my name on


[29-Feb-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596
AND THAT WAS AWKWARD


[29-Feb-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Feb-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596

EmmaPendragonToday at 1:28 PM
so if you didn't break a rule
why did you go "ummmmmm" when i asked if you broke a rule lol
markkToday at 1:28 PM
because i did say stuff like
straw removed me from the board and i said jacob when i was promoting u people on the hr boards said no so like i didn’t know if that’s what u were referring 2
the thing ab the hr boards was obvs a joke tho


[29-Feb-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
no ownership of his actions at all wow


[29-Feb-20 01:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lmao were you expecting better


[29-Feb-20 01:30 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey instead of banning him i'd take his talkative role and not allow him to speak in VCs lol that way he can watch from afar


[29-Feb-20 01:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
former and talkative*


[29-Feb-20 01:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[29-Feb-20 04:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
sure


[29-Feb-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[29-Feb-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525
"Using Roblox as a platform for sexual or intimate roleplaying is not only dangerous, but in many cases illegal."


[29-Feb-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525
something like that


[29-Feb-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525
but better


[29-Feb-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I see it as Kat stopping the relationship


[29-Feb-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And Lucas developed feelings again apparently??


[29-Feb-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm getting Zippy vibes from the situation


[29-Feb-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But way worse


[29-Feb-20 04:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
i mean, im not complaining at lucas resigning, saved us a worthless investigation for him to resign right before he's fired/suspended!


[29-Feb-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
lucas defo didnt act alone, but like


[29-Feb-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
hes a manager


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and we've talked about ODing so much


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and how its dangerous


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and these bitches STILL DO IT


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and then he has the audacity to say "i want to make you wet" or whatever on BLOXTON??


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
kk im not done here but heres what i got so bar and added in what emma said


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
the other stuff was concerning, but the thing that annoyed me the most was how he had the audacity to send a highly inappropriate PM on bloxton grounds


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
at least he didnt deny it when I dmed him


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
and thats a complete violation of our OD rule, private server or not anyway


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
i gotta reword the start of it but heres a general idea


[29-Feb-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
Greetings MRs,

This announcement is to inform you all about the recent resignation of xLucas. Yes, Lucas resigned, but he was about to be fired for his actions of acting extremely inappropriate to other users online.  
I would like to remind you all to be very careful of who you trust online and that your actions reflect on your role her at Bloxton.  
Using ROBLOX as a platform for sexual or intimate roleplaying is not only extremely dangerous, but it may also be illegal in some cases. We want all of you to be safe and to really think of your actions before doing something.

Greetings MRs,

This announcement is to inform you all about the recent resignation of xLucas. Yes, Lucas resigned, but he was about to be fired for his actions of acting extremely inappropriate to other users online.  
   I would like to remind you all to be very careful of who you trust online and that your actions reflect on your role her at Bloxton.  
   Using ROBLOX as a platform for sexual or intimate roleplaying is not only extremely dangerous, but it may also be illegal in some cases. We want all of you to be safe and to really think of your actions before doing something.    
    Please keep in mind sharing this information with other members outside the MR team or confronting Lucas about this can and will result in major consequences. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this, please feel free to contact any member of the HR team.

Sincerely,
Staceyzn
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels

Greetings MRs,

This announcement is to inform you all about the recent resignation of xLucas. Yes, Lucas resigned, but he was about to be fired for his actions of acting extremely inappropriate to other users online.  
   I would like to remind you all to be very careful of who you trust online and that your actions reflect on your role her at Bloxton.  
   Using ROBLOX as a platform for sexual or intimate roleplaying is not only extremely dangerous, but it may also be illegal in some cases. We want all of you to be safe and to really think of your actions before doing something.    
    Please keep in mind sharing this information with other members outside the MR team or confronting Lucas about this can and will result in major consequences. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this, please feel free to contact any member of the HR team.

my top secret plan: trade my valk to emma for a small limited and report her for scamming. emma gets banned and terminated from roblox platforms, which means she is forced to resign. we wont give her her rank back because scamming is something that is major. that is how to get rid of emma

[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
can we


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
let


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
beanman im in bburg


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
employees take breaks


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
at the hotel


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn how many people did lucas OD in this group


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
i knew kathy


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
why not


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
but why is exotic in there


[29-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then they will try to get rooms


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok and


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and take up guest spaces like


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the bar


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats what breaks are for


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so i think


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if we let them have breaks


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we gotta put rules


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe if we have enough staff they should be allowed


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no crowding the bar


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and no rooms


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; apparently these people are either victims or witnesses


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525
honestly


[29-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think breaks would be better if we had a break room again


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
but a few of the MRs (I think Madi and Exotic) are only there cause they tried investigating..


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
i know we've always said we "cant" punish people for ODing


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
which is a bit annoying


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank allow staff to have breaks?

1️⃣ yes
2️⃣ with certain conditions. E.G Has to be at least x number of receps, x number of security
3️⃣ no

{Reactions}
1️⃣ 2️⃣ (7) 3️⃣ 

[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
but ive dealt with too many of these things


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause like HRs are here for a reason


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
that im honestly wanting to make it a rule that if you online date you get suspended


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
or fired


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
its so toxic and almost always leads to us getting involved


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
and if they're truly wanting to "date" then they should know how to keep it a secret


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
lucas and this BS was clearly an attention stunt, thus why it got so bad


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i also think that a rule should be that


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u cant work at the bar


[29-Feb-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525
meanwhile like alex and cola, they keep it private so like idc doesnt bother me


[29-Feb-20 05:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc some ppl might consider working somewhere different as a break @bonnie591


[29-Feb-20 05:36 PM] emma;#1525
but most people ODing do it for attention


[29-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok


[29-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
so


[29-Feb-20 05:38 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey are you kidding me, these people tried to report to you and you ignored it lol


[29-Feb-20 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591

@xM_inn what..


[29-Feb-20 05:57 PM] Polk#1596
Ok, so that went very bad for me @bonnie591 @xM_inn


[29-Feb-20 05:57 PM] Polk#1596
first we were doing physical training


[29-Feb-20 05:57 PM] Polk#1596
and i misunderstood


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
i thought we were supposed to do 5 jumping jacks when we crossed the line


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
like the starting line


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
BUT


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
they meant the like


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
track line


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
the ones ur running in the middle of


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
so basically i accidentally crossed the line


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
got asked to do 10 jumping jacks


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
and i did


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
/e cheer


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
ONE


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
and did 10


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
then they went


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
"no, dont use emotes"


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
then i did it again while jumping


[29-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
AND WHEN I GOT BACK INTO IT


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
and like was about to start lap 5/5, everyone else was done


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
because i just misunderstood a little


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
lol haha


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
shut up bonnie


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
then


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
on the shooting range


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
FREAKING GRASS


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
WAS BLOCKING MY VIEW


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
LIKE FR


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
IT WAS BLOCKING THE BOTTOM PART OF THE DOLL


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
and nutty was like


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
"what happened? you shot at the ground"


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
well no kidding theres literally grass covering it


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
then i got to switch places and i did it


[29-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
and i passed that


[29-Feb-20 06:00 PM] Polk#1596
and in situations it went ok


[29-Feb-20 06:00 PM] Polk#1596
but since i was the worst in phsyical training


[29-Feb-20 06:00 PM] Polk#1596
i doubt i will pass


[29-Feb-20 06:00 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Feb-20 08:43 PM] bman#0435
ya we did


[29-Feb-20 08:44 PM] bman#0435
think just a nice reminder to change it


[29-Feb-20 08:51 PM] emma;#1525
well one of the MRs in questions told someone they could have swearing, they just cant direct people towards it


[29-Feb-20 08:51 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think we made someone change for swearing


[29-Feb-20 08:51 PM] emma;#1525
i think we made them change bc it was inapprorpaite


[29-Feb-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
that was for lrs


[29-Feb-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
we made an announcement for mrs status' tho


[29-Feb-20 08:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
i cant rlly remember tbh


[29-Feb-20 08:53 PM] emma;#1525

[29-Feb-20 08:55 PM] bman#0435

[29-Feb-20 08:56 PM] xM_inn#2821

[29-Feb-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435

[29-Feb-20 09:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The girl I pussied out in lol


[29-Feb-20 09:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So basically


[29-Feb-20 09:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Straw said he wasn’t in it anymore and this guy said he was and sent a picture


[29-Feb-20 09:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So like I thought this was gonna be an easy thing but now idk if straws lying or not


[29-Feb-20 09:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait what is happening


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So do u think we should open an investigation bc straw is a former hr and zae is a former MR


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or just look into it without an investigation card


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Read up trey


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I need to know what the fuck is happening lol


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Straw pictures r up there


[29-Feb-20 09:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O ya also straw had no problem telling me what I asked for and didn’t want to tell bman anything which is kinda weird


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And he went to bman


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Right beanman


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
so nice to know straw lied to me 😌


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Straws being sus


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
If he’s still in the group chat he lied to me 2 bc he told me he wasn’t


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So he could have been sending stuff too


[29-Feb-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And the run guy said multiple people were doing it soooo


[29-Feb-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Perhaps ask him why he lied


[29-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I gotta wait till tomorrow Bc I’m not on my pc rn


[29-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I wanna have all the pictures in one place


[29-Feb-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Also have less time rn


[29-Feb-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so let me get this straight


[29-Feb-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Strxw was acting different towards Bman


[29-Feb-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But with you he told info


[29-Feb-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And from there


[29-Feb-20 09:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Wtf


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
9 pings


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
An LR revealed that he was lying about not being in the group chat


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] bman#0435
he lied to me and called me out for telling him i couldnt do anything abt it but is understanding towards cookie, gives more info to her, and the lr exposes him


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like he just told me everything I was asking for


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And didn’t want to tell bman anything


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait a minute


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is it because Zae sent porn??


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And then the Lr basically said the opposite of what straw said


[29-Feb-20 10:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Nononono


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Is straw basically said only zae sent a graphic image


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] a. ღ#4222
zae did what..


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And he said it was 1 image


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And then this LR said


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
It was multiple people


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Sending multiple things


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And then straw said he left and the Lr said he didn’t


[29-Feb-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So basically straws lying


[29-Feb-20 10:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Who's basically going to confront him


[29-Feb-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I can do it in the morning unless someone else wants to


[29-Feb-20 10:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also um


[29-Feb-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Btw the Lr wants to be anonymous so


[29-Feb-20 10:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oak leaked apparently??


[29-Feb-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[29-Feb-20 10:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
