@xM_inn is dais_ies supposed to be allowed in the discord server


[01-Nov-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
I think she appealed


[01-Nov-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
I guess just monitor her behaviour closely over the next few weeks


[01-Nov-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
She's very lucky to get an appeal though


[01-Nov-20 12:47 PM] katie#0200

they swabbed a bowling ball and it had like doo doo residue in the bowling ball finger holes

either way, there's gonna be violence.


[01-Nov-20 09:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[01-Nov-20 09:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yes.


[01-Nov-20 09:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

He won and i got excited


[01-Nov-20 09:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and I didn't have to worry about stepping outside and possibly being harmed.


[01-Nov-20 09:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
now I'm worried about being harmed after this election.


[01-Nov-20 09:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Anyone wanna do a appeal reading session tomorrow?


[01-Nov-20 09:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Sure, remind me. hopefully I’m not busy when u do but if I am I’ll let u know. :Blinkz:


[01-Nov-20 09:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I probably won't be available myself, but usually I'm here on Mondays.


[01-Nov-20 09:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I shouldn't have anywhere to go tomorrow.


[01-Nov-20 09:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what are the odds, I open Tik Tok and it’s a video of business being locked up @KjRBLX 💀


[01-Nov-20 09:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[01-Nov-20 09:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[01-Nov-20 09:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It's crazy. I understand if someone gets mad because they want whats better for their country, but today people just be doing irrational stuff just because they lost.


[01-Nov-20 09:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like some people get cheated on and their first idea is to go shoot them.

How come we don’t let seniors read tickets?


[02-Nov-20 09:32 AM] ethan;#0003
It would solve the problem of them being backed up


[02-Nov-20 09:33 AM] ethan;#0003
We keep bringing up ideas on how to solve it, but we haven’t done any of the ideas


[02-Nov-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000
@ethan; yknow seniors can do tickets right. With ticket sessions they can do talkative role request


[02-Nov-20 09:36 AM] ethan;#0003
Yes but I’m talking about without sessions


[02-Nov-20 09:36 AM] ethan;#0003
Because there are not enough ticket sessions


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] stacey#1000
We mentioned before we already put a lot on the seniors and shouldn’t make them do tickets on top of it


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] stacey#1000
Top*


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] ethan;#0003
Tickets would be optional


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] ethan;#0003
Because some would still do it


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] courtney#5125
that, and we can't really give them server administrator to give ppl roles..


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] ethan;#0003
They don’t get admin


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] stacey#1000
I still don’t think we should allow them to do it


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] ethan;#0003
Ok


[02-Nov-20 09:37 AM] courtney#5125
so how would they give ppl talkative role


[02-Nov-20 09:38 AM] stacey#1000
We never had a really huge issue with tickets


[02-Nov-20 09:38 AM] ethan;#0003
The ticket role


[02-Nov-20 09:38 AM] stacey#1000
I hosted a ticket session a week ago to get help with talkative roles


[02-Nov-20 09:38 AM] courtney#5125
tickets dont overflow that often, and the few times that they do, then a ticket session with seniors can be held

we cant just push our duties off onto seniors, they have plenty to do


[02-Nov-20 09:39 AM] ethan;#0003
People are leaving because there tickets aren’t being read fast enough


[02-Nov-20 09:39 AM] courtney#5125
then we need to process tickets more often, not just make seniors do the duties the hr team is meant to do


[02-Nov-20 09:40 AM] stacey#1000
Even if seniors read tickets they can’t give roles and an hr would have to give them roles to get access to the server so it won’t really make it faster


[02-Nov-20 09:40 AM] ethan;#0003
True


[02-Nov-20 09:40 AM] stacey#1000
If you ever notice tickets overflowing you can always post in HR announcements to get help with it


[02-Nov-20 09:40 AM] courtney#5125
they dont overflow often and theyre pretty easy to get through, seniors dont have the permissions to give roles and they dont have access to all of the information needed if someone has a question


[02-Nov-20 09:41 AM] impact#0297
We are clearing them out today and then closing them till Nov 4th


[02-Nov-20 09:41 AM] impact#0297
I'll ping you all around lunch to clear up over some food and maybe VC?

[02-Nov-20 10:00 AM] impact#0297
@stacey do I just give the seniors the "reviewer" role to get them to help?


[02-Nov-20 10:01 AM] impact#0297
Or support team?


[02-Nov-20 10:01 AM] impact#0297

@stacey I can do that 😌 just give me the word

Pretty sure my teachers are voting trump :rolleyes: but i expected that since it is Mississippi


[02-Nov-20 12:25 PM] ethan;#0003
New York, most people don’t like trump


[02-Nov-20 12:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I have a friend who’s in new york, i asked him who he would vote for, and he said trump


[02-Nov-20 12:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I expected that anyway because in the past he tried to defends trump word


[02-Nov-20 12:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oop


[02-Nov-20 12:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Cali is a blue state so I think it’s safe to say that people here hate Trump


[02-Nov-20 12:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank remember to transcript tickets before closing. also when doing waning appeals only appeal the warnings that are 30+ days old and only the ones that they actually appealed.


[02-Nov-20 12:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
@impact ^ (u review tickets too sometimes so read that too, idk if you have today though)


[02-Nov-20 12:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So its not, the most recent warning has to be 30+ days, for them to appeal any?


[02-Nov-20 12:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@bonnie591


[02-Nov-20 12:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can appeal any warnings that is over 30+ days but their chances should decrease if theres a warning in the past 30 days


[02-Nov-20 12:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
so for example flyros, only 5 out of the 7 warnings were appealable


[02-Nov-20 12:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What does his warnings even look like?


[02-Nov-20 12:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
reasons?


[02-Nov-20 12:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
two were from February for rule 7


[02-Nov-20 12:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
one for advertising


[02-Nov-20 12:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
two for rule 4 i think


[02-Nov-20 12:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
idk the others


[02-Nov-20 12:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Wait


[02-Nov-20 12:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
What does transcript do


[02-Nov-20 12:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
I clicked it on one of the tickets but it never did anything so I just thought it didnt work


[02-Nov-20 12:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Just saves a log of the channel in ticket logs


[02-Nov-20 12:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like a transcript of the ticket with the messages and stuff


[02-Nov-20 12:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Gives u a downloadable file aka the transcript of the channel


[02-Nov-20 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ohh i thought it DMed you the transcript


[02-Nov-20 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
But I never got a DM


[02-Nov-20 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
so I assumed it didnt work


[02-Nov-20 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
Oh well I'll do that from now on!


[02-Nov-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
I usually just do talkative role request


[02-Nov-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
but yes ill keep that in mind'


[02-Nov-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
to look at that as well


[02-Nov-20 12:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@bonnie591 do i want us to save a transcript, if the user didnt say anything, and left the server?


[02-Nov-20 12:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah please id like everything transcript just in case we need to look back for some reason


[02-Nov-20 01:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright just checking


[02-Nov-20 01:16 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact that ticket with renster_hd, don’t give him the former role the way he is talking I would take away his talkative and make him wait to reapply for it


[02-Nov-20 01:17 PM] ethan;#0003
Make him wait till tickets reopen


[02-Nov-20 01:17 PM] ethan;#0003
To reapply for it


[02-Nov-20 01:17 PM] ethan;#0003
Wait I misread what he said


[02-Nov-20 01:18 PM] ethan;#0003
Still kinda a dick thing to say


[02-Nov-20 01:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I remember when i went to the hotel once and i was dealing with an employee, the employee got suspended and i like server ban the employee so they would come back and abuse, and then renster came up saying i aa or i was racist...just being in something he had no business being in


[02-Nov-20 01:28 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@ethan; I agree

Renster is one of those people who thinks he is the center of attention and everyone is on his side and thinks he is funny


[02-Nov-20 01:28 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Honestly his behavior is just


[02-Nov-20 01:28 PM] Tattoblue#5828
unacceptable

I mean, it isn't appropriate to send in a public chat.

@impact are you ok with me changing your office key colour back to default as people who have it and don't have any other coloured role gets their name in red which isn't really fair and makes them look like they have a significant role color


[03-Nov-20 09:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
The chairman and vice are the roles with red as well


[03-Nov-20 09:51 AM] impact#0297
I can change it off red if you want


[03-Nov-20 09:52 AM] impact#0297
Just did.


[03-Nov-20 10:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
Alr I just changed it from black to default as the same problem would occur if it's not on default.


[03-Nov-20 10:17 AM] impact#0297
@bonnie591 did anyone actually complain?


[03-Nov-20 10:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
Ethan has mentioned it here a few times and I believe some people in the server doesn't like it according to him


[03-Nov-20 10:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
I personally agree with Ethan


[03-Nov-20 10:19 AM] impact#0297
The question was if anyone complained.


[03-Nov-20 10:20 AM] bonnie591#0591
Technically yes but not directly to me

@High Rank New shift will be hired today!!


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] impact#0297
@bonnie591 can we position that later into the night


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] impact#0297
in case chat goes out of control we can announce a shift and basically distract everyone


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney get ready to do your job of yelling at your sister to go on pc later. I’ll tell you when tho


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
I get to announce it right?


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] impact#0297
just a nice tool we could have if necessary


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
I can't really stay up too long so I'd rather get it done. It will happen in around 2-3 hours


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] impact#0297
Make it 3 hours.


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
If it gets too bad just close gd


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
We'll see


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] impact#0297
We aren't closing GD lmao


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
It will take around 30 mins to an hour for me to go over stuff with her


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] impact#0297
Remember how that ended last time


[03-Nov-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
And I’m not announcing until after we are done going over riles


[03-Nov-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
Rules*


[03-Nov-20 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
If it gets that bad then we may have to


[03-Nov-20 02:45 PM] impact#0297
I have a better idea.


[03-Nov-20 02:45 PM] impact#0297
Remove the ability to add attachments to everyone, and slow mode it up.


[03-Nov-20 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea that could work


[03-Nov-20 02:45 PM] impact#0297
I don't think we should close anything.


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Save closing to if we really need to, e.g the chat is literally hell and every message is fights about it or something


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Slowmode if it gets bad


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn’t  close it at all


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] impact#0297
Slowmode it to hell


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] impact#0297
Like 2 hours or some shit


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
6 hour slowmode


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
😎


[03-Nov-20 02:46 PM] impact#0297
Don't bother closing


[03-Nov-20 02:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
Anyway the shift promotion will change the mood anyway, we'll probably do it in around 2-3 hours so yeah


[03-Nov-20 02:47 PM] impact#0297
Take all the fucking time you need, seriously.


[03-Nov-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Nov-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000

@stacey Make sure to review the color pallet of the uniforms, and the significance to how the color is correlated with the logo and hotel.

[03-Nov-20 05:11 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Are those projections or did Indiana close down their voting already @impact


[03-Nov-20 05:11 PM] impact#0297
Most states are counting mail-in ballots are reporting them the moment the polls close..

[03-Nov-20 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003
and when people are fooling around and being unprofessional


[03-Nov-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821

[03-Nov-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821

[03-Nov-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
and then guess what


[03-Nov-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
people lose interest


[03-Nov-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821

[03-Nov-20 08:15 PM] courtney#5125
the lrs aren't complaining.... they like bloo's silliness at sessions. so idk why moody has a problem with it when no one else does, it's not like moody's directly impacted by it anyways


[03-Nov-20 08:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Nov-20 08:16 PM] courtney#5125
if he wants to work at a dry group with zero fun, by all means, he is welcome to!


[03-Nov-20 08:16 PM] xM_inn#2821

[03-Nov-20 08:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
glad we now know


[03-Nov-20 08:17 PM] courtney#5125

[03-Nov-20 08:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
mhm


[03-Nov-20 08:18 PM] lyss#0709
nobody else complains that bloo literally dies and comes back to life 452 times so why is moody so upset


[03-Nov-20 08:19 PM] courtney#5125
HAHA right


[03-Nov-20 08:19 PM] Fraux#7971
nobody complained when bloo was in his wheel chair.......


[03-Nov-20 08:20 PM] lyss#0709
like thats why we have over a million members and other groups with extremely strict staff members dont even have half of that


[03-Nov-20 08:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
our group member count speaks for itself


[03-Nov-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
well, moody wont get HR with that trash talking


[03-Nov-20 08:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
if us making things fun and enjoyable was bad


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
we'd notice by the member count


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
who did he dm that to?


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
and how many people engage


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Maddie (dais_ies)


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
He's good friends with her


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
lol he trash talks mayas promo


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
and yet they are completely different timezones


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
just cause he doesnt see her doesnt mean she is not active


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
lolz seems like he's just finding a reason to complain about things


[03-Nov-20 08:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
i wouldnt take it personally, he must just BE moody


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
but its ok cuz he isnt going to be moving from senior anytime soon


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] stacey#1000
he was already terminated once as an MR


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
YEAH I SAID THAT


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
HES LUCKY TO EVEN BE SENIOR


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] stacey#1000
exactly


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
especially considering the reasoning for his original termination


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] stacey#1000
he should be lucky we unblacklisted him


[03-Nov-20 08:22 PM] stacey#1000
and promoted him again

Could we get to the bottom of this? I can't find anything in the logs.


[04-Nov-20 03:18 AM] babymariobebe#7563
No idea who did that but honestly if they're cursing in a discord server where its not allowed a warning isn't too far-fetched 🤷‍♂️ @impact


[04-Nov-20 03:18 AM] babymariobebe#7563
And while you're at it please do change your name, for the same reason described above


[04-Nov-20 03:19 AM] babymariobebe#7563
regardless if its just this server its not really necessary

[04-Nov-20 04:10 AM] Beartikal#9760
@impact based on your wording it sounds like you are confused over what the image is showing. she wasn't warned and cursed at necessarily but it looks like the warning is repeating what she said in the discord?
so for example, she said the f word so they warned her for saying that? am i wrong?

[04-Nov-20 03:33 PM] xM_inn#2821

[04-Nov-20 03:33 PM] stacey#1000
Also I ain’t the one sending her the inactive letter


[04-Nov-20 03:33 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Nov-20 03:33 PM] xM_inn#2821

[04-Nov-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000

Just gonna check a few things and make sure we're valid !


[04-Nov-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
And she’s legit on firestone rn. She ain’t inactive


[04-Nov-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
If you want proof of her being active making the notice invalid ask tatto


[04-Nov-20 03:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
> Wait did her notice go overdue
@stacey  yeah it did, i tagged her about it on her card asking for an update but nothing has happend so far


[04-Nov-20 03:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
that was 2 dayz ago and her inactivity notice ended on the 1st


[04-Nov-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah so she ain’t even looking at the board


[04-Nov-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
And I ain’t giving her reminders no more


[04-Nov-20 03:42 PM] impact#0297
@bonnie591 idk man about the talkative roles..

[04-Nov-20 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
If you feel like it's needed u can delete the access pending one again, but the unverified will still be able to make one via rules and info


[04-Nov-20 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
I've closed my dms for the next month, you may dm me still as you're on my friend list


[04-Nov-20 03:45 PM] impact#0297

Senior's can't get a hold of you


[04-Nov-20 03:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm about to go on inactive notice soon and I don't want constant dms disturbing me while I revise. If any mr+ wishes to dm me then they can feel free to send a friend request as I have now opened them


[04-Nov-20 03:48 PM] bonnie591#0591

I don't mind her taking time to become post certified but among us and a ridealong is when I do mind


[04-Nov-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Nov-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Nov-20 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
O


[04-Nov-20 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
So I think in the letter you should mention how she’s been seen on other games during her inactive notice


[04-Nov-20 04:38 PM] ethan;#0003
Greetings **meganzn**,

I'm messaging you in regards to your current position at Bloxton Hotels. At this moment in time, you're employed as **12 | Senior Management**. Over the past few months, the High-Rank Team has been monitoring your activity at Bloxton and we have determined that your current activity doesn't meet our standards. If you fail to respond within one week of this letter being sent, then you'll be demoted back to your previous LR position which is **5 | Bartender**. Upon your response, we would also appreciate a valid reason for your inactivity to be provided too.

Regards,

**e6thn**
**Shift Manager**
Bloxton Hotels


[04-Nov-20 04:38 PM] ethan;#0003

[04-Nov-20 04:38 PM] stacey#1000

We could say demo to management instead of lr but up to you


[04-Nov-20 04:40 PM] ethan;#0003
Greetings **meganzn**,

I'm messaging you in regards to your current position at Bloxton Hotels. At this moment in time, you're employed as **12 | Senior Management**. Over the past few months, the High-Rank Team has been monitoring your activity at Bloxton and we have determined that your current activity doesn't meet our standards. If you fail to respond within two weeks of this letter being sent, then you'll be demoted back to your previous LR position which is **LR RANK**. Upon your response, we would also appreciate a valid reason for your inactivity to be provided too.

Regards,

**e6thn**
**Shift Manager**

[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] ethan;#0003
but 1 week seemed too short


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I thought it was 14 days


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] ethan;#0003
so i asked


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
it was changed to a week


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
2 weeks is too long


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
That’s how long we gave other people


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
and they take foreverrr


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] ethan;#0003
she is typing


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
I’m ready for her to make up an excuse for being inactive


[04-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
And then we got the proof of her being on other games


[04-Nov-20 04:45 PM] ethan;#0003
istg if she says she is busy with scool


[04-Nov-20 04:45 PM] ethan;#0003
school


[04-Nov-20 04:45 PM] ethan;#0003
or her computer is broken


[04-Nov-20 04:45 PM] ethan;#0003
or some bs thing


[04-Nov-20 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
She’s probably going to say she’s really busy with school, marching band, and drama club stuff like stage crew


[04-Nov-20 04:46 PM] xM_inn#2821

megan_mustacheToday at 5:46 PM
Greetings Ethanx and the rest of the HR team, I understand my activity has been more than horrid lately. I've just been super stressed with school and the last thing I'm trying to do is split myself multiple different ways and get even more stressed. I currently am not doing so well in school so that's obviously my first priority. If you've seen me on ROBLOX chances are I'm trying to take a break and de-stress myself. I can try my hardest to improve my activity however, I can't promise a full checklist every week. Hopefully you guys understand that as it's been crazy this year but if you have any questions at all, just let me know! Have a great day.


[04-Nov-20 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I’ll spam you sounds good


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn @stacey


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] ethan;#0003
she reposnded


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] ethan;#0003
responded


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so she admits she was on roblox but like


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] ethan;#0003
I am going to mention how she has been seen on among us for up to 3-5 hours at a time.


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
Does she really have to be on among us for 5 hours and not even try to do 1-2 sessions a week?


[04-Nov-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
fair but not fair hmmm


[04-Nov-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I get she wants to do other games to get her mind off other stuff


[04-Nov-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
But that’s not really an excuse to not even try to do 1 session


[04-Nov-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
Everyone has busy lives


[04-Nov-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
She’s not the only one


[04-Nov-20 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
She plays among us for hours a day, every day


[04-Nov-20 04:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'd say give her the following options;

1. Go on notice but if caught on ROBLOX the notice will be void.

2. Start being more active and getting at least 75% of your checklist, work for 100% though.


[04-Nov-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
She should at least try to get 50% every week


[04-Nov-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
If she has time to do that stuff she has time to spend 10 minutes do applications


[04-Nov-20 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn can i say cought online playing games for an extended period of time


[04-Nov-20 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003
instreead of roblox


[04-Nov-20 04:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
5 hours playing among us? 💀


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Among us isn’t that fun to play for 5 hours tbh


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
She is not usually on among us that long but she was on it for 5 hours one evening


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It’s only fun for like 3 rounds then I get bored


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah ikr


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
Same


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
I get so bored of it


[04-Nov-20 04:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I think it’s starting to die a bit. It was really popular in like September and October kinda


[04-Nov-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah it won’t last forever it’s really repetitive


[04-Nov-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
Repetitive games usually never last


[04-Nov-20 04:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Although with their new update where you can talk in game, that might boost it again cause people like to yell at other people in game just by chat 😂


[04-Nov-20 04:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so imagine if they add that feature


[04-Nov-20 04:54 PM] ethan;#0003
1) You go on inactive notice again; all times you are seen online will be noted. Seen online playing games for an extended period of time, will result in the notice being void.

2) You complete your checklist up to at least 75% or more.


[04-Nov-20 04:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan; yessir


[04-Nov-20 04:54 PM] Fraux#7971

and then she cant wait .005 seconds for me to name her

@ethan; sebby's dming me asking me why you banned him from the interview center


[05-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
the only reason he was there was to attempt to get staff so he can verify on multiple alt accounts on the discord


[05-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
he did that yesterday


[05-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
last night he had like 4 discord accounts verified under 1 roblox account


[05-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003

so im reading chat logs in the discord and seems like earlier swan and trey and flyro where joking around calling each other cbs and then memelord somehow got involved and he seems to be serious when he sees this (from what he says after) asking what cb that they think he is


[05-Nov-20 09:03 PM] ethan;#0003
idk but this sounds to me like a cb

I’m hoping it does


[05-Nov-20 09:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But they still have to count military ballots, so if Biden is able to get a good enough lead then he shouldn’t have to worry about it flipping back


[05-Nov-20 10:02 PM] ethan;#0003
he might of already


[05-Nov-20 10:02 PM] ethan;#0003
it might just be the website not updating

@Bloo_Berriez military ballots?


[05-Nov-20 10:08 PM] Fraux#7971

@xM_inn On the forms, you should tell them to put their discord userid too

So if their tag changes and so I can just do a reverse lookup either by just using <@TAGHERE> or using this website

@KjRBLX meme got suspended yesterday, unless he copied one of the staff announcements prior to his suspension but


[06-Nov-20 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
It’s probably meme


[06-Nov-20 03:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828
he's the one that recently got promoted so yeah probably ihm


[06-Nov-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
He’s probably leaking it mad he got suspended


[06-Nov-20 03:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Question, does anyone else tell the person they're promoting to make sure to read previous announcements?


[06-Nov-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
I do


[06-Nov-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
I think


[06-Nov-20 03:27 PM] ethan;#0003
he is suspended


[06-Nov-20 03:27 PM] ethan;#0003
last night


[06-Nov-20 03:27 PM] ethan;#0003
for investigation


[06-Nov-20 03:27 PM] ethan;#0003
minn gave me permission


[06-Nov-20 03:31 PM] stacey#1000
So he could’ve very much got that announcement before he was suspended


[06-Nov-20 03:35 PM] courtney#5125
right after I got the report of it he conveniently asked more abt his suspension :shrug:

What the National Debt Means to You
The U.S. debt seems to grow every year. But how does national debt actually affect you?

[07-Nov-20 02:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
in general or because of biden


[07-Nov-20 02:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
hmm the article is kinda vague


[07-Nov-20 02:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
any examples


[07-Nov-20 02:33 AM] impact#0297
lower standard of living, reduced government services, ability to get a mortgage is diminished, businesses will leave country if there is instability in currency and paying back debt


[07-Nov-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
now im wondering how that will look like


[07-Nov-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760

[07-Nov-20 05:21 PM] courtney#5125
bensons wondering if he can make a cb list to be posted to managers. i believe it was removed bc there were just too many cbs but i was wondering if yall wanted him to make one or not?


[07-Nov-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
No because that just encouraged more people to become CBs


[07-Nov-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
thats the whole reason it was removed


[07-Nov-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
it will just get leaked to CBs


[07-Nov-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
and there is no point for it


[07-Nov-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
managers can make their own but we should not share it with other managers


[07-Nov-20 05:23 PM] courtney#5125
thats what i figured!

all he does is think hes friends with every mr and hr and then complains when they block him after he's rude to them

im glad i stopped talking to cole when i did bc hes clearly just gotten worse

i would think u would notice ur losing a friends and start trying to change your attitude


[07-Nov-20 09:30 PM] lyss#0709
i think he's much too full of himself to do that unfortunately

yes i think it'd be better for managers to dm each other instead of pointing it out in front of everyone. some of my close friends who are managers have also talked about how they feel like theyre being called out for minor mistakes and it's embarrassing for them


[08-Nov-20 04:36 PM] Fraux#7971
uh i don’t find that aggressive per se... but im not opposed to people dming for that reason, i personally find it impolite to call someone out like that in front of all those people


[08-Nov-20 04:36 PM] Fraux#7971
and yeah it is embarassinglike lysis said


[08-Nov-20 04:36 PM] Fraux#7971

lyss


[08-Nov-20 04:37 PM] lyss#0709
even if they're being nice about it, id still be embarrassed


[08-Nov-20 04:37 PM] Fraux#7971
me too , i usually would dm the people as opposed to doing it publicly


[08-Nov-20 04:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I don't find it aggressive also i'm not opposed to the dming but I wouldn't be embarrassed.


[08-Nov-20 04:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It's kinda like when your teacher reads your essay outloud but in ur head u just remember we all make mistakes


[08-Nov-20 04:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh i did say aggressive IGNORE THAT I DIDNT MEAN AGGRESSIVE


[08-Nov-20 04:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but i do understand how some people could be embarrassed


[08-Nov-20 04:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Only time when I had to call someone out in management lounge is when the manager had their dms closed.


[08-Nov-20 04:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but i didnt do it rudely


[08-Nov-20 04:41 PM] Tattoblue#5828
anywayz ill start typing up an announcement and send it here


[08-Nov-20 04:49 PM] courtney#5125
i agree with an announcement. ive had so many managers come to me in the past saying that they wish other managers would just privately dm them. its not necessary to call out a simple mistake in front of every single other manager. itd go a lot smoother if people would just dm the person they want to talk to instead of pinging them in front of everyone

:bloxton3: Mistakes :bloxton3: 

Greetings, Managers and Seniors. 

Recently we've noticed that you guys have been tagging people in the management lounge telling them when they've made a mistake, and while it's fine to tell them that they've made a mistake, in the future please DM them about it if possible. If their DMs are closed, then you may tag them in the management lounge. The reason we're making this change is so that more people will be comfortable, it can be quite embarrassing to get tagged in front of everyone about a minor mistake that you may have made. 

Best regards,
Tattoblue

They somehow just got into that topic


[08-Nov-20 09:02 PM] stacey#1000

[10-Nov-20 05:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
apparently some devs got to talk to Lil Nas X on zoom thats CRAZY


[10-Nov-20 05:16 PM] ethan;#0003
they did something with another music artist


[10-Nov-20 05:16 PM] ethan;#0003
like a month ago


[10-Nov-20 05:16 PM] ethan;#0003
it was AWFULLLLLLLLLLLL


[10-Nov-20 05:16 PM] ethan;#0003
it was all pre recorded


[10-Nov-20 05:16 PM] ethan;#0003
the editing of the video was AWFUL


[10-Nov-20 05:16 PM] Fraux#7971
@ethan; what if u promote them before checking inventory


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] ethan;#0003
you dont tell them any rules or stuff until u check


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] ethan;#0003
becuase if they arent a CB or alt


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] ethan;#0003
why would they refuse to open it


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
this should be much better


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
they have improved the video quality


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
I like that idea


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
and its made by some pretty solid devs


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
although apparently in the back-end the process is a disaster


[10-Nov-20 05:17 PM] ethan;#0003
the video was good quality, just the production quality


[10-Nov-20 05:18 PM] Fraux#7971
so if it’s a surprise promo like u randomly announce at training u just tell em to open inventory before rules


[10-Nov-20 05:18 PM] ethan;#0003
the person who was in the video showed they didnt want to do this


[10-Nov-20 05:18 PM] Fraux#7971
just doible checking bc i rly do like that rule!!


[10-Nov-20 05:18 PM] ethan;#0003

:CheckMark: || **KICKING USERS**

Greetings, @MR Team!

The HR team would like to remind you all that, when using kicking, naming, respawning, or using ANY command on someone at the hotel, training, or interviews, you need to include **at least 4 letters of their username**. While there was an announcement on this a while back, we've had numerous new MRs since then that may not be aware of this regulation.

You need to be using at least the first 4 letters of someone's username simply to avoid kicking/naming/etc. all, kicking/naming/etc. others with similar usernames, and any other accidents that can easily occure. It doesn't take much to just include a couple of extra letters when using commands, especially when the result of not doing so can be detrimental to an entire server. 

To new MRs, it's alright if it accidentally happens once, as you're still adjusting to commands. If it becomes a reoccurring issue or you're a more experienced/older MR, that's just being lazy. We are aware that accidents do happen, but they shouldn't be happening simply because you were careless. Lastly, please be on the lookout for usernames that begin with "all", "others", "random", and "nonadmins". You need to pay careful attention when kicking or using commands on people with these usernames. If you're not, everyone in that particular category will have that command done on them.


Best regards,
c6urtney

@bonnie591 i think we shud liek make an announcement telling people to say what they need when they open a ticket because theres a lot of people who just open a ticket without letting us know when they need, then we need to wait a while for dem to responsd


[11-Nov-20 01:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
just close them


[11-Nov-20 01:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they cant be bothered to put anything then just close


[11-Nov-20 01:38 PM] Tattoblue#5828
kk


[11-Nov-20 01:39 PM] anna#0004
ya i looked at them earlier and theres so many with just nothing


[11-Nov-20 01:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
someone can make an announcement if they want, or ill just put something in rules and info

this rule was for the old ticket system


[11-Nov-20 01:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
ill update it


[11-Nov-20 01:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank (We won't start enforcing this until the 13th, so for now just close the tickets) but if someone creates a ticket that is in **TICKET INBOX** and doesn't state what they want then warn and close the ticket. This does not apply to tickets under the **TALKATIVE ROLE REQUESTS CATEGORY**

if you havent heard, roblox is removing the "OOF" sound in ~20 days


[11-Nov-20 04:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
due to a dispute with the original owner of the sound


[11-Nov-20 04:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
That dispute was like


[11-Nov-20 04:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
a year ago right


[11-Nov-20 04:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I remember doing a survey on which sound would be good


[11-Nov-20 04:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
omg


[11-Nov-20 04:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
those are so terrible


[11-Nov-20 04:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
they didn't sound as bad as they did on the survey i did


[11-Nov-20 04:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
sound like they brought their kids to work and recorded a bad audio

Hi folks, still travelling. DM if you need me. Happy reading week.


[12-Nov-20 04:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
@KjRBLX the "OOF" sound will be available for 100 Robux per dev (to use in all that dev's games) to reimplement into the games if the dev decides to buy it


[12-Nov-20 04:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
not too shabby of a price but still sucks overall


[12-Nov-20 04:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
thats work we have to do just to readd a classic sound


[12-Nov-20 07:10 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Prob have to do a new category like instead of sound its called sound effect


[12-Nov-20 07:11 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Then they have properties in studio u can change and insert the id of the sound effect


[12-Nov-20 07:12 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Prob setup like animation security where it doesnt play unless u own it


[12-Nov-20 07:13 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Because i dont see how they would put the sound effects under audio because they say u cant use sound effect unless u own it and with audios u can use them without buying them

Alright, you pay a streaming service to keep watching a streaming service.

[14-Nov-20 10:27 AM] KjRBLX#2053

Greetings HamOnTheGrill, 

I'm messaging you in regards to your current position at Bloxton Hotels. At this moment in time, you're employed as rank 10 | Head Receptionist.  Over the past few months, the High-Rank Team has been monitoring your activity at Bloxton and we have determined that your current activity doesn't meet our standards. If you fail to respond within one week of this letter being sent, then you'll be demoted back to your previous LR position which is rank 7 | Receptionist. Upon your response, we would also appreciate a valid reason for your inactivity without a valid inactive notice to be provided too. 

Regards,

alysseus
Shift Manager 
Bloxton Hotels

jjj6rr banned memelord at the hotel in public chat for being a CB, so now everyone knows his termination reason. some people were talking about it in general discussion


[14-Nov-20 01:37 PM] stacey#1000
Yikes


[14-Nov-20 01:37 PM] stacey#1000

yup seems like hes loving the privilege of seniors being able to ban a little too much

can we get rid of the youtube role


[15-Nov-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
or atleast make it not be the color of there name


[15-Nov-20 03:57 PM] courtney#5125
yeah and why do so many ppl have it that dont meet the req


[15-Nov-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
flyro...


[15-Nov-20 03:58 PM] lyss#0709
flyro shouldnt have sent that but it clearly wasnt to intentionally offend ppl, so they have no right to assume he wasnt banned just bc of who he is


[15-Nov-20 03:58 PM] ethan;#0003
ya ik but also he feels more important then other people


[15-Nov-20 03:58 PM] ethan;#0003
because he has a different role color


[15-Nov-20 03:58 PM] ethan;#0003
same with people with cytoxins office key


[15-Nov-20 03:58 PM] ethan;#0003
it makes there name red.


[15-Nov-20 03:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
It might be wise to kick him cause idk I agree it wasnt intentional but idkkk


[15-Nov-20 03:59 PM] ethan;#0003
kylie just sent me this

Any objections if I kick him for what he posted


[15-Nov-20 03:59 PM] ethan;#0003
can we move the youtube rank below the LR rank


[15-Nov-20 03:59 PM] ethan;#0003
so it doesnt change there role color


[15-Nov-20 04:00 PM] impact#0297
I object.


[15-Nov-20 04:01 PM] impact#0297
You can tell this is just a sustained attack from former MR's and talkatives. I don't sympathize with a mob mentality. They were all OK with him being warned when the messaged initially went.. then when he was warned, they wanted more.


[15-Nov-20 04:02 PM] impact#0297

can't we at least suspend flyro's former role for a while or something? he's clearly done this kind of stuff in the past and it's been passed off as water under the bridge


[15-Nov-20 04:18 PM] katie#0200
^ to be honest, would we have only warned someone else if they did the same thing?


[15-Nov-20 04:19 PM] lyss#0709
a ban would be too strict considering he apologized profusely after sending it and clearly wasnt trying to hurt anyone, but i don't see why we can't take any further action since it was offensive and discriminatory nonetheless


[15-Nov-20 04:20 PM] katie#0200
agreed


[15-Nov-20 04:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
> can we move the youtube rank below the LR rank
@ethan; I agree


[15-Nov-20 04:52 PM] ethan;#0003
i did it minn said yes


[15-Nov-20 04:53 PM] ethan;#0003
it was above the MR team role


[15-Nov-20 04:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh good good


[15-Nov-20 04:53 PM] ethan;#0003
i put it above talkative


[15-Nov-20 04:53 PM] ethan;#0003
but below LR


[15-Nov-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 @katie Holly contacted you regarding flyro?


[15-Nov-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
or no


[15-Nov-20 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
cause Im hearing he sent something in general discussion that offended a lot of people and a senior refused to warn him


[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] katie#0200
yeah @stacey


[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] bonnie591#0591

[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
He was warned


[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
but Madi didnt warn him


[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
But people think it's ban worthy

[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
hes done so much stuff


[15-Nov-20 04:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
Madi is just difficult


[15-Nov-20 04:56 PM] stacey#1000
hes inappropriate in vcs


[15-Nov-20 04:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
She literally added me to a daily ping when I told her not to


[15-Nov-20 04:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
If she continues I'm just gonna issue her official written warnings since we warn lrs for that


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think flyro should be like former Mr role removed at least


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] katie#0200
Yeah


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
And what about his lr position


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Could suspend fire


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Choice is ours


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
I think flyro should be banned from the discord


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
I dont see why he isnt already


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
And his position?


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
hes inappropriate in vcs


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] katie#0200
Yeah wouldn’t we normally ban someone for that anyway?


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
he should be terminated


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
like thats really really offensive to people


[15-Nov-20 04:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ability to reapply or


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
he was blacklisted before


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thing is the image he posted is discrimination and would be a pban if a hotel guest did at the hotel


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
hes basically ruined his chances at this point


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] katie#0200
He has already apologised and he didn’t intend to offend people so


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
I say blacklist again and ban from all platforms


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
yes but this is not his only strike


[15-Nov-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
he may have deleted it


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
but he only said sorry because people complained about it


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
if people said nothing he mightve not


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank if ur online please give your opinion on what punishment flyro should get!


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Banned


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] katie#0200
Tbh I think a ban from the discord is enough, blacklisting and banning from all of our platforms seems a bit extreme


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
His lr position can be removed or suspended and he can be banned just lmk ur opinions

I honestly think ban and suspension from lr position maybe


[15-Nov-20 04:59 PM] ethan;#0003
how many kicks does he have


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
banned


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
blacklist again


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ban


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
or at least ban from the discord


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
He had 7 warnings but they were appealed. Some weren't supposed to be appealed though


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] anna#0004
agreed w katie


[15-Nov-20 05:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think we should just ban and up to u guys what we should do with his lr position


[15-Nov-20 05:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i think he can keep his lr position


[15-Nov-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
alright ban from discord


[15-Nov-20 05:01 PM] emily#4444
ban from discfor sure


[15-Nov-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
hold up im getting more proof of him


[15-Nov-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
that might change your mind on blacklisting


[15-Nov-20 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
Kylie said he had 8 warns but someone now they are gone

Wait


[15-Nov-20 05:02 PM] lyss#0709
ban from the discord, and honestly a blacklist isn't too much of a stretch considering everything he's done and gotten away with in the past imo


[15-Nov-20 05:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
The ones from February was before his ban do that doesn't rlly count to now


[15-Nov-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
honestly he was blacklisted before


[15-Nov-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
and should be blacklisted again


[15-Nov-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
the one I just sent


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
was from this month


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
I don't like how he thinks he's above others sometimes


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
honestly why not blacklist?


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
hes inappropriate, discriminative against everything, and is really rude


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
If others agree then sure


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
he really violates every major rule


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
you discriminate you get pbanned from the hotel...


[15-Nov-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
we shouldnt give him special treatment


[15-Nov-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
he already had a second chance and was appealed from a blacklist


[15-Nov-20 05:04 PM] lyss#0709
tbh if it was anyone else i feel like they would've been long gone by now


[15-Nov-20 05:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
True


[15-Nov-20 05:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
We shouldn't be like treating flyro different


[15-Nov-20 05:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
So I agree with blacklist and ban. He can be banned but u need majority for blacklist


[15-Nov-20 05:06 PM] impact#0297
Sure, we can all preach not treating flyro differently, but if I ban one of your friends, I will refer to this exact moment.


[15-Nov-20 05:07 PM] impact#0297
I think Flyro can be safely banned for the purpose of community outcry, but some of the shit former's have said to each other has been over the top but isn't caught.


[15-Nov-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank Vote to blacklist flyro, he's really done too much stuff. Not just today. He is inappropriate, discriminates against people, and is overall rude. He was appealed and given a second chance and has proved he ruined it.  If you are against his blacklist, please state why so I can hear your opinions.

Ban is fair considering he was banned before and got appealed


[15-Nov-20 05:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
If someone appeals and get banned again then I strongly encourage no appeal this time as he hasn't learnt

yes


[15-Nov-20 05:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Go ahead ban and blacklist


[15-Nov-20 05:11 PM] stacey#1000
alrighty


[15-Nov-20 05:12 PM] impact#0297
I don't really care that Flyro is gone, but I'm very saddened about how it requires a drama incident from former mr's to deliver punishment.


[15-Nov-20 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
banned from discord


[15-Nov-20 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
gonna ban from games now


[15-Nov-20 05:14 PM] impact#0297
In our next meeting, I will be bringing this up, and possibly revamping the rules, considering that his actions barely violated Rule 3.


[15-Nov-20 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
you are given my OK


[15-Nov-20 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
:Zcheck: :3ShinyTeeth:


[15-Nov-20 05:15 PM] impact#0297
I'm not proud to say this but I'm pretty infuriated about how this all turned out.


[15-Nov-20 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
yeah it wasnt very fair how they made it so dramatic


[15-Nov-20 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
especially when they knew it was going to be dealt with


[15-Nov-20 05:16 PM] Polk#1596
i saw a fragment of what they said and it seemed a bit unnecessary


[15-Nov-20 05:16 PM] lyss#0709
how did he barely violate rule 3 tho? he sent an image that was very offensive to many people, and that's not even touching the surface of the other things he's done in the past. sure the people in gd shouldn't have reacted that way, but they did have a right to be upset


[15-Nov-20 05:16 PM] impact#0297
Where in Rule 3 is religion included?


[15-Nov-20 05:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But did he discriminate inside game?


[15-Nov-20 05:17 PM] impact#0297
No, just Discord.


[15-Nov-20 05:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Then I think he should of just been banned in discord.


[15-Nov-20 05:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
People discriminate at the hotel, but don't get banned from TC or IC I believe.


[15-Nov-20 05:17 PM] lyss#0709
this isn't his first time doing it though


[15-Nov-20 05:18 PM] lyss#0709
if it was just this, surely the punishment wouldn't have been as severe, but it's this on top of many other things


[15-Nov-20 05:19 PM] lyss#0709
and he hasn't learned because nothing has really been done in the past. he's just gotten away with a warning or nothing at all


[15-Nov-20 05:19 PM] impact#0297
I know this culture currently exists in modern society, but the cancel culture in this server is fucking ridiculous.


[15-Nov-20 05:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Then why hold that against Flyro if we werent issuing the correct punishments for him when he did it the first time?


[15-Nov-20 05:20 PM] impact#0297
What Flyro did was wrong, I agree -- but look at how many people attacked his past in a matter of an hour. We are a fucking virtual hotel, how did it get to this?


[15-Nov-20 05:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I agree with banning flyro from the discord, but I don't see him as a problem anywhere else.


[15-Nov-20 05:20 PM] lyss#0709
regardless of the way people reacted, i still see it as a fair punishment since it was offensive


[15-Nov-20 05:21 PM] impact#0297
The chat is now realizing Flyro is banned, watch the toxic behavior from the seasonal cancel culture folks (aka formers & talkatives)


[15-Nov-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
he was blacklisted for far more then just what he did today


[15-Nov-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
I've heard many complaints about him being inappropriate and rude to people in general VCs but of course couldn't get evidence since no one could record the VC's


[15-Nov-20 05:23 PM] lyss#0709
i mean, speaking of recording VCs, he's done that too


[15-Nov-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
hes very rude and disrespectful to people as well


[15-Nov-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
he had max warnings before


[15-Nov-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
so this was the final straw


[15-Nov-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
hes blacklisted now


[15-Nov-20 05:25 PM] impact#0297
Stacey, in the past week, how many former MR's have you spoken to you?


[15-Nov-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
Ive had my DMs closed so


[15-Nov-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
none


[15-Nov-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
but Ive had plenty current MRs message me about his behaviour


[15-Nov-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
in regards to moderating the general chat with him


[15-Nov-20 05:26 PM] impact#0297

I mean we cant stop people from realizing he got banned but


[15-Nov-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
they should remain respectful about it


[15-Nov-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
people get banned from the discord all the time


[15-Nov-20 05:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[15-Nov-20 05:34 PM] lyss#0709
if the formers are going to get warned, then certain mrs should be getting warned too. a lot of people including current mrs are being a bit much

[15-Nov-20 05:39 PM] courtney#5125
should ppl who are celebrating flyros ban be warned


[15-Nov-20 05:39 PM] courtney#5125
a manager’s asking


[15-Nov-20 05:39 PM] anna#0004

would u say managers can warn ppl who are celebrating flyros ban


[15-Nov-20 05:43 PM] Polk#1596
Personally I think publicly celebrating over something a bit controversial when being told to stop is a bit much


[15-Nov-20 05:43 PM] Polk#1596

You can if you want Kj, but do it at your own risk. Just because it's really bad there rn


[15-Nov-20 06:01 PM] Polk#1596
We should just remove roles one by one since everyone decided to show their true colors


[15-Nov-20 06:01 PM] courtney#5125

hasnt it been made clear enough that formers seem to care deeply abt having their role removed


[15-Nov-20 08:28 PM] courtney#5125
its a privilege to have it and they represent bloxton with having the role


[15-Nov-20 08:37 PM] lyss#0709
i don't think she understands that having the former MR role doesn't mean you have the privilege to speak, it means you have the privilege to represent the group..

apparently someone was able to see channels they're not authorized to see because of a BetterDiscord plugin or something. i told a senior to ban bc i wasnt able to at the time since they were sending the screenshots in general discussion and clearly weren't planning on stopping

having BetterDiscord installed violates discord's terms and service and anyone who has it runs the risk of their account being disabled according to discord at least, but very odd they were able to see those channels


[17-Nov-20 12:19 AM] Polk#1596
That's just a betterdiscord plugin


[17-Nov-20 12:21 AM] Polk#1596
When we realized people could do that, we decided to stop considering the existence of those channels classified, but still try not to talk about them

Well she still got 75% for that one week so


[18-Nov-20 09:04 AM] ethan;#0003
She has done a total of 87% in two weeks


[18-Nov-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
so she has improved a bit


[18-Nov-20 09:05 AM] ethan;#0003
Yeah but let’s see how long it lasts...


[18-Nov-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000

[18-Nov-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
she can keep her rank for now but if it goes bad again


[18-Nov-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000

[18-Nov-20 09:06 AM] ethan;#0003

[18-Nov-20 09:06 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[18-Nov-20 09:06 AM] ethan;#0003
Week after 15%


[18-Nov-20 09:06 AM] ethan;#0003
Then 0


[18-Nov-20 09:06 AM] ethan;#0003
Becus so far this week she has 0%


[18-Nov-20 09:06 AM] stacey#1000

theyre basically pressing enter or doing a bunch of spaces to make their username and the bypassed words show up below, which makes it seem like, in this case, 15kdiiior and Ashley_Jers bypassed. i said smthg in management discussion to just say that it was a thing. i dont really think an announcement is needed considering its a pretty easy thing to catch, but ykkk

[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
that didnt happen when iw as there


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
Did you see Fearne at your training


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
must of been before


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
was she in your server


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
I think you should verbally warn her


[19-Nov-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
For her actions


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
trainings ended already


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
It happened when the manager was there


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
No but like dm her I think


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
To like warn her for being inappropriate


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
What did she do?


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
So then she knows at least


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
I don't see her doing anything in those pictures


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
Did you read what Olivia sent me


[19-Nov-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
Like what Olivia said


[19-Nov-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
The first photo


[19-Nov-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
there is no image of her doing the sleeping emote


[19-Nov-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
and it could of just been a total accident


[19-Nov-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
yeah I know she couldn’t get the evidence of that


[19-Nov-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
but like I guess just keep an eye on her


[19-Nov-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000

I think he has some type of autism where he just tries to help with everything


[20-Nov-20 12:18 PM] ethan;#0003

"dunt wana fail interweivs" is the first part of it


[20-Nov-20 12:19 PM] Polk#1596
and then he says that


[20-Nov-20 12:19 PM] Polk#1596
which is literally the only difficult part


[20-Nov-20 12:19 PM] Polk#1596
well idk about autism but he definitely does go out of his way to do a bit too much @ethan;


[20-Nov-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
No it’s some form of autism, I can see it in the way he speaks


[20-Nov-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003

[21-Nov-20 02:45 PM] courtney#5125
allowing multiple languages would make interviews much longer when ppl have to translate things word for word.. and if the staff member passes then theyll have to do the same thing at training, so does she just expect the trainer to translate their entire guide into that language whilst training everybody else orrr? and if the person manages to get past that, theyre going to have a really hard time working at the hotel and dealing with guests when no one can understand them and they cant understand anyone else 😳


[21-Nov-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
Welp


[21-Nov-20 02:46 PM] courtney#5125
alsooo when can kenzi appeal for her former role? she says that someone told her around december but she was asking for an exact date if possible


[21-Nov-20 02:46 PM] courtney#5125
around christmas*


[21-Nov-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[21-Nov-20 02:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
We can't have staff members talking to guests in a different language


[21-Nov-20 02:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
It'll cause confusion


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
We're an English based hotel and thats our primary language


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
Plus it'd add more stress for MRs and HRs


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
Yes I explained that to her


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think it'd cause more negativity than positivity


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
It’s just a lot more unneeded work


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
Mhm


[21-Nov-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
Idk what else to tell Imag


[21-Nov-20 02:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
Just mention the points me and candy mentioned here and leave it at that; she can't keep fighting it as we've put up a strong counter-argument to her suggestion


[21-Nov-20 02:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's not like its a major issue either, its very unnecessary


[21-Nov-20 02:52 PM] stacey#1000
Yes and if she still has an issue I’ll tell her to dm you


[21-Nov-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
It would be nice to have people speak different languages work there but


[21-Nov-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
A lot of work for that


[21-Nov-20 02:53 PM] courtney#5125
does anyone know when kenzi's able to appeal for her former role? she was told by someone that she could around christmas but she doesnt know the exact date. and if no one knows then can we decided on a date for her to appeal for ittttt


[21-Nov-20 02:54 PM] lyss#0709
ive literally encountered like 3 people max who've wanted a job but don't speak english so it can't be that big of a problem


[21-Nov-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
Idk who banned Kenzi


[21-Nov-20 02:55 PM] courtney#5125
no shes not banned, she just wants to appeal for her former role


[21-Nov-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[21-Nov-20 02:56 PM] stacey#1000
Idk who took her former role


[21-Nov-20 02:56 PM] stacey#1000
If she’s done nothing major I don’t see why she couldn’t appeal for it


[21-Nov-20 02:56 PM] courtney#5125
it was taken a long time ago, but she tried to appeal it over a month ago and it was declined due to her being disrespectful in the discord server a few days prior


[21-Nov-20 02:57 PM] courtney#5125
and then apparently someone told her she could appeal around christmas but i have no idea who or when


[21-Nov-20 02:57 PM] courtney#5125
and i dont think shes done anything wrong since it was declined on october 12th


[21-Nov-20 02:57 PM] courtney#5125
as far as ik


[21-Nov-20 02:57 PM] stacey#1000
I mean she could always send in an appeal on December 12 then just post it here and we can discuss it then


[21-Nov-20 02:58 PM] stacey#1000
And if there was major issues then she wouldn’t get it


[21-Nov-20 02:58 PM] courtney#5125
okk ill let her know


[21-Nov-20 02:58 PM] courtney#5125
ty stacey!


[21-Nov-20 03:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Only time it wouldn't like be hard for translating is if roblox did it for us..


[21-Nov-20 03:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like when you chat


[21-Nov-20 03:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ur client will translate it for u to ur set language


[21-Nov-20 03:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I don't know any other language. I only know English.


[21-Nov-20 03:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and plus, I haven't seen but like two people who spoke spanish at interviews.


[21-Nov-20 03:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and usually umsimplex or nxcturn would volunteer to take them


[21-Nov-20 03:19 PM] Polk#1596
i cant be bothered reading the whole thing but ace showed me an MR interviewing someone in french


[21-Nov-20 03:19 PM] Polk#1596
and ive told them we are an english speaking community, if they cant even understand the questions in english, they wont be able to work here properly


[21-Nov-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
yes they would be able to communicate amazingly with those 10 people that visits the hotel from the same country


[21-Nov-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
but english is necessary


[21-Nov-20 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure they can speak French at interviews idc but they can't speak French at the hotel


[21-Nov-20 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
So


[21-Nov-20 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Pretty much no as they can't speak English leading to not being able to work


[21-Nov-20 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh wait is there a thing where it translates it at the hote


[21-Nov-20 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hotel


[21-Nov-20 06:12 PM] Fraux#7971

Doge's Reinstatement Application Letter
Reinstatement Application Letter 22th of November, 2020   * this document has been written and consists of backgrounds behind to what originally happened at my termination, and why this action should take serious reconsideration beforehand into reinstatement of my former position, Senior Managem...

:Bruh:


[22-Nov-20 12:07 PM] courtney#5125
he literally did nothing for the senior team or the mr team in general. its hard to imagine hes wanting to come back simply so he can be active


[22-Nov-20 12:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah bringing him back is kinda risky


[22-Nov-20 12:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
idk why he wants to be a senior again so badly


[22-Nov-20 12:18 PM] courtney#5125
his excuses arent really the best either. he was inactive for months with no notice, we gave him plenty of time to fix it, he didnt do anything nor did he even try, all notices can only be a max of a month long at a time so its not like anything was unfair like he was saying, and what major benefits will he even bring if we let him back? he had a fair shot and he blew it, fair and square. he doesnt get to come back to just go inactive again or flaunt that he was falsely demoted and got to come back. not to mention hes been pretty rude and almost toxic in the discord server since he was demoted, so idk why we'd even consider bringing back negativity to the mr team


[22-Nov-20 12:22 PM] lyss#0709
all he did in the letter was blame people, he doesn't even talk about how if he were to be reinstated, he'd actually be active and make changes

[22-Nov-20 01:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
i still believe his demotion is legit and he shouldn't be reinstated.


[22-Nov-20 01:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
if he came back, its gonna be the same shit of being inactive for a long period of time and MAYBE coming back when you have a week break from school. he was inactive for the majority of summer break too without a notice which just shows pure incompetence. his demotion was earned and theres no good reason to bring him back its just gonna add another inactive senior on our hands.


[22-Nov-20 01:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
also i think we should look into seniors and other mr ranks too who have inactive notices pretty much all year and just come on for like a month per year in summer. i get they have school but come on at least complete something like applications or 1 session. if you cannot do that since you're so busy then you may as well resign as senior isn't just a part time job. we have a rank limit for senior which is tight and it doesnt help when so many seniors are on notice


[22-Nov-20 01:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
like i get they might need to go inactive for a month or so but only do it when you have important exams, not for the whole year


[22-Nov-20 01:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
also he mentioned frauxs inactivity but he had a legit reason for it sooo


[22-Nov-20 01:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I say we give it until after mid December cause rn people are getting ready for exams (including myself) cause really after December if they’re still busy with school and have to be inactive to focus on school then yeah like bonnie said, they might as well resign. no point in being inactive majority of the year, come back for summer and then go inactive.


[22-Nov-20 01:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
And he mentioned drews inactivity when drew legit didn’t even have a computer lol but drew still managed to do somethings


[22-Nov-20 01:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Periodically


[22-Nov-20 01:46 PM] Fraux#7971
cute how he mentioned me but i had a valid notice during my activity , plus I was like NEVER on discord or roblox during that notice 🧐


[22-Nov-20 01:47 PM] Fraux#7971
@Tattoblue as of right now i would agree with those pms being really long


[22-Nov-20 01:47 PM] Fraux#7971
like managers don’t need to be taught how to do their job by the seniors each and every session


[22-Nov-20 01:48 PM] Fraux#7971
plus they’re actually busy doing stuff so they shouldn’t have to read an entire paragraph. make it short and to the point with only necessary information


[22-Nov-20 01:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Now what do they count as too many pms


[22-Nov-20 01:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Cuz ill send atmost is 3


[22-Nov-20 01:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But they’re not long paragraphs


[22-Nov-20 01:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I couldnt even read the responses because my wifi wont load them on phone


[22-Nov-20 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
If Doqee came back, he’s just going to leak everything and start a tea doc.


[22-Nov-20 01:52 PM] stacey#1000
It’s way too risky to bring him back.


[22-Nov-20 01:52 PM] stacey#1000
He was terminated and is upset about it, what’s to stop him from leaking???


[22-Nov-20 01:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And didnt baby introduce a idea to not ban anyone unless they did something


[22-Nov-20 01:53 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I understand that it was tried in the past but maybe we should give it ago again


[22-Nov-20 01:53 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It would get rid of cb related questions


[22-Nov-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I think we should do that


[22-Nov-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Get rid of cb rule itself tbh


[22-Nov-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Stop banning for being a cb and only ban for legit reasons


[22-Nov-20 01:54 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah I agree


[22-Nov-20 01:54 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Causes a lot of confusion


[22-Nov-20 01:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yes it wouldnt really cause extra ban load, it will either really decrease or just stay the same because its kinda just the same folks


[22-Nov-20 01:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Decrease if cb doesnt do anything and expect to get ban for “cb”


[22-Nov-20 01:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And stay the same if the cb (who did nothing and get banned for nothing) but now starts doing stuff to get banned


[22-Nov-20 01:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Really hard to explain over text but u get the gist


[22-Nov-20 02:02 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But where would that leave appealing a cb? The same time limit or just allow them to appeal based on what they did and lower their chances based on how many alts they made?


[22-Nov-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
Still same time and tbh I don’t think I’d appeal any of them at least there is a handful I would never appeal. Rack, Diego, Sooty, Funterrible, etc would never appeal those ones


[22-Nov-20 02:22 PM] anna#0004

Greetings HamOnTheGrill,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been demoted from your position as Head Receptionist to Receptionist at Bloxton Hotels as of November 22nd, 2020, at 7:00 PM CST. The reasoning behind your demotion is due to extreme inactivity within the MR team. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a demotion in order to ensure our company is running at the best it can. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

alysseus
Shift Manager

@KjRBLX ranking services r easier than u think


[25-Nov-20 10:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
promoting someone is like 1 line of code


[25-Nov-20 10:35 PM] Beartikal#9760

[27-Nov-20 10:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
HUH


[27-Nov-20 10:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[27-Nov-20 10:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmm..I got a email two hours ago saying that something was trying to access my gyazo account


[27-Nov-20 10:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They got the password and email correct.


[27-Nov-20 10:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I typed in the IP Address into the web browser and it took me a Tor IP.


[27-Nov-20 10:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
SO definitely not me


[27-Nov-20 10:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So I gotta go threw and find every account related to that password and change the password


[27-Nov-20 10:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Deleted all my gyazo captures tho just incase they get access because I might of had some confidential channels gifs on there


[27-Nov-20 10:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmm just realized i gotta delete browsing history too on gyazo


[28-Nov-20 12:12 AM] Beartikal#9760

[28-Nov-20 12:12 AM] Beartikal#9760

[28-Nov-20 12:17 AM] ethan;#0003
im in a call with mel and kylie and they are saying that pzoky is a cb


[28-Nov-20 12:17 AM] ethan;#0003
and cheifjohntawnee has leaked to CB's


[28-Nov-20 12:18 AM] KjRBLX#2053
😐


[28-Nov-20 12:19 AM] KjRBLX#2053
That video scared me even when i used the playback scroller.


[28-Nov-20 12:19 AM] KjRBLX#2053
but didn't someone suspect poky to be a cb


[28-Nov-20 12:20 AM] ethan;#0003
yes


[28-Nov-20 12:21 AM] ethan;#0003
it seems like kylie and mel know a LOT of info about mrs


[28-Nov-20 12:21 AM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah, sitting in vc with them..u learn a lot about behind the scenes


[28-Nov-20 12:23 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Kylie even told me about a very problematic former owner of sugarbowl or something


[28-Nov-20 12:23 AM] KjRBLX#2053
i think he was a former


[28-Nov-20 12:23 AM] ethan;#0003
they also said


[28-Nov-20 12:23 AM] ethan;#0003
aivdan

[28-Nov-20 12:24 AM] ethan;#0003
cus


[28-Nov-20 12:24 AM] ethan;#0003
he was acting kinda sus in my dms


[28-Nov-20 12:24 AM] ethan;#0003
for a few days


[28-Nov-20 12:24 AM] ethan;#0003
like 2 months ago


[28-Nov-20 12:25 AM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn u should read this


[28-Nov-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
we had suspicions of CheifJohnTawnee leaking in the past


[28-Nov-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
and i think also aivan


[28-Nov-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
and pzoky being a cb also


[28-Nov-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn CLOSE FIRESTONE FOR ONE SECOND AND READ THIS


[28-Nov-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
OR I WILL COME AND SHOOT YOU


[28-Nov-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
WILL MY AK


[28-Nov-20 12:37 AM] stacey#1000
@ethan; aivdan has already been suspended before for questioning and we have never gotten solid evidence against him of him leaking


[28-Nov-20 12:37 AM] stacey#1000
Do Mel and Kylie show any actual proof?


[28-Nov-20 12:38 AM] ethan;#0003
not sure


[28-Nov-20 12:38 AM] ethan;#0003
they just brought it up for like a second


[28-Nov-20 12:38 AM] ethan;#0003
and then the topic changed


[28-Nov-20 04:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Isnt polks sessions always like a themed session


[28-Nov-20 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
@katie yeah Lee shouldn’t be doing that. He should be warned


[28-Nov-20 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk since this was at your session did you speak to him and see him do anything? Like did you warn him or anything


[28-Nov-20 04:40 PM] Polk#1596
i agree that he got too comfortable with the tools he was given, but holly cant really say much when she kicked him @katie @stacey


[28-Nov-20 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
lee thought it was just jokes


[28-Nov-20 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
so if holly is serious about that, i'd like to see her not do it back


[28-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
they could both be warned idk


[28-Nov-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
If it was your session you could just remind them to be more professional with btools and such


[28-Nov-20 04:48 PM] Polk#1596
nono not warn @stacey


[28-Nov-20 04:48 PM] Polk#1596
they were both doing that without anyone seeing it


[28-Nov-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
No I mean like


[28-Nov-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
Reminding them


[28-Nov-20 04:48 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Nov-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
The person could of been racist


[29-Nov-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
And he is just saying they are racist


[29-Nov-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
that is not bannable


[29-Nov-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
calling someone racist


[29-Nov-20 05:50 PM] impact#0297
Cool -- I'll let the Seniors know racism is not bannable.


[29-Nov-20 05:51 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Nov-20 06:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[29-Nov-20 07:03 PM] courtney#5125
yeah ive had numerous times this week where I needed to ask for 2-4 seniors, and there were times when I didn’t get any that even asked me

np!


[29-Nov-20 09:25 PM] Fraux#7971
I’d say 2 because as Bloo was saying people are going to be heading into holiday breaks soon and activity is going to be increasing. Plus, colder weather means more snow days, etc to play roblox, also covid is getting increasingly bad so we may begin to see certain schools closing again, I know I’ve seen a few

[30-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
panda express grows very very very very very slow


[30-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
very very very very very slow


[30-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
the owner negelected the group for 2 years until the name got deleted


[30-Nov-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
so they still have a good amount of members


[30-Nov-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
then he started to pay attention to it


[30-Nov-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
they changed their name and now it seems to be very active


[30-Nov-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
idk just thought id try to make the alliance board alive


[30-Nov-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Nov-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Nov-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000

[30-Nov-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000

[30-Nov-20 08:08 PM] Fraux#7971
panda express, on october 20 2018, had around 44,743 members. currently they have 74,646


[30-Nov-20 08:09 PM] Fraux#7971
thats about 30,000 members in 2 years


[30-Nov-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
venti????!?!?!?


[30-Nov-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
nobody expected them to get this far


[30-Nov-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
they are almost at 70k members


[30-Nov-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
they sure exceeded our expectations from when they sent us an alliance app


[30-Nov-20 08:10 PM] Fraux#7971
wow that was very quick for venti


[30-Nov-20 08:10 PM] Fraux#7971

[30-Nov-20 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Nov-20 08:18 PM] Fraux#7971
i definitely think we should revisit it in a few months perhaps


[30-Nov-20 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
panda has a good community, but the owner neglects the group and doesnt let it grow


[30-Nov-20 08:19 PM] Fraux#7971
Oh yeah doesn't the owner not do like anything


[30-Nov-20 08:19 PM] Fraux#7971
I could've sworn someone said he literally couldn't care less about it


[30-Nov-20 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
he did


[30-Nov-20 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
he was speaking in firestone and i asked him about panda


[30-Nov-20 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
he said that was the least of his worries


[30-Nov-20 08:20 PM] ethan;#0003

I wish Tsunami would make a new version


[30-Nov-20 08:21 PM] ethan;#0003
tsunami is growing like crazy


[30-Nov-20 08:21 PM] ethan;#0003
when they changed owners the group just took off


[30-Nov-20 08:21 PM] ethan;#0003
took them like 6 years to get 100k


[30-Nov-20 08:21 PM] ethan;#0003
almost at 200k now


[30-Nov-20 08:21 PM] ethan;#0003
in under 6 months


[30-Nov-20 08:21 PM] Fraux#7971
Yess I know, I like Tsunami


[30-Nov-20 08:22 PM] Fraux#7971
It's such an old group it's pretty iconic


[30-Nov-20 08:22 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Nov-20 08:22 PM] Fraux#7971

[30-Nov-20 08:24 PM] Fraux#7971
Since we're on the topic of allies now, can we bring up clay's and breezys once again like @ethan; said


[30-Nov-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
i think we should ask baby and bear


[30-Nov-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
cus idk if any hrs know


[30-Nov-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Nov-20 08:27 PM] ethan;#0003
@Hilton Founder hi sory for ping but we are wondering why r we still allied with breezys and clays cheap clothing


[30-Nov-20 08:27 PM] ethan;#0003
they have been dead for years


[30-Nov-20 08:27 PM] Fraux#7971
Like we aren't benefitting from the alliance, but they also aren't benefitting from it


[30-Nov-20 08:27 PM] ethan;#0003
they are so dead they dont even have staff


[30-Nov-20 08:27 PM] Fraux#7971
Yeah


[30-Nov-20 08:30 PM] katie#0200
Didn’t we send the 1970s an ally request before


[30-Nov-20 08:30 PM] katie#0200
But they declined it


[30-Nov-20 08:30 PM] katie#0200
Idk I can’t quite remember


[30-Nov-20 08:30 PM] Beartikal#9760

[30-Nov-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
its for formalities


[30-Nov-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
we arent allied with them like the other allies


[30-Nov-20 08:31 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Nov-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760

[30-Nov-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
