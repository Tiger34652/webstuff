@impact I know youre great with stats, but can we have a few people focus on these weekly and update the group via the weekly meetings on these numbers?

[01-Aug-20 12:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yes


[01-Aug-20 12:20 PM] katie#0200
or is that something else


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
venti has something like it


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
its linked with discord


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
they run a command and it shows how much time they where at the cafe for


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] courtney#5125
i say yes, considering time isnt the only thing that contributes towards a promotion. wed also look at their reports and overall skills/personality, but time is still a factor


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] courtney#5125
would mrs need to know we have it tho?


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
one of there devs made it


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
its custom


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Cam#5887
oh yeah thats true candy


[01-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Cam#5887
i dont think tbh


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887
no


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] anna#0004
no


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
No


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887
i dont think we should


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
No


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no cause then they're just gonna go to the hotel more just cause they know we have one


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] courtney#5125
bc if they know we're keeping track, then they might just go afk. but if they know we're keeping track, they could also just start being active at the hotel all of a sudden. im conflicted w that


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] anna#0004
yeah what bloo said


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] katie#0200
what candy said


[01-Aug-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
We shouldn’t tell anyone else because then people could go to the hotel be afk and get good time off of that. Exactly what candy said yes


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t see why not


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Sure


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] anna#0004
i think for the reporting ones


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] anna#0004
ya


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] ethan;#0003
why would a head break a rule


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] Cam#5887
true


[01-Aug-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
Heads don’t usually need to be warned with dyno


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve never seen it happen


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Cam#5887
hmmmhmhmhm


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] anna#0004
i think for the ones where they break a rule whilst reporting then use dyno but for other rules, we usually just deal with that


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Cam#5887
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, i dont think they do tbh anymore


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] courtney#5125
for rules like disrespect, excessive swearing, etc, theyd probably be talked to by an hr. with that being said, tho, theyre all aware of the rules and i hardly come across a head that breaks a rule, personally


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Cam#5887
they are MRs


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Cam#5887
should know better overall


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] katie#0200
If a head breaks a rule we should be notified


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah true


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] ethan;#0003
it will just raise the ego of managers


[01-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Polk#1596

[01-Aug-20 12:26 PM] anna#0004

mhm


[01-Aug-20 12:28 PM] katie#0200
I don’t see why we should make an announcement for it, if we just tell MRs then they will make the choice to leave or not


[01-Aug-20 12:28 PM] katie#0200
Ye


[01-Aug-20 12:28 PM] anna#0004

[01-Aug-20 12:29 PM] courtney#5125
PHEW


[01-Aug-20 12:29 PM] ethan;#0003
we can announce it in mr announcements and say like you have one week to leave all cb servers and after that 1 week we make a public announcement


[01-Aug-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
ay ryan is it cool if i make an announcement about the operations board


[01-Aug-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887

ok


[01-Aug-20 12:31 PM] courtney#5125
if theyre on the server its still giving the cbs one more reason to keep doing what theyre doing


[01-Aug-20 12:31 PM] courtney#5125
shouldnt they at least be asked to leave


[01-Aug-20 12:31 PM] anna#0004

:bloxton3: **INTRODUCING: Bloxton Hotels [Operations Board]** :bloxton3: 

Greetings, @ everyone! Today, I am announcing a new board that I've been working on for a few weeks now. I'd like to introduce our newest Trello board, the **Bloxton Hotels [Operations Board]**!

Some of you may be asking, "What is this board?" "What is it used for?"

The simple explanation to this: This board is where all of Bloxton's Operations go as far as at the hotel, to training, to interview, all over. It is a basic board where we have all of our operations at Bloxton!

The board is opened for the general public as of today. This board holds much information, so, before you go and ask a Middle-Rank or High-Rank a question, feel free to look here!

**[Board Link 🔗]: https://trello.com/b/Lyxq8J8X/bloxton-hotels-operations-board**

Have a great rest of your day!

All best,
**cam_s**
**Shift Manager**
**Bloxton Hotels**

Opinions regarding the new rule
vUn1x; (Uni):    Introduction  Greetings readers, thank you for taking your time to read this document. I highly appreciate that you would like to hear my opinions regarding the new rule for ban appeals.  As you may know, I’m not a High Rank so my opinion won’t have much effec...

[01-Aug-20 12:36 PM] Cam#5887
wait


[01-Aug-20 12:36 PM] Cam#5887
were they against the rule?


[01-Aug-20 12:36 PM] anna#0004
ive had a look at it


[01-Aug-20 12:36 PM] Cam#5887
oh yeah makes sense


[01-Aug-20 12:36 PM] Cam#5887
okay


[01-Aug-20 12:37 PM] courtney#5125
none of the cbs are even close to the point sadder and swan were at


[01-Aug-20 12:37 PM] Cam#5887
yeah ofc


[01-Aug-20 12:37 PM] ethan;#0003
didnt we have suspicons of Uni having some connection to Cb's


[01-Aug-20 12:37 PM] courtney#5125
they troll then the next day want to appeal, they clearly didnt learn anything during that time


[01-Aug-20 12:37 PM] anna#0004
yeah thats fine but all the cbs just tried to appeal at the same time and they hadnt shown any signs of improvement so i dont think rn is th best time


[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] Cam#5887
so. my question


[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] courtney#5125
if they took several months as a break, then ya i think they should at least have a chance to appeal. but i dont think any can appeal right now


[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] Cam#5887
should we make a time limit for good behavior?


[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] courtney#5125
theyre not even close to the point sadder and swan were at when they appealed


[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] courtney#5125
yes


[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] courtney#5125

[01-Aug-20 12:38 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] courtney#5125
they need to actually improve


[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] Cam#5887
this is what happens on horror moviues


[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] Cam#5887
okay


[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] Cam#5887
nvm hes back we good


[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg


[01-Aug-20 12:41 PM] anna#0004
not from me


[01-Aug-20 12:41 PM] courtney#5125
not that ik of


[01-Aug-20 12:42 PM] ethan;#0003
i almost never engage in it


[01-Aug-20 12:42 PM] ethan;#0003
i never speak in general


[01-Aug-20 12:42 PM] katie#0200
If the announcement causes backlash, I believe we should let general discussion say what they have to say. However, if any rules are broken, take appropriate action and possibly put on slow mode if there’s too much spam


[01-Aug-20 12:42 PM] courtney#5125
well ignoring all of them makes it worse


[01-Aug-20 12:43 PM] courtney#5125
im not sure. i just feel like showing patience and explaining and answering their questions (rather than making managers answer in #questions, considering they might not even understand too much) isnt helpful for them


[01-Aug-20 12:43 PM] courtney#5125
*is helpful for them


[01-Aug-20 12:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah it does


[01-Aug-20 12:43 PM] courtney#5125
slowmode doesnt help, it just makes everyone frustrated


[01-Aug-20 12:44 PM] anna#0004
yes


[01-Aug-20 12:44 PM] courtney#5125

im pretty sure that new server insights thing


[01-Aug-20 12:44 PM] ethan;#0003
you can see how many messages are sent


[01-Aug-20 12:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[01-Aug-20 12:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[01-Aug-20 01:08 PM] stacey#1000
Ok thoughts


[01-Aug-20 01:09 PM] stacey#1000
CB RULE UPDATE

Greetings, Managers and Seniors. 

The HR team has discussed the new rule regarding CBs not being permitted to appeal further. We have reached an agreement that CBs may only be permitted to appeal if they reach the following requirements:

-They have not trolled or committed any major offences for 5 months or longer. 
-They have not trash talked or harassed any members of the Bloxton community during these 5 months. 
-They have shown they truly deserve the chance to appeal. 
-Their appeal has a lot of detail and remorse shown. 

Currently, there is no CBs that have proven they deserve the chance to appeal, so as of right now they cannot appeal. But, if they truly want the chance to appeal they must meet these requirements. If they do want the chance to appeal, they have this opportunity. Of course, even if they do send in an appeal it does not guarantee it will be accepted as it will be entirely up to the HR team. This does give CBs a chance to appeal if they truly show they have changed. 

So, if a CB messages you wanting to appeal, you can inform them they must wait at least 5 months to appeal, and they may send in an appeal at that time. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this, feel free to contact any member of the HR team. 

Best regards,
staceyvx
General Manager 
Bloxton Hotels.

[01-Aug-20 01:27 PM] katie#0200
I don’t like his attitude at all

Yeah....idk what’s up with his attitude right now....


[01-Aug-20 01:28 PM] courtney#5125
oml


[01-Aug-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
I thought when he resigned his attitude would change


[01-Aug-20 01:28 PM] courtney#5125
clearly got worse ig..


[01-Aug-20 01:32 PM] anna#0004
its weird too bc if he was still an HR and that was a different former, he would be dealing with it and he would probably be saying what we're saying right now, but now he is doing it too


[01-Aug-20 01:32 PM] stacey#1000
I mean he always had a bit of an attitude but I didn’t think it was this bad


[01-Aug-20 01:36 PM] ethan;#0003
can weee promote frauxxxxx


[01-Aug-20 01:37 PM] impact#0297

[01-Aug-20 02:03 PM] katie#0200

Yeah let’s wait


[01-Aug-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
Fraux is a good candidate for sure but we still done need a new shift at the moment


[01-Aug-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
Dont*


[01-Aug-20 02:06 PM] impact#0297

[01-Aug-20 02:09 PM] impact#0297
also


[01-Aug-20 02:09 PM] impact#0297
i'm talking to baby and bear about this one


[01-Aug-20 02:09 PM] impact#0297
but I would like fraux on our team


[01-Aug-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
I would as well he is the senior that has been there the longest and has shown great qualities for sure


[01-Aug-20 02:10 PM] courtney#5125
would we do 1 or 2 at that point tho?


[01-Aug-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
He could definitely benefit the team


[01-Aug-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t see why we need 2 right now


[01-Aug-20 02:10 PM] courtney#5125
well yeah


[01-Aug-20 02:11 PM] courtney#5125
we're waiting a bit for even 1


[01-Aug-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[01-Aug-20 02:11 PM] anna#0004
one thing i know for sure is we're good session wise, we seem to always have the board pretty much full throughout the day with sessions and i think we've been pretty good with reviewing and stuff


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] katie#0200
Yeah


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] courtney#5125
right, a new shift isnt necessary atm


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] katie#0200
Mack used to clear the board all the time so it’s getting a bit much rn but other than that I think we’re fine for now


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
The management board still fills up a lot tbh


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
Ban requests are a lot


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
And hotel activity is up as well


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] katie#0200
Yeah I would host more banning sessions but I’m abroad rn soo lol


[01-Aug-20 02:12 PM] courtney#5125
yes but we just get a heck of a lot of reports too, along with a lot of hotel activity


[01-Aug-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
We shouldn’t look at just sessions when it comes to hiring new HRs. Remember there is a lot more to being an HR than hosting


[01-Aug-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
We could honestly use an extra hand in ban requests


[01-Aug-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
With a bigger group it’s more activity for sure, but that also means more HRs when needed


[01-Aug-20 02:13 PM] anna#0004
yeah sometimes candy and i will head down and clear out some bans but we'd only do one board since two is a bit much with just us two and then we have u guys who do banning sessions which is good, but i think whenever we have time we could always head down and clear a few :D


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] courtney#5125
yess!


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
see the thing with the management board, I always see that as a given. We’re a pretty big group ya know, and I feel like no matter how many hrs we have, it’s always going to get full pretty fast


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] katie#0200
Yeah definitely


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] katie#0200
True


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] anna#0004
yeah and what fills the boards rlly quick are the cb reports and duplicates


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Like we can clear the cards today and they’re at 500 again tomorrow


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] courtney#5125
yes agreed with bloo. we're just a large group and we'll always have a lot of ban requests, theres not much we can do abt it


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] katie#0200
They’re mainly CBs so


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn’t hurt to have another persons opinion around as well


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] anna#0004
they aree


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] anna#0004
mhm


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] katie#0200
Yeah


[01-Aug-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
I think it couldn’t hurt to get another HR


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
We just lost one last week so


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe 1 could be a benefit


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] courtney#5125
cant wait to deal with bman ranting abt his replacement


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] courtney#5125
oml


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] anna#0004
bmans reaction to us promoting lrs/mrs was "theyre replacing me" and imagine his reaction to a new HR coming on :flushed:


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
I mean there is bound to be a new HR at some point anyways


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ikr, I mean we’re gonna have to-


[01-Aug-20 02:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
lol


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] anna#0004
yes


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It’s not always gonna be empty


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
I really think getting 1 soon wouldn’t hurt it would be a benefit


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] courtney#5125
right


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
But I don’t think we need 2 for sure


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] anna#0004
also i dont see it as we're replacing him, we're just doing whats necessary to help the group


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] anna#0004
yea stacey


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
why the change of mind all of a sudden


[01-Aug-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
Because it’s been a week and after reviewing it more I think it wouldn’t hurt


[01-Aug-20 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
Seeing how it is with bman gone and everything

I’m personally still okay with how we’re doing now but if y’all want a new hr I mean I’m not totally against it, just not needed ASAP cause like I said we’re doing fairly good rn with the amount of hrs we have now which is good cause before we used to have 17 hrs, rn we have 14 and we’re doing just as good


[01-Aug-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
Bloo is writing an essay


[01-Aug-20 02:18 PM] courtney#5125
i mean tbh i kinda like the idea of two but itd be kinda hard to choose lol


[01-Aug-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
We have 13 not 14


[01-Aug-20 02:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
i guess we can get one more if you guys want. not two tho


[01-Aug-20 02:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
i was planning on waiting and hiring 2 in future but uh hiring 1 at a time brings them in easy


[01-Aug-20 02:19 PM] courtney#5125
oh yeah thats also true


[01-Aug-20 02:19 PM] bonnie591#0591

His attitude recently is kinda just negativity shown towards the group


[01-Aug-20 02:20 PM] Cam#5887
fraux for sm


[01-Aug-20 02:20 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] Cam#5887
thats my vote tho!!


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] stacey#1000

[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we hire one its gonna be hardd but


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] Cam#5887
idk about bman


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
my idea is


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
to discuss EVERY senior in a meeting


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
and then vote


[01-Aug-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
so we can consider our options


[01-Aug-20 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
If we get a vote I’ll go from there


[01-Aug-20 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
I also have other candidates I like as well

Yes, we'll get back to you guys on the new shift. Bear & I are just deciding if another shift would be useful to us based on the activity we've seen here.


[01-Aug-20 02:31 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 02:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Good work everyone 👍


[01-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
Oh now idk how tf my alt acc still surviving in the CB server


[01-Aug-20 02:37 PM] courtney#5125
have they questioned u at all?


[01-Aug-20 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
They kicked out all the people that had no roles and that they didn’t trust. But because I was smart I reacted to get the gamenights and polls role to get roles. They didn’t kick me out for some reason and then questioned who I was then 2 seconds later moved on and didn’t care. There is legit only cbs, the MRs that got fired, and no other MRs in the server.


[01-Aug-20 02:37 PM] stacey#1000

Swearing is a ban.


[01-Aug-20 02:54 PM] Cam#5887
Discord ToS violation is also a ban.


[01-Aug-20 02:54 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
Are you guys proud my alt account is still somehow surviving on the cb server after it blew up 2 times and they banned like 15 people they didn’t trust. No more people in it that worry me so it’s all solved for right now


[01-Aug-20 02:56 PM] courtney#5125
HOWWWW is it still in there omg


[01-Aug-20 02:56 PM] courtney#5125
like they questioned it and as soon as someone said its a random lr they just completely moved on


[01-Aug-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
Yep


[01-Aug-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
Lmao


[01-Aug-20 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
Obv they all have alt accs in the Bloxton server rn


[01-Aug-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
My work with the cb server is complete for now. I made their server blow up twice, kicked out 2 mrs, and other MRs left the server and they kicked everyone else out minus the cbs and mrs that were fired.


[01-Aug-20 03:03 PM] courtney#5125
theyre clueless LMAO


[01-Aug-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Yep because I’m still somehow surviving. To them “I’m a random inactive LR”


[01-Aug-20 03:04 PM] courtney#5125
now youd THINK that would be kind of suspicious that youre suddenly in the server and things are still being leaked


[01-Aug-20 03:04 PM] courtney#5125
but nope


[01-Aug-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
Nothing is being leaked rn to their knowledge :))


[01-Aug-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
No other MRs that need to be fired because none are in the server so it’s good


[01-Aug-20 03:05 PM] courtney#5125
i love how they JOKED about an hr spying on them, but little do they know...........


[01-Aug-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
Yep they stupid af


[01-Aug-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
I thought my acc would’ve been banned by now but because I was smart and got the gamenights and polls role I didn’t randomly have no roles so they didn’t kick me out


[01-Aug-20 03:08 PM] courtney#5125
youd think they would at least kick the people out that they didnt know, but nnnnnnoooooooooooooooopppppeeeeeee


[01-Aug-20 03:08 PM] stacey#1000
They kicked everyone random but me out


[01-Aug-20 03:08 PM] stacey#1000
Because I’m a “random lr”


[01-Aug-20 03:08 PM] courtney#5125
theyre seriously not smart


[01-Aug-20 03:08 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[01-Aug-20 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
Well, I rest my case with the cb server. Mission accomplished no other MRs or concerning people in it and I’m surviving in it still. If I get banned from it at some point which I might and if I see anything concerning I’ll bring it up. For now it’s all good. That’s all I got to say regarding it now.


[01-Aug-20 03:11 PM] courtney#5125
thank goodness. that takes care of a lot of cb problems


[01-Aug-20 03:11 PM] courtney#5125
and swans been telling seniors when cbs are in their server, so thats really helpful


[01-Aug-20 03:11 PM] courtney#5125
bc all the cbs start talking about what their username is and bla bla bla so she just sends that soooooo thats nice


[01-Aug-20 03:12 PM] stacey#1000
That’s good


[01-Aug-20 03:13 PM] courtney#5125
why does it feel like omer makes it a point to ask 5-10 minutes after the asking time begins


[01-Aug-20 03:14 PM] courtney#5125
seniors would ask me to host at (for example) 5:30 and hes always asking at like 5:08 every single session


[01-Aug-20 03:14 PM] courtney#5125
*48

[01-Aug-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
Tbh we could maybe blacklist gotmestartcd


[01-Aug-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
Not sure


[01-Aug-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
She’s still involved with cbs and trash talking daily


[01-Aug-20 03:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
Someone mentioned gotme was at the hotel today and was talking abt her firing


[01-Aug-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
She made a tea doc


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Not sure the full ins and outs tho


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
So let’s blacklist her


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
She’s a threat to get a job again


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
Xxmewtimes actually left the cb server and stopped


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
Gotmestartcd continues


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Blacklist


[01-Aug-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney she’s at your int rn blacklist ban her


[01-Aug-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
Can’t let her get a job again


[01-Aug-20 03:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ye


[01-Aug-20 03:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
She shady


[01-Aug-20 03:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
I always thought she was a male oops


[01-Aug-20 03:22 PM] courtney#5125
blacklist gotmestartcd?


[01-Aug-20 03:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ye


[01-Aug-20 03:24 PM] courtney#5125
alrr ill do that now


[01-Aug-20 03:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yay


[01-Aug-20 03:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok bye guys, back to eating my chips 😌


[01-Aug-20 03:25 PM] courtney#5125
bye min!


[01-Aug-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
I mean xxmewtimes actually learned his lesson and left the cb server and stopped being involved with them after he was fired and got a job again not hating on the group. Gotmestartcd makes a tea doc, stays in the cb server and trash talks and really expects to get a job again 💀

if theyre not willing to wait 5 months to appeal, then they CLEARLY never wanted to appeal that badly in the first place


[01-Aug-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
She was in the CB server before but got banned


[01-Aug-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
I guess I’m worried about story now


[01-Aug-20 03:40 PM] courtney#5125
well dang

yikesssssssssssss


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
“Tell Diego he’s my fav”


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
She was invited to the cb server before


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
And got banned from it


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
And didn’t say anything in it really


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
But she still joined it


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] courtney#5125
dang


[01-Aug-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
Yep ok I’m announcing this


[01-Aug-20 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
Gotta keep an eye on story and bman now


[01-Aug-20 03:42 PM] courtney#5125
being in it is bad enough


[01-Aug-20 03:42 PM] courtney#5125
yeah theyreeeeeeee justtttttt


[01-Aug-20 03:42 PM] courtney#5125
eek


[01-Aug-20 03:46 PM] courtney#5125
was a card made for gotmestartcd when she got fired?


[01-Aug-20 03:46 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[01-Aug-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
@anna


[01-Aug-20 03:47 PM] courtney#5125

That’s good enough


[01-Aug-20 03:49 PM] anna#0004
oh i completely forgot to add her card for fired, sorry!


[01-Aug-20 03:49 PM] stacey#1000
It’s all good she’s getting a blacklist card made now anyways


[01-Aug-20 03:49 PM] anna#0004
oh alright


[01-Aug-20 03:49 PM] stacey#1000
But let me know your thoughts on story please


[01-Aug-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
anna im disappointed you forgot.. shalissa wouldve done better 😔


[01-Aug-20 03:50 PM] courtney#5125
considering shes an honor member, idk abt her hanging with cbs so much. "honor" has a meaning to it, and shes not really holding that up


[01-Aug-20 03:50 PM] stacey#1000
She’s not exactly friends with them but should she be messaging them like that


[01-Aug-20 03:50 PM] stacey#1000
And idk why she joined the cb server in the first place


[01-Aug-20 03:51 PM] anna#0004
shhh candy! and yeah i definitely agree that we need to keep an eye on story if she's involving herself with CBs, she's an honor member for a reason so she still represents our group but it doesn't seem like it if she's talking about having a fave cb...


[01-Aug-20 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
I guess just keep an eye out and keep an eye on Bman’s attitude as well


[01-Aug-20 03:52 PM] anna#0004
if u search


[01-Aug-20 03:53 PM] anna#0004
from: bman all u see is how he talks ab being replaced


[01-Aug-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah...


[01-Aug-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
That’s concerning


[01-Aug-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
Like when you resign you shouldn’t have the mindset of being replaced


[01-Aug-20 03:53 PM] courtney#5125
he seems to have a lot of pent up anger towards things imo


[01-Aug-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
yeah.................


[01-Aug-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
Like of course there will be more HRs but it’s not based on replacements it’s based on if we need HRs or not


[01-Aug-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
when a bunch of mrs got promoted, his first thought wasnt, "oh yay, congrats to them!" it was, "ha theyre trying to replace me, as if"


[01-Aug-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
like uhhhhhhhhhhh


[01-Aug-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
Bman is just concerning


[01-Aug-20 03:54 PM] anna#0004
obviously it wouldnt be nice seeing someone fill in ur space, but he made the choice to resign and its **not** about replacing him it's about doing what's best for the group and as a former HR, you'd expect him to understand that


[01-Aug-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
I mean he had attitude when he was an hr but not this bad


[01-Aug-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
It got worse when he resigned


[01-Aug-20 03:55 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, he chose to resign and he said his goodbye to the group. he shouldnt be angry that we still need to function without him


[01-Aug-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
He can’t get mad at every promotion


[01-Aug-20 03:55 PM] anna#0004
he probably just misses being in on everything


[01-Aug-20 03:55 PM] courtney#5125
just because we need some new mrs and we need a press conference doesnt mean its even remotely about him, necessarily


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i get he might be missing out on things, but that doesnt serve him any right to pretty much make ppl feel bad for being promoted


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
When we do get a new hr he is going to say it’s his replacement instead of saying congrats


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] anna#0004
yes if he was still an HR, those lrs/mrs wouldve still been promoted


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] courtney#5125
i feel bad for whoever that new hr is, having to deal with him ://


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
Same


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] anna#0004
ikr


[01-Aug-20 03:56 PM] courtney#5125
yes anna... like he was an hr and he was important, yes. but the group still needs to run without him and it doesnt revolve around former hrs


[01-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
It’s disappointing he’s acting this way


[01-Aug-20 03:57 PM] anna#0004
mhm, but no hate to bman obviously he was a great hr, i just wish he'd act more positive rather than making everything we do about him


[01-Aug-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
Like yes I would consider him a friend of mine but now that I’m seeing this attitude from him more it’s disappointing


[01-Aug-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
He was a good hr


[01-Aug-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
I just hope he changes his attitude


[01-Aug-20 03:58 PM] anna#0004
hes brave i could never act like that in public


[01-Aug-20 03:59 PM] courtney#5125
yeah he was a great hr and all, but doesnt give him a right to be so negative and self-centered about every decision we make


[01-Aug-20 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[01-Aug-20 04:11 PM] stacey#1000

[01-Aug-20 05:03 PM] anna#0004

[01-Aug-20 05:03 PM] Cam#5887
im really mad by that


[01-Aug-20 05:03 PM] courtney#5125

[01-Aug-20 05:03 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 05:03 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 05:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[01-Aug-20 05:08 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Aug-20 05:08 PM] courtney#5125

What do you guys think of MR of the month?


[01-Aug-20 05:45 PM] courtney#5125
ive never been a fan of it in other groups, its just a big popularity contest, it has nothing to do with whos working the hardest and putting the most dedication into the group each month


[01-Aug-20 06:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
i agree


[01-Aug-20 06:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
bad idea


[01-Aug-20 06:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
popularity contest and drama waiting to happen


[01-Aug-20 06:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
picking favorites is always a bad idea


[01-Aug-20 06:14 PM] Polk#1596
we kind of already do that with the awards like "best mr overall"


[01-Aug-20 06:14 PM] Polk#1596
i think thats enough


[01-Aug-20 06:16 PM] katie#0200
agreed


[01-Aug-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney there’s a way to see if someone is in a server if their joins are off and they are in a server. I have it on my pc you just search their username and it shows what server they are on. It’s an extension from google


[01-Aug-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
Called roblox uh I forget


[01-Aug-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
But if you need help finding what server she’s in I got you


[01-Aug-20 06:29 PM] courtney#5125
omg thats so neat


[01-Aug-20 06:29 PM] courtney#5125
is she even at training rn tho?


[01-Aug-20 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
Im not at my pc to check


[01-Aug-20 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
Is she online


[01-Aug-20 06:30 PM] courtney#5125
shes online and in a game rn


[01-Aug-20 06:30 PM] courtney#5125
i just cant see which, obviously D:


[01-Aug-20 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll check as soon as I get home


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
Wait I’ll find the name of the extension


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
So you can get it


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] courtney#5125
alright, ty!!


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
It’s called


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
RoSearcher


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
Go to the google chrome store search that


[01-Aug-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
Add the extension


[01-Aug-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
Then when you click servers type in her username and click search


[01-Aug-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
Do it for the hotel and trainings


[01-Aug-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
I  used that to see what server Abbqyx was on to promote her


[01-Aug-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney let me know if you find it


[01-Aug-20 06:35 PM] stacey#1000

[01-Aug-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
Was she at trainings?


[01-Aug-20 06:36 PM] courtney#5125
nope 😔


[01-Aug-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
Hotel?


[01-Aug-20 06:37 PM] courtney#5125
not there either ahhh


[01-Aug-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
Do you want to promote her tonight?


[01-Aug-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
I got an idea to wake her up if so


[01-Aug-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
But it would be a discord promotion


[01-Aug-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
It’s what I did to promote mia to management recently


[01-Aug-20 06:38 PM] courtney#5125
i have a bonfire at 8 pm anyways, in abt an hour, so i might as well wait until tomorrow!!


[01-Aug-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
Oki


[01-Aug-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
That extension will help you out


[01-Aug-20 06:38 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, it will! :D


[01-Aug-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
It’s legit the best extension ever


[01-Aug-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
I get annoyed when people have their joins off and I want to try to find them to promote them. That bypasses it.


[01-Aug-20 06:39 PM] courtney#5125
Yeah, it seems very very helpful


[01-Aug-20 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
People use it to stalk YouTubers


[01-Aug-20 06:40 PM] stacey#1000

[01-Aug-20 07:00 PM] Cam#5887
@stacey


[01-Aug-20 07:00 PM] Cam#5887
what is rosearcher


[01-Aug-20 07:00 PM] Cam#5887
like what does it make easier


[01-Aug-20 07:04 PM] Cam#5887
ill get it anyway!


[01-Aug-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
it makes it easier to search for a player in a server. Like say you want to promote someone and their joins are off, if you think they are at trainings for example, you click username thing and type in username, than search and it shows you what server they are on if they are on  a server @Cam


[01-Aug-20 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
if you downloaded it, click on any game, click servers, and you should see the search option there now


[01-Aug-20 07:11 PM] Cam#5887
bet thankss

but she was bad


[01-Aug-20 07:17 PM] courtney#5125
thats true'


[01-Aug-20 07:17 PM] courtney#5125
alr


[01-Aug-20 07:17 PM] courtney#5125
ty!


[01-Aug-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
she hasnt done anything for over 5 months


[01-Aug-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
she meets the requirements to send in an appeal


[01-Aug-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
doesnt mean we have to accept it but we cant deny her the chance to appeal


[01-Aug-20 07:23 PM] courtney#5125
oh yeah truee.....................................!!!


[01-Aug-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
its been over 5 months, she hasnt trolled, just because a year ago she was bad doesnt mean she is now


[01-Aug-20 07:23 PM] courtney#5125
alright, yeah, thank u!!!


[01-Aug-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
have to give her that chance


[01-Aug-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
I already gave approval she could appeal as well since she met the requirements to send in one but said no promises to it being accepting


[01-Aug-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
accepted*


[01-Aug-20 07:24 PM] courtney#5125
ok got it!


[01-Aug-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
Read the date wrong on her card she was last banned, which was March 31st.


[01-Aug-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
She needs to wait another month then its the 5 month mark.


[01-Aug-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
So she cannot appeal until September


[01-Aug-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
She doesnt trash talk in the CB server as far as Im aware.


[01-Aug-20 07:26 PM] courtney#5125
o


[01-Aug-20 07:27 PM] stacey#1000
So if she still hasnt in September, she can appeal then.


[01-Aug-20 07:28 PM] courtney#5125
alright, thanks again!


[01-Aug-20 07:28 PM] stacey#1000

wth Mack-


[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000

[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
But yes he shouldn’t have said that


[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] courtney#5125
but it’s still an odd thing to say


[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] courtney#5125
yaaa..


[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
Tell me 1 good reason why I shouldn’t write a doc to these cbs and send it in their general chat then leave


[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] anna#0004
and the cbs tried to appeal...


[02-Aug-20 06:46 PM] anna#0004
theres legit no way


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] courtney#5125
can we just never let rack appeal omg


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] courtney#5125
unbelievable


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
She will never appeal


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
Neither will anyone in that sever


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
Server


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] anna#0004
cant believe she even had the audacity to try and appeal


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] courtney#5125
exactly....


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
Legit it’s hard not to say anything to them rn


[02-Aug-20 06:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
the familiar phrases i hate the most appear when people resign
"place will hit rock bottom soon"
"i want hilton again"
"where are all the good HRs? Gone."


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] anna#0004
ikr


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
resigning means hes moving on


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats not something that shows we're going "downhill"


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] stacey#1000
He couldn’t deal with the hate anymore


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] courtney#5125
it doesn’t mean he hates anyone or the group, he’s just content with everything he’s done at bh likeeee


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] anna#0004
it was barely even his own choice which is the saddest part


[02-Aug-20 06:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
these ppl act like we just shutdown


[02-Aug-20 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
It’s a bad idea for me to say anything to the cbs they won’t care. They just piss me off


[02-Aug-20 06:50 PM] anna#0004
yeah theyre being really annoying and stupid rn, but dont say anything they wont listen or care like u said


[02-Aug-20 06:50 PM] stacey#1000
Do I really have to stay in their server on my alt still is what I’m asking


[02-Aug-20 06:50 PM] stacey#1000
I can’t stand reading their trash talk messages and not being able to say anything back


[02-Aug-20 06:51 PM] stacey#1000
Yes I got 2 MRs fired for it and it’s good for that but really idk how much longer I can take reading this shit


[02-Aug-20 06:51 PM] anna#0004
if its too much for u, dont feel obligated to stay though it can be really useful, but they r rude and its understandable if u dont feel like u can stay in it


[02-Aug-20 06:51 PM] stacey#1000
Sorry I curse when I’m mad. I rarely curse


[02-Aug-20 06:52 PM] Polk#1596

[02-Aug-20 06:53 PM] courtney#5125
yes bman has been worse and it’s been continuous


[02-Aug-20 06:53 PM] anna#0004
so


[02-Aug-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
His is worse


[02-Aug-20 06:53 PM] Polk#1596
they are still kind of representing us since we treat them with such a special rank, then they just completely make fun of us


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
Bmans attitude was bad


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] courtney#5125
honor has a meaning to it, they’re not holding up the status very well


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Honestly ^^


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] Polk#1596
cam is the only person that resigned recently that deserves his honor member role


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] katie#0200
Their ego just goes through the roof once they resign, they think nothing can happen to them anymore and it’s so disappointing to see them like this


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Oh did you guys see dis


[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] Polk#1596
baby bear, if u wanna remove their ranks we are in favor for it

[02-Aug-20 06:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and then when their honor gets taken they're like "i did nothing blah blah blah"


[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] courtney#5125

[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] Polk#1596

[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] anna#0004
what the heck


[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
Bmans attitude rn is “who is my replacement”


[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
we're hiring 2


[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
so


[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] courtney#5125
yeah it’s so annoying considering the public usually doesn’t know why it’s taken, so they get everyone else on their side to hate on us for taking it....


[02-Aug-20 06:55 PM] bonnie591#0591

[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Some of these honors.. *cough bman and mack*.. need to start reconsidering why they're still in the bloxton discord


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
I know I shouldn’t bring this up maybe it’s a bad time. But who wants to own the information board now and do that


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] ethan;#0003
mack hasnt said nearly as many bad things as bman


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
I say we remove their roles and ban, especially bman; I've seen enough of Bman he's just turned toxic


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Omg I can't stay in this vc. I'm going to cry.


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I knew he had an attitude


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah bmans has just gotten WAYYY worse


[02-Aug-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
But it got worse when he resigned


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
He's become sour now


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
extremely sour


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
Bman resigned and turned like the people he once used to ban when he was an HR


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ever since the reforms his attitude has just gotten worse and worse


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's rlly a shame


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
:/


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
Like at first I thought it was only for a limited time when he was upset with things in the past and would move on but it got worse


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
So yeah


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
i think it comes more of


[02-Aug-20 07:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
bman being ungrateful


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
hes complaining that he's next to "admins"


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
with his honor


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
He's like got this entitlement


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Tattoblue


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
he also gets mad when people dont say "hi" to him like they did when he was an HR


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
yikes


[02-Aug-20 07:06 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@bonnie591 wat


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] stacey#1000
I mean idk what he expected when he resigned


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
true


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
you have to watch out guys as an HR


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
people act friendly toward you but remember your status means they might be fake


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
i have to watch out as well


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
people do it all the time to us


[02-Aug-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
we gotta stick together


[02-Aug-20 07:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Oh yeah, some people out there are only acting friendly for promotions and stuff, it's really something you have to be aware of as an HR


[02-Aug-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll just say if any person tries to dox me and cyber bully I go straight to the authorities


[02-Aug-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
And yes fake people use you for your rank

[02-Aug-20 07:19 PM] xM_inn#2821

[02-Aug-20 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
I hate people did this to him to cause him to leave. They really don’t think about their actions and how it effects others.


[02-Aug-20 07:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
so ready to move past 2020


[02-Aug-20 07:20 PM] katie#0200
Agreed

[02-Aug-20 07:20 PM] katie#0200
Can 2020 be over already pls


[02-Aug-20 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
2020 is a sad year


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
right


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
2020 sucks booty


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Well, I've gotta eat! We'll get back here and then remove the honor most likely..


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Racks comments were so insensitive.


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It was just disgusting.


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] stacey#1000
It’s hard for me not to say anything to them honestly


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah, I saw parts of it, it's so terrible.


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] stacey#1000
If I do I get my alt acc kicked out and I get no more info so


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] Polk#1596
yeah, cam leaving is a big hit for us


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
2020 was bad from the start, ww3 was a threat from the word go


[02-Aug-20 07:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
We've gotta be the better person though, best to not say anything to that youtuber.


[02-Aug-20 07:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I just reported the video and closed the tab.


[02-Aug-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
Saying anything to them will give them the attention they want.


[02-Aug-20 07:22 PM] katie#0200
Mhm, we don’t want to start something bigger with people who want nothing but to ruin our reputation


[02-Aug-20 07:22 PM] courtney#5125
@bonnie591 she wasnt at training today but ill try to catch her tomorrow!


[02-Aug-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
The only thing that could really be done is reporting them for Cyberbullying but that’s up to cam.


[02-Aug-20 07:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Now some good things has happened in 2020 like me going to new york (even though bman was there too and i went in a shop 6 hours after him YUCK) and also this lockdown really given me a break but everything else like cancelled vacations and being able to go on day trips irl and getting to experience more stuff has just been completely rubbish


[02-Aug-20 07:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
i thought 2019 was a bad year but boy i loved 2019 now i think about it


[02-Aug-20 07:23 PM] bonnie591#0591

[02-Aug-20 07:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053

and then then i got the 8


[02-Aug-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
I never usually get the newest phone but since I had my own money for it I decided why not this time and now I don’t need a new phone for years


[02-Aug-20 07:26 PM] katie#0200

[02-Aug-20 07:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
Very early 2018 though


[02-Aug-20 07:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think it was just before I got Head Recep


[02-Aug-20 07:39 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I did an interview recently!! So now I am finishing it with a training!


[02-Aug-20 07:39 PM] xM_inn#2821

@babymariobebe HOLD ON TAKING AWAY BMANS HONOR


[02-Aug-20 07:39 PM] impact#0297
HOLD


[02-Aug-20 07:39 PM] xM_inn#2821

hi minn


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@impact What's up?


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
what's up with bman


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] impact#0297
just hold


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] impact#0297
give it 15 minutes


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Why's that?


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] impact#0297
just timing


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
For what?


[02-Aug-20 07:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I was about to remove both


[02-Aug-20 07:41 PM] impact#0297
you can remove mack he's not a threat to BH anymore


[02-Aug-20 07:41 PM] impact#0297
just hold on Bman


[02-Aug-20 07:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
nor is Bman?


[02-Aug-20 07:41 PM] impact#0297
i beg to differ


[02-Aug-20 07:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@impact Explain in DMs, I want to understand your reasoning


[02-Aug-20 07:42 PM] impact#0297
I'll explain it here for everyone to see.


[02-Aug-20 07:42 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Alright, whatever works for you


[02-Aug-20 07:42 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I don't see him as a threat though


[02-Aug-20 07:42 PM] impact#0297
I have no problems getting rid of Bman's honor member. I really don't. 

However, we need to look at the optics of this. If we remove Bman's honor and our reasoning is because ...?


[02-Aug-20 07:43 PM] impact#0297
Cause if Bman blows it up that we removed his honor member for no good reason, people will look back on his chat history and think the stuff he is spewing is true


[02-Aug-20 07:43 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Have you seen his messages? We can remove honor for whatever we deem is not 'honorable'


[02-Aug-20 07:43 PM] impact#0297
We have some pretty good sentiment right now towards us (high ranks) -- because we accepted the appeals of Trey and Emma.


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
we aren't going to defend the actions of a hater


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
all for the sake of good press


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
Do we really want to cost us sentiment over some guy who keeps spewing shit in general discussion?


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The reason is the fact that we dislike what he says toward the group. Everyone voted for his removal.


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yes, it isn't honorable, and I can't sit here and let him continue when we believe it is not honorable.


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
by keeping it your saying "keep spewing more crap about our group! i love it!"


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] babymariobebe#7563
^


[02-Aug-20 07:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
think bout it


[02-Aug-20 07:45 PM] impact#0297
He wants fucking attention. He gets that when we remove his honor status.


[02-Aug-20 07:45 PM] impact#0297
That's all I'm gonna say.


[02-Aug-20 07:45 PM] impact#0297
We will fill his dopamine rush this Sunday evening


[02-Aug-20 07:45 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The honor status gives him attention anyway, not like its good either way and we can't let him continue


[02-Aug-20 07:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
plus if anything give it a day or two and they will be quiet


[02-Aug-20 07:46 PM] impact#0297
What is the exact reason for his honor being taken away?


[02-Aug-20 07:46 PM] impact#0297
Plain english.


[02-Aug-20 07:46 PM] impact#0297
One sentence.


[02-Aug-20 07:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
Bman is ungrateful for what he's received, complains, and bad mouths any actions we take.


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Disrespect toward the group, toxicity, constant unfounded complaints, just here to cause drama. Check his chat logs. Nothing he does is honorable toward the group.


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
Influencing and causing drama by discussing sensitive topics, toxicity, and generating an unpleasant atmosphere in the Discord server.

Isn't that a good enough reason?


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] ethan;#0003
people cant look back at his chat messages if he is banned


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] babymariobebe#7563
^^


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
and its shown through his comments made i n#genera


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] impact#0297
Ok, so, let's put a rule number to that.


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] impact#0297
What rule # is he breaking?


[02-Aug-20 07:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'd say the following rules:


[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
20. Be respectful and polite. Disagreement and constructive criticism are welcome, but rude behavior is not. Inconsiderate, insulting, derogatory, and toxic behavior is not allowed. This extends to nicknames (Eg. do not impersonate users), and discussion about external content, such as forum posts (Eg. do not make fun of people).


[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
5. Try not to cause any drama or arguments.

3. You are required to treat all server members with respect. Discrimination against race, gender, appearance, or sexual orientation is not tolerated.

[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
quite a lot


[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
That's 3 rule violations


[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] impact#0297
Sounds good. Just expect him to be worse tonight.


[02-Aug-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
we are well prepared


[02-Aug-20 07:49 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Then if that's the case, it will be followed with a ban, for the same violations.


[02-Aug-20 07:49 PM] babymariobebe#7563
His choice.


[02-Aug-20 07:49 PM] impact#0297
Let's get to work on new Shift Managers.


[02-Aug-20 07:49 PM] impact#0297
Fraux being promoted would be a fucking godsend


[02-Aug-20 07:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
He wins if we take his honour role, he wins if he keeps his honour role. Either way he gets attention. I do personally think it'd be within our best interests to remove his role and ban though.


[02-Aug-20 07:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes fraux ftw


[02-Aug-20 07:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
we already got a vote up cyto


[02-Aug-20 07:50 PM] babymariobebe#7563

Thank you, seriously. Thank you for listening to the High Rank team. It means a lot @babymariobebe


[02-Aug-20 07:50 PM] impact#0297

[02-Aug-20 07:50 PM] xM_inn#2821

[02-Aug-20 07:50 PM] xM_inn#2821

[02-Aug-20 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
I won’t lie I use to be good friends with bman and was able to discuss things with him when he was an HR but I noticed his attitude was going downhill the past month.


[02-Aug-20 08:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
I'm thinking of giving perks and we'll be adding benefits and bonuses at the hotel, etc. If you have any ideas for Honor member perks, forward it to me as i'm still in the planning process. 😃

Add a slock option for honor members too pls


[02-Aug-20 08:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
- Free Access to Ocean Bungalows, Penthouses, etc

- Exclusive Interview/Training Access

- Extra Daily Bloxton Bux

- Special Chat Colour?


[02-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
Oh yes


[02-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
a slock for honor memeber


[02-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
is needed


[02-Aug-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
I have to slock 1 to let them in


[02-Aug-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
It’s annoying sometimes when they want to get into a training server and then have to do slock 1 to let them in and kick other people


[02-Aug-20 08:26 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal on the discord, the honor member role should be higher than nitro booster so everyone can see the yellow golden color of honor member for the people who boost the server and have honor member


[02-Aug-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000
You should also change the colour of the honour member role because it’s too close to the general manager role colour and other former HRs have said that as well and they get me confused thinking I resigned when I try talking in former HR chat


[02-Aug-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000

Fun story, a group he owns he free ranked me to HR because of my rank here and I didn’t do anything and quit. He ran his group like he was entitled and was like strict on everything. He was like: “host something now NOW NOW” and it was bad.


[02-Aug-20 08:37 PM] stacey#1000
Not to mention he copied Bloxton regarding ranks and board style and everything


[02-Aug-20 08:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Not very good leadership


[02-Aug-20 08:37 PM] stacey#1000

He’s probably talking to everyone about in DMs that he’s friends with


[02-Aug-20 09:44 PM] anna#0004
the way everyone immediately takes bman's side


[02-Aug-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000
He didn’t just have it taken for the Erick thing lmao


[02-Aug-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000
That’s what he’s like telling everyone


[02-Aug-20 09:47 PM] anna#0004

[02-Aug-20 09:47 PM] Tattoblue#5828

They want to be banned rn


[02-Aug-20 09:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Don’t give them what they want


[02-Aug-20 09:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But they definitely are causing a ton of shit


[02-Aug-20 09:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
give it more time ya


[02-Aug-20 09:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
they won't be quiet and we'll have plenty of screnshots lol


[02-Aug-20 09:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
he said he doesn't care for his honor so why is he still talking


[02-Aug-20 09:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
honestlyyy


[02-Aug-20 09:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Because he wants to cause the drama


[02-Aug-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
what's stopping us from just outright banning all minivan people


[02-Aug-20 09:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bias


[02-Aug-20 09:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That’s what


[02-Aug-20 09:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They’ll know


[02-Aug-20 09:56 PM] impact#0297
Good, glad they know. What's are the negative consequences for us?


[02-Aug-20 09:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They are gonna paint it as if we are censoring their opinions


[02-Aug-20 09:56 PM] Tattoblue#5828
They wont be able to paint it in as much places if we ban em


[02-Aug-20 09:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And then cause more drama


[02-Aug-20 09:57 PM] Tattoblue#5828
but if we keep em they can just stir shit up in general chat


[02-Aug-20 09:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ik ik


[02-Aug-20 09:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It’s a lose lose tbh


[02-Aug-20 09:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But imo just banning them all sends the wrong message in this situation


[02-Aug-20 09:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Wtf is this VC y’all are in


[02-Aug-20 09:58 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I think its just a joke @RAMMGaming


[02-Aug-20 09:58 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[02-Aug-20 09:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
saab says @impact it looks unprofessional of u to post bman screnshots in general just to let u know


[02-Aug-20 10:00 PM] impact#0297
No problem.


[02-Aug-20 10:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
idc if u post screnshots but just saying some ppl noticed it


[02-Aug-20 10:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[02-Aug-20 10:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Going to wait until this all blows over so certain people don't say its cam's "replacement"


[02-Aug-20 10:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Makes sense. 👍


[02-Aug-20 10:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563

One cb is selling an acc to another cb and I’ll make sure they never get promoted like they want

Message from cam: he is coming back on an alt account as a staff member so he won't be harassed from users, as he still gets harassed even when he goes to the hotel still. This is his staff account https://www.roblox.com/users/1802666065/profile

@Tattoblue that isn’t trash talking


[04-Aug-20 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
They are just saying they want Aidvan to be promoted


[04-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
and then they are complaining there are 10 heads already in infs


[04-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
Ones


[04-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003

[04-Aug-20 08:26 PM] ethan;#0003
Wait idk what they are saying


[04-Aug-20 08:26 PM] ethan;#0003
about Aidan


[04-Aug-20 08:26 PM] ethan;#0003
What Aidan it is


[04-Aug-20 08:26 PM] courtney#5125
it doesnt really look like trash-talking


[04-Aug-20 08:26 PM] courtney#5125
theyre saying that aivdan got promoted, and they all seemed to think it was aidannnx


[04-Aug-20 08:27 PM] courtney#5125
so they  said aidannnx deserved it and they wanted him to be promoted, but they also ended up saying that aivdan deserved it too


[04-Aug-20 08:28 PM] courtney#5125
and it doesnt seem too bad when theyre talking abt being over the mr limit. they seem to point specific heads out that arent following it, but they dont really trash-talk those heads


[04-Aug-20 08:29 PM] courtney#5125
the way they responded to how those heads were over the mr limit probably wasnt the kindest, considering they were calling them curse words, but it doesnt seem all thaaaaaaaaat bad


[04-Aug-20 08:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
where did they even say that in, was it there own group chat


[04-Aug-20 08:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[04-Aug-20 08:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I agree with u candy, I don’t think there was a reason to use profanity like that


[04-Aug-20 08:31 PM] Tattoblue#5828
but ye @courtney


[04-Aug-20 08:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who reported it


[04-Aug-20 08:32 PM] courtney#5125
calling them "bitches" and "fuckers" totally wasnt necessary, but it doesnt seem like they meant serious harm by it, it looks like they were just a little.... bothered? by the fact that other heads were going over the limit


[04-Aug-20 08:33 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Bloo_Berriez mia and eri


[04-Aug-20 08:33 PM] courtney#5125
who all was really talking the worst


[04-Aug-20 08:34 PM] courtney#5125
rnadds and r4ses?


[04-Aug-20 08:34 PM] courtney#5125
kylieenoir didnt seem to say much other than state optimistic went over the limit


[04-Aug-20 08:34 PM] courtney#5125
roxieisog seems to just say that someone was promoted and that it was aivdan, not aidannnx


[04-Aug-20 08:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
assuming it was their own little group chat, do we take action on things like this if it’s there group chat. of course it would be different story if this was said on the discord lol


[04-Aug-20 08:38 PM] Tattoblue#5828
They claim they had another group chat but they deleted it  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  i think  if there was more proof then maybe but there isnt a lot so @Bloo_Berriez


[04-Aug-20 08:38 PM] courtney#5125
considering what they said wasnt all TOO bad


[04-Aug-20 08:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmmm yeah. IF anything, the most I would consider is a warning, probably verbal but I forgot what our policy was on like side group chats, and incidents like these.


[04-Aug-20 08:41 PM] courtney#5125
verbal warnings for who, tho?


[04-Aug-20 08:41 PM] courtney#5125
mel and mads were the worst, at least thats what it looks like to me


[04-Aug-20 08:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh wow u noob u deleted it @Tattoblue


[04-Aug-20 08:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
shh


[04-Aug-20 08:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[07-Aug-20 12:00 PM] Polk#1596
we make it clear that professionalism and grammar is a must when visiting allies


[07-Aug-20 12:01 PM] Polk#1596
but go question anyway, these pictures don't tell us everything


[07-Aug-20 12:01 PM] Tattoblue#5828
We suspend LRs for doing similar things so ye not much leeway here


[07-Aug-20 12:03 PM] Polk#1596
if the screenshots are real and she has no excuses


[07-Aug-20 12:03 PM] Polk#1596
i'd say a medium suspension


[07-Aug-20 12:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
Grammar is only required when in uniform tho


[07-Aug-20 12:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
Which we cant prove rn unless she confesses when questioning


[07-Aug-20 12:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
So we'll see what she says shortly


[07-Aug-20 12:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Suspend while pending investigation? Y/N. I personally say no as she doesn't hold a massive threat being questioned while not suspended.


[07-Aug-20 12:08 PM] Polk#1596
since when was that a rule


[07-Aug-20 12:08 PM] Polk#1596
you still represent bloxton everywhere you go, regardless of wearing the uniform


[07-Aug-20 12:09 PM] Polk#1596
if that is a thing the mrs should be informed about it, because personally i have always enforced the rule "act professional at allies at all times"


[07-Aug-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Professionalism and not using grammar are different things


[07-Aug-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes they must act professional


[07-Aug-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
No they don't have to use grammar when not in uniform


[07-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
min


[07-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
all my time of being at bloxton


[07-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
we have always told mrs to use grammar at allies


[07-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
when did that change?


[07-Aug-20 12:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's always been like that as far as I'm aware


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
well no


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
we didnt get MR uniforms until like


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
late 2018 right?


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
If u want to change it again that's fine but we can't control them all the time, they need space


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
they had to use grammar at allies


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
That was before uniforms


[07-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
thats not what im saying, im asking when this new regulation was introduced


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Polk#1596
because from looking at staff announcements, it hasnt been mentioned


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well I assume after the uniforms were implemented


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Polk#1596
they might not be informed about it either


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Polk#1596
hm


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
wait hold on


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
HOLD ON


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
im um


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
getting confused with sizzleburger


[07-Aug-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
FORGET EVERYTHING I SAID


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
personally i dont mind if they *dont* have to use grammar at allies while not wearing the uniform, but i think we should ask baby and bear first


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
omg -_-


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
well tbh

LOL


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
its not the dumbest rule


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
sizzleburger has that as a rule


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
soo i got confused!


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
but honestly im really scared about how we treat allies


[07-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Polk#1596
thats why i think "always use grammar"


[07-Aug-20 12:14 PM] Polk#1596
min


[07-Aug-20 12:14 PM] Polk#1596

idk if it was u, but since it was ur cards i will assume it was


[07-Aug-20 12:44 PM] Polk#1596
remember not to add the "promote" label on ur promotion suggestion card until a bod approves and sets a due date! @stacey


[07-Aug-20 12:44 PM] Polk#1596
remember that you cannot approve promotion suggestions by yourself, only bods can set due date and add the "promote" label @courtney


[07-Aug-20 12:45 PM] Polk#1596
well if u realize that it has 5 votes and no bod has checked it yet, u can ping us


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn I think the entire or most of the manager board needs to be redone


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes its old


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
needs a refresh


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
we can work on that


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] ethan;#0003
It’s all from before discord times


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@xM_inn maybe we can add a manager only FAQ channel in da discord to replace it idk


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah i was about to say that


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
boomer management board


[07-Aug-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
we use discord for most stuff now


[07-Aug-20 01:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmmm idk its kinda pointless cuz managers can just dm hrs with questions they dont know


[07-Aug-20 01:22 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeh tru


[07-Aug-20 02:59 PM] courtney#5125

[07-Aug-20 05:14 PM] ethan;#0003

[07-Aug-20 05:14 PM] ethan;#0003
He got it removed


[07-Aug-20 05:14 PM] ethan;#0003
A few months ago


[07-Aug-20 05:14 PM] ethan;#0003
I don’t remember why


[07-Aug-20 05:16 PM] courtney#5125
well his appeal was accepted on june 16th, but he doesnt currently have it rn https://discord.com/channels/325865347045523456/698763137607925855/722569287302381679


[07-Aug-20 05:16 PM] courtney#5125
did he do something since thennn?


[07-Aug-20 05:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@courtney he doesn’t have it currently cuz he got kicked from the server


[07-Aug-20 05:16 PM] courtney#5125
ah


[07-Aug-20 05:16 PM] courtney#5125

[07-Aug-20 05:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Idk, min tagged about it a couple weeks ago but nothing was decided


[07-Aug-20 05:17 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, and luckys original ticket was closed when he asked for it but idk why


[07-Aug-20 05:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@courtney id say set up a vote in #hr-announcements


[07-Aug-20 05:24 PM] katie#0200
Didn’t lucky lose it like really recently


[07-Aug-20 05:24 PM] courtney#5125
he spammed in the discord and got kicked for it, but idk if we decided to remove his former role for it or not


[07-Aug-20 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
@impact Is there a meeting tomorrow?


[07-Aug-20 05:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@courtney no he can’t get it back until bear gives the ok


[07-Aug-20 05:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He was causing drama and was kicked for making the whole server spam after Bear and I asked him to stop


[07-Aug-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125
ah got it


[07-Aug-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125

[07-Aug-20 06:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
i can only vc from around 1am onwards


[07-Aug-20 06:20 PM] bonnie591#0591

[07-Aug-20 06:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
is it possible to do the press conference sunday or something or after we do rules tomorrow


[07-Aug-20 06:21 PM] impact#0297
ask fraux and emily if they want to be promoted by someone specific


[07-Aug-20 06:22 PM] impact#0297
why can't you call them tonight?


[07-Aug-20 06:22 PM] impact#0297
isn't 1am onwards for BST pretty soon here


[07-Aug-20 06:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah but katie was supposed to do her supervised shift promotion for these promotions as well and will be doing the vc with me as a trial. she is also making a document for emi/fraux that contains all the information as well for after the vc


[07-Aug-20 06:23 PM] stacey#1000

[07-Aug-20 06:25 PM] impact#0297
I would like to make a big announcement. Fraux is extremely popular.


[07-Aug-20 06:25 PM] impact#0297

[07-Aug-20 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
what we could do is


[07-Aug-20 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
after me and katie do the rules


[07-Aug-20 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
you make an announcement saying join vc and stuff


[07-Aug-20 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
and then announce it in vc


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] impact#0297
why are we drafting a document for fraux and emily straight out of thin air


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] impact#0297
don't we have a document for hr's already


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
nope


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] impact#0297
how did we onboard people then


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
we usually do our promotions via gc in text


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
and explain the rules so they can go back to them


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] katie#0200
It’s just because we’re doing it over vc and they might need to read over some stuff again


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] impact#0297
can you give them the rules without the document


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
it was explained via messages, however this time bonnie wants to do it in vc, so the document would contain everything discussed in vc to lookback on and help them with in case they forget


[07-Aug-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
unless they record our voices which i wont be comfortable with then they cant go back and see


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] impact#0297
fraux knows the rules honestly


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] impact#0297
not sure about emily


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
fraux knows the rules?


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] impact#0297
fraux could be your dad


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
so he knows all about our hr board, alliance board, pay, training board


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
brief everyone as normal still tho @impact


[07-Aug-20 06:27 PM] impact#0297
yea yea i know but I don't get this document bit


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] impact#0297
like I get it you have to draft it


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] impact#0297
but like I thought we already had a document for this


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
nope


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
some people have guides to promote people to shift via text


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] impact#0297
how fast can you draft that document


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yay hype new SM


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
but we're making it into a google document for them which explains everyone instead of just a guide


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
im guessing katie will do it when she gets home as shes the one doing it


[07-Aug-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
@katie


[07-Aug-20 06:29 PM] impact#0297
cause if I move a press conference to sunday and we still don't have a document I won't be a happy camper


[07-Aug-20 06:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
The sooner the better tbh


[07-Aug-20 06:29 PM] impact#0297
sundays are for the lord


[07-Aug-20 06:29 PM] katie#0200
Yeah I’ve been working on it, I’ll try and get it complete ASAP


[07-Aug-20 06:30 PM] impact#0297
Give me an update in 5 hours.


[07-Aug-20 06:30 PM] katie#0200
I’ll be sleeping


[07-Aug-20 06:30 PM] impact#0297
3 hours.


[07-Aug-20 06:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
do we need to do it via press conference vc or can we just do a fancy announcement like we did with reforms


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] impact#0297
both


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] impact#0297
hiring shift managers is free positivity


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] impact#0297
plus, it will be interesting to see bman throw a tantrum


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] ethan;#0003
is there a meeting tommmorow


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] impact#0297
yes


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh the best thing is we are hiring emi and bman didnt like emi


[07-Aug-20 06:31 PM] ethan;#0003
I might not be able to make it


[07-Aug-20 06:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
so i would love to see how he likes his "replacement"


[07-Aug-20 06:32 PM] impact#0297
can someone pull some fast facts on fraux and emily


[07-Aug-20 06:32 PM] ethan;#0003
I have no power and idk if I can connect to VC in my phone


[07-Aug-20 06:32 PM] impact#0297

[07-Aug-20 06:35 PM] impact#0297
That's fucking music to my ears.


[07-Aug-20 06:35 PM] impact#0297
I don't mean to be a hard ass, but this shit will probably electrify the community.


[07-Aug-20 06:36 PM] bonnie591#0591

whether its smart if we build it


[07-Aug-20 11:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
or we get someone else to


[07-Aug-20 11:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
if the answer is someone else, it likely isn't builder_boy


[07-Aug-20 11:33 PM] impact#0297
let me know if you need help there


[07-Aug-20 11:43 PM] impact#0297

[08-Aug-20 12:22 AM] Beartikal#9760

If they have timezone roles they can join the vc for it. I’ve said before idek why we still have those timezone vcs and should just remove them

I was up playing games with mrs


[08-Aug-20 12:14 PM] ethan;#0003
a way to get that up would to let seniors read talkative role tickets


[08-Aug-20 12:14 PM] ethan;#0003
without perms from an HR


[08-Aug-20 12:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
👍


[08-Aug-20 12:20 PM] courtney#5125
well i dont really see why we'd need to do slowmode


[08-Aug-20 12:20 PM] courtney#5125
ever


[08-Aug-20 12:20 PM] courtney#5125
it just gets everyone more frustrated and upset, no matter how active the chat is


[08-Aug-20 12:21 PM] katie#0200
the only time i feel slowmode is necessary is when people are like really spamming - not talking, i mean the same messages over and over again and it becomes a bit like a riot


[08-Aug-20 12:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah i think we should only use it if it's urgent and chaos is happening in general. we should definitely not turn it off after resignation or promotion announcement


[08-Aug-20 12:21 PM] courtney#5125
of course we're not trying to "silence" them, but when we limit the amount of times they can talk and how frequently they can talk feels like we don't want to hear all of the opinions and feedback


[08-Aug-20 12:22 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[08-Aug-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
No


[08-Aug-20 12:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Don't slowmode


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] ethan;#0003
no point


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] anna#0004
i dont think so


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] Polk#1596
i dont see a reason why we should


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] ethan;#0003
they arent trying to read anything in general


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] ethan;#0003
they are just ranting


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] Polk#1596
press conference yes


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
press conference or Q and A


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yes, or just make a questions channel.


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] anna#0004
yeah and like Q&A


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] Polk#1596
any events


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] courtney#5125
only during a press conference or q&a when we just need to see the questions and opinions


[08-Aug-20 12:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
^


[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] katie#0200
yeah same as the above


[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Polk#1596
that includes discord


[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Spamming is..


[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Polk#1596
spamming #JUSTICEFORCBS ?


[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Polk#1596
or something


[08-Aug-20 12:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
rule 4


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well im about to go like every saturday


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
@anna omg you should talk


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
get in the rollarcoaster


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Polk you too


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] anna#0004
no sir


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] Polk#1596
well i mean if theres a TON of rulebreakers we can temporarily put on slowmode to get rid of them, then we turn it off


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] katie#0200
in that situation i think we should, it'll help us see who needs to be warned and we'll be able to see more opinions on the matter rather than the same thing spammed over and over again


[08-Aug-20 12:25 PM] Polk#1596
but that depends on the situation


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] impact#0297
1) slowmode during press conferences
2) slowmode during times of spamming -- what is the definition of spamming? what is a good definition to activate slowmode?


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
im not gonna play shawtys during a meeting no @bonnie591


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
no talk polk


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
hm well, if theres only one major spammer then i dont think we need it. just like if we get raided


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
like multiple major spammers that completely like


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
flood the general chat


[08-Aug-20 12:26 PM] ethan;#0003
flooding the chat with repetitive messages


[08-Aug-20 12:27 PM] Polk#1596
mhm


[08-Aug-20 12:27 PM] katie#0200
yeah - if it's a group of people and the chat is being flooded then we should activate slowmode


[08-Aug-20 12:27 PM] impact#0297
1) when we find identifiable individuals who are flooding the chat with repetitive messages


[08-Aug-20 12:27 PM] katie#0200
yes


[08-Aug-20 12:27 PM] anna#0004
yeah

Trello
Organize anything, together. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, know what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.


[08-Aug-20 12:57 PM] Polk#1596
yeah he seemed impressed too


[08-Aug-20 12:57 PM] Polk#1596

[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
@impact should we invite them to this chat after rules or after promotion


[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] bonnie591#0591

[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] Polk#1596
this is not a topic, but just gonna say that the HR board will get a little makeover as well as a new list being added! it will be implemented tonight


[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
Not important but I finally got banned from the cb server after there was nothing concerning anymore about it. Job complete.


[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
It only took them 2 months to ban me


[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] courtney#5125
wooo staceyy!


[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
Because it was an alt acc


[08-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
No I never said anything


[08-Aug-20 01:00 PM] stacey#1000
They just banned everyone they didn’t know


[08-Aug-20 01:00 PM] courtney#5125
they probably just thought she was suspicious, finally


[08-Aug-20 01:00 PM] courtney#5125
took them so long tho


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 what timezone is James


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] bonnie591#0591

[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no he’s est


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
jameisnubby?


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] ethan;#0003
hes est


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah he’s est


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought that too lol


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I never see him rip


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] stacey#1000
And I’m est


[08-Aug-20 01:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but I asked him and he said est


[08-Aug-20 01:02 PM] stacey#1000
Well if I’m est and I don’t see him and my est sessions that’s concerning


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
With ticket sessions yes


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] katie#0200
Not on their own but we can host ticket sessions


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] ethan;#0003
not without an HR


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
Only if an hr is hosting


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] courtney#5125
no


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] ethan;#0003
we give them the role


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
They can’t give people roles


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] ethan;#0003
the ticket reviewing role


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
Only HRs can


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
That’s why we do ticket sessions


[08-Aug-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
So they review and the hr gives them roles


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
ig


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] katie#0200
Yeah I guess


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
If you can give people roles


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
Sure


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] ethan;#0003
alreay


[08-Aug-20 01:04 PM] anna#0004
we dont give them to staff since they have speaking permission


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] ethan;#0003
and dont need it


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
We give it to guests and trainees


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
trainees can get them too cant they?


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
oh yes


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Trainees yes


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] anna#0004
ya


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
ok i always have but JUST making sure


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Doesnt talkative have a section


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] ethan;#0003
you give the seniors the ticket role


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] ethan;#0003
and then when its done


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] katie#0200
Give them the support role


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] ethan;#0003
you remove it


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Tag seniors and those that want to give them support team


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
yeah they should ping u if they want to help out!


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Support team role gives them access to it


[08-Aug-20 01:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
old but also new to our systems


[08-Aug-20 01:06 PM] ethan;#0003
the way i do it i tell them to close the ticket if it does not meet the criteria, and if it meets the criteria to tag me


[08-Aug-20 01:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
ii love new roles


[08-Aug-20 01:06 PM] katie#0200
Yeah


[08-Aug-20 01:06 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[08-Aug-20 01:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Can we just allow them access to talkative section - and then we sort out the tickets


[08-Aug-20 01:06 PM] ethan;#0003
idk how discord roles work


[08-Aug-20 01:07 PM] stacey#1000
But we still have to give roles it would become confusing


[08-Aug-20 01:07 PM] courtney#5125
so u mean we move the tickets requesting for the talkative role into the talkative role section, then give seniors a role that allows them to just view that section?


[08-Aug-20 01:07 PM] katie#0200
Talkative tickets still come in the normal ticket inbox so idk


[08-Aug-20 01:07 PM] ethan;#0003
i went afk and someone just placed ice on a cone infront of me

HI EMILY AND FRAUX


[08-Aug-20 01:08 PM] stacey#1000
During the press conference if I see someone in the vc I wanted to promote to rank 10 can I announce it after you announce the shift promos


[08-Aug-20 01:08 PM] stacey#1000
Or no


[08-Aug-20 01:08 PM] courtney#5125
SOPHIA?


[08-Aug-20 01:08 PM] stacey#1000
Yes

:nevergonna:


[08-Aug-20 01:09 PM] stacey#1000
Or Imogen


[08-Aug-20 01:09 PM] courtney#5125
yes imogen yes yes yes


[08-Aug-20 01:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Polk what If... you talked in vc...


[08-Aug-20 01:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Haha jk


[08-Aug-20 01:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Unless?


[08-Aug-20 01:09 PM] courtney#5125
unless LMFAOOA


[08-Aug-20 01:10 PM] Polk#1596
i CAN


[08-Aug-20 01:10 PM] Polk#1596
sing a song


[08-Aug-20 01:10 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Ok dew it


[08-Aug-20 01:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So u have to actually have to have support team role to do anything on the ticket instead of them just having access to a the talkative section for all talkative tickets


[08-Aug-20 01:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also polk, could u add a staff vc 3?


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] stacey#1000
Bonnie didn’t do his voice reveal


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] stacey#1000
There goes my data connection ttyl


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] courtney#5125
another staff vc could be nice


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] anna#0004
@bonnie591 u should talk


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] impact#0297
i'm actually opposed to having a staff vc3


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] ethan;#0003
@Polk why


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] courtney#5125
i feel like i remember having 3 at one point but i have no clue


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] impact#0297
i actually would like to get rid of vc3 for general publi


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] Polk#1596
U JUST JOINED AT THE WRONG TIME LOL


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
no anna no stacey


[08-Aug-20 01:12 PM] anna#0004
@stacey imogen will prob be in the vc


[08-Aug-20 01:13 PM] Polk#1596
if u all want vc3 for staff then we can add it but


[08-Aug-20 01:13 PM] impact#0297
the voice chat 3 just makes people seperate and have their own conversations -- they can do that on their own time via dm's


[08-Aug-20 01:13 PM] Polk#1596
u can remove the timezone vcs if u want


[08-Aug-20 01:13 PM] Polk#1596
we already have private offices


[08-Aug-20 01:14 PM] courtney#5125
yes can we get rid of the timezone vcs?


[08-Aug-20 01:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But like it gets loud and interruptive and people get frustrated


[08-Aug-20 01:14 PM] courtney#5125
no one talks there anyways


[08-Aug-20 01:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like 3 different topics be going on in the same vc


[08-Aug-20 01:14 PM] courtney#5125
ive only seen the bst one get used once a few days ago, but they all left after a few minutes


[08-Aug-20 01:15 PM] impact#0297
who came up with the timezones idea


[08-Aug-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
just get rid of it


[08-Aug-20 01:15 PM] impact#0297
no no no


[08-Aug-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596

[08-Aug-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
ok sure


[08-Aug-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i learned that the hard way in staff lounge

[08-Aug-20 01:26 PM] Polk#1596
board


[08-Aug-20 01:41 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Polk cyto said he was gonna revise the card on the hr board first then let us know when to add it to the operations board


[08-Aug-20 01:41 PM] Polk#1596
oh ok


[08-Aug-20 01:42 PM] Polk#1596
but r u gonna make the card on the hr board as well?


[08-Aug-20 01:42 PM] Polk#1596
ive made the list


[08-Aug-20 01:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ye


[08-Aug-20 01:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Polk wot did he say about slowmode? are we doing it for press conferences and events or wot


[08-Aug-20 01:44 PM] Polk#1596
1) slowmode during press conferences
2) slowmode during times of spamming -- what is the definition of spamming? answer: when we find identifiable individuals who are flooding the chat with repetitive messages


[08-Aug-20 01:45 PM] Polk#1596
like i said earlier, im gonan completely update the whole HR board so just add that and anything else he said and i will make it look clean


[08-Aug-20 01:45 PM] Polk#1596
then he can go over it again to do whatever government official stuff he needs to do on it


[08-Aug-20 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
yeah u can write like during events, such as press conferences and Q&As that require a slow chat to properly function


[08-Aug-20 01:47 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ok


[08-Aug-20 01:49 PM] ethan;#0003

@bonnie591 didn’t we just have a senior vote


[08-Aug-20 02:26 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Or no


[08-Aug-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah but


[08-Aug-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
That was because we needed more assistance


[08-Aug-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
When we hire new shifts we are gonna loose help in the senior role


[08-Aug-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
So I'm just asking if u want 2 more   since fraux and emi are active and without them u might have a problem with getting hosts etc


[08-Aug-20 02:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah fraux and emily were seniors that asked me to host a lot


[08-Aug-20 02:35 PM] courtney#5125
thats true that we'll lose some good seniors, but a lot of the seniors last time werent chosen because they needed time to improve


[08-Aug-20 02:35 PM] courtney#5125
its hard for them to improve after 1 week, in my opinion


[08-Aug-20 02:36 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@courtney good point :thonkexplode:


[08-Aug-20 02:37 PM] courtney#5125
like for example, holly and marissa need more time to improve their maturity and stuff, and marissas relations with cbs


[08-Aug-20 02:37 PM] courtney#5125
mendo and jess were good candidates, but we decided they need more time to ensure theyre ready


[08-Aug-20 02:38 PM] courtney#5125
so that kinda poses the question of.. do we want to hire possibly immature or inexperienced seniors just for the sake of having enough hosts for secondary servers?


[08-Aug-20 02:41 PM] anna#0004
thats true but did we even add all of our good candidates? like what about sarah shes been a manager for ages and very active but i don't think she was nominated for our last vote

@Polk so when I host banning sessions now I don’t archive the cards anymore and leave it under the new list? Or do I transfer the card to the hr board from senior board then archive when the session is done like I normal would do


[08-Aug-20 05:07 PM] Polk#1596
basically, you can continue doing whatever you used to do


[08-Aug-20 05:07 PM] Polk#1596
once ur done u archive the card on the senior board


[08-Aug-20 05:07 PM] Polk#1596
then you come to the hr board


[08-Aug-20 05:08 PM] Polk#1596
make a new card using the format


[08-Aug-20 05:08 PM] Polk#1596
then we have it stay there


[08-Aug-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
Oh oki


[08-Aug-20 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
Thanks for clarifying


[08-Aug-20 05:08 PM] Polk#1596

[08-Aug-20 10:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Suspend her and voice reveal at the same time


[08-Aug-20 10:17 PM] courtney#5125
thats a good idea!!


[08-Aug-20 10:17 PM] courtney#5125
read her suspension notice to her in vc


[08-Aug-20 10:17 PM] courtney#5125

That would be amazing


[08-Aug-20 10:20 PM] impact#0297
is that real or photoshopped


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
there was an announcement to seniors today about checking for users with similar names to mrs at ints


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
and maddy didnt read it


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
like most things she doesnt read


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
she has been suspended for not reading dms and pms


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
and been warned multiple times


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
and just to add on she is not reading announcements


[08-Aug-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
and it turns out, the person who got mod was a CB


[08-Aug-20 10:23 PM] ethan;#0003
someone in the CB server who is friends with the mr who was fired


[08-Aug-20 10:23 PM] ethan;#0003
they said like "I am doing this for my friend who was fired"


[08-Aug-20 10:23 PM] ethan;#0003
something along the lines with that


[08-Aug-20 10:23 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact


[08-Aug-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Idk how you make that mistake


[08-Aug-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I ALWAYS try to type it out


[08-Aug-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It’s honestly not that hard, especially if they are right in front of you


[08-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
the name was Poky_SkyOAIJFOIEAFHJNEASOIFHJEASFOP


[08-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
with letters after


[08-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
and i do type the full name


[08-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
but i assumed the senior checked because of the new rule


[08-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming there was a rule in senior announcements posted today


[08-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
that seniors should be checking before the hr joisn


[08-Aug-20 10:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053

btw @xM_inn people are getting confused with this https://trello.com/c/wiRVlj69/163679-would-this-be-considered-glitching-or-exploiting-ive-been-told-both


[09-Aug-20 11:32 AM] katie#0200
a lot of people including myself thought it was 3+ glitches = major glitching


[09-Aug-20 11:32 AM] katie#0200
but why is the bar an exception


[09-Aug-20 11:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
dat was last year


[09-Aug-20 11:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
very old


[09-Aug-20 11:33 AM] xM_inn#2821
we changed things since then


[09-Aug-20 11:33 AM] xM_inn#2821
a lot of things in the FAQ list are outdated hence why it was deleted


[09-Aug-20 11:34 AM] katie#0200
okay so it is 3+ glitches = major glitching, right?


[09-Aug-20 11:34 AM] katie#0200
and the bar doesn't count as major glitching itself


[09-Aug-20 11:34 AM] katie#0200

like I'm already scheduling that you announce it before fraux's


[09-Aug-20 12:45 PM] stacey#1000
If she doesnt join the vc rip to her


[09-Aug-20 12:45 PM] stacey#1000
but sure ill do it anyways so she can be spammed when she is alive


[09-Aug-20 12:45 PM] stacey#1000
if shes not there


[09-Aug-20 12:46 PM] stacey#1000
ill say I just promoted imogen too


[09-Aug-20 12:46 PM] stacey#1000

[09-Aug-20 12:51 PM] impact#0297
no fraux isn't in the vc


[09-Aug-20 12:51 PM] impact#0297

[09-Aug-20 12:51 PM] impact#0297

[09-Aug-20 12:51 PM] bonnie591#0591

[09-Aug-20 12:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
and we'll update discord roles


[09-Aug-20 12:52 PM] stacey#1000
imogen knows ill announce her promo since shes promoted now


[09-Aug-20 12:52 PM] stacey#1000

[09-Aug-20 12:52 PM] stacey#1000
I just hope shes in it


[09-Aug-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591

[09-Aug-20 12:53 PM] stacey#1000
Imogen got promoted legit like 20 mins before the conference lol


[09-Aug-20 12:53 PM] impact#0297
@bonnie591 sounds good I'll give you guys a heads up with the "so you all have been waiting for the big announcement"


[09-Aug-20 12:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
alright


[09-Aug-20 12:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
btw guys just an idea that we could debate about


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
to prevent more alts getting mod at interviews because of having same name


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could make it so heads and managers get mod when they join interviews


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
and managements get mod when they join training


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
automatically


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
Thats what I suggested to bear before


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
and people agreed on it


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
then people forgot about it


[09-Aug-20 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
.


[09-Aug-20 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
rip


[09-Aug-20 12:56 PM] stacey#1000
but yes we should have that it would save time from leaving to mod servers


[09-Aug-20 12:57 PM] katie#0200
ya

[09-Aug-20 02:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Bloo_Berriez  ok sir


[09-Aug-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
Hey y’all remember how Amqie resigned after only being an MR for a week or so. Well with the report I got earlier if it’s true she would’ve been 1000% terminated and that’s probably why she quit. Probably got a blacklist coming. I’ll keep you updated


[09-Aug-20 02:45 PM] anna#0004
@stacey Was the report from flyro??


[09-Aug-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
Yes yes


[09-Aug-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
Well actually Trey and Flyro


[09-Aug-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
And meowsadiemewow


[09-Aug-20 02:46 PM] anna#0004
Ohhh ok, yeah I think she resigned because of that too like she said she resigned because someone was trying to get her in trouble so she was clearly scared and left


[09-Aug-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
Did they report it to you too?


[09-Aug-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
She made up a fake report she was sexual harassed by another staff member when in reality it was her on an alt doing it for attention


[09-Aug-20 02:47 PM] anna#0004
Well flyro reported something to me before and then he said he thinks amie is behind it but he'd show me when he's back from vacation so I kinda know but it wasn't reported to me


[09-Aug-20 02:47 PM] anna#0004
Yeahhh it was that


[09-Aug-20 02:47 PM] anna#0004
And i blacklisted those accounts


[09-Aug-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
There is more too


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh wow :flushed2:


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
She had apparently got the Amqie account off of someone


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
So it wasn’t even her account allegedly


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] anna#0004
Oml lol


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
And she’s been trolling at the hotel for awhile


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
Goes an alts to troll


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
Well I’m just waiting for the evidence


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] anna#0004
thats crazyyy


[09-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
And flyros statement


[09-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
I’m in a gc with them if anyone else wants to help me with this investigation they can


[09-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
I can add people to the gc


[09-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
Just let me know


[09-Aug-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
I mean all we could do is blacklist Amqie


[09-Aug-20 02:50 PM] courtney#5125
it was really sus how she claimed that she resigned bc someone was threatening to report her and she “didn’t want to fight them”, but she also didn’t tell any of us.....? if u didn’t do something wrong and someone’s trying to get u in trouble, ud think it wouldn’t be a problem to tell an hr. so kinda seemed like she was just resigning super quietly and inconspicuously to avoid being terminated a few days after

Nope

[09-Aug-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
She should not be in the discord server


[09-Aug-20 03:30 PM] courtney#5125

She’s a threat to operations


[09-Aug-20 03:31 PM] stacey#1000
Just put reason as blacklisted: threat to operations


[09-Aug-20 04:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
Y'all, is it just me, or do seniors not ask to host anymore? For my past 3 sessions, I've had to ping in senior lounge asking if people want to host cause nobody has DM'd me.


[09-Aug-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
They do ask me but not all the time anymore.


[09-Aug-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
Like earlier no one asked me and I had 6 servers and had to ask HRs too


[09-Aug-20 04:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ehh i mean when i host i normally get 1-2 dms asking but yeah i do have to go to senior lounge and ask for the other servers


[09-Aug-20 04:37 PM] stacey#1000
I mean we do have a lot of sessions a day and seniors are not available all the time to host all day but


[09-Aug-20 04:37 PM] stacey#1000
When they are online they have to be asked to host


[09-Aug-20 04:42 PM] courtney#5125
same as bloo, I get usually 2 even tho there’s like 10+ online


[09-Aug-20 04:42 PM] courtney#5125
then I need to ping and still usually have a server that doesn’t get hosted


[09-Aug-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
I mean we are a 1 M+ group and do get a lot of servers and we can’t expect seniors to host all the time because it’s understandable they may want to play other games on roblox and have other things. Like hosting 5+ times is a lot. Should we consider getting more seniors than normal? Idek we are a big group and have to consider the seniors that are inactive too


[09-Aug-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
Like Megan and Drew is inactive


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
Wait no only Megan is


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lately drew has been asking me to host so i think hes slowly coming back


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
Might be worth making an announcement


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
Seniors are slacking


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
They're supposed to ask us, not the other way round


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
Hold up tho


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn’t exactly say all of them are slacking


[09-Aug-20 04:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[09-Aug-20 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
Because they do complete their checklist. We don’t want to be overly strict and make them host so many times a day. That’s a lot. We have a lot of sessions a day and it’s unfair to make a senior host like 5+ times a day. It’s a lot. I think we just really don’t have enough seniors.


[09-Aug-20 04:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
we're gonna do a vote soon if baby and bear approves for 2 new seniors


[09-Aug-20 04:47 PM] anna#0004
yeah i literally barely get any


[09-Aug-20 04:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
but


[09-Aug-20 04:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[09-Aug-20 04:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
seniors starting to slack


[09-Aug-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly is 2 enough though


[09-Aug-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
We get like


[09-Aug-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
5+ servers for every training session


[09-Aug-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
And again we can’t make seniors host for every single session there is


[09-Aug-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
We have like 10+ sessions a day


[09-Aug-20 04:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
And also guys yeah we need some new seniors, I've had to let 2 full servers not be hosted since only 3 seniors are available to host


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
So hopefully baby approves senior v ote


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
So we need more BST seniors


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
And I also say 3 seniors rather than 2


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
But that's me


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
And one for EST too please


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cause it seems like activity has dropped


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] katie#0200
Seniors do a lot already and since we’re a large group that is growing quickly, we can only really expect to get more servers. We shouldn’t push seniors to do more because they already do a lot, so maybe we should hire three like Stacey mentioned?


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
dramatically


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
Yes that’s what I’m saying


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
minn what time did u host


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Like rn


[09-Aug-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
We should get maybe 3-4 new seniors like think about it


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
10:45 PM BST / 5:45 PM EST


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
That's prime time near enough


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
We are a 1M+ group


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's weird not having seniors flooding my DMs


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
With a lot of sessions and a lot of servers


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
anyways i need to host, I'll be back soon


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] katie#0200
Mhm


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
But yeah I agree, seniors do also have a lot of duties


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
And seniors in different time zones and they can’t host all the time for every single session


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
And sunday is the day they get most of them done


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] katie#0200
More senior help would be handy because we don’t want to push the current seniors too much


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WHERE ARE OUR NEW SMS 😦


[09-Aug-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
Can we get 3-4 new seniors?


[09-Aug-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t think 2 is enough


[09-Aug-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591


[09-Aug-20 04:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
2 for now, if we need more we'll hire more a few weeks after


[09-Aug-20 04:54 PM] katie#0200
In that case then I think when we get 2 new seniors they’ll be quite active because they want to do senior stuff u know but once a few weeks have passed and their activity drops a bit (maybe it won’t idk), it would be a good time to get more seniors


[09-Aug-20 04:55 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Right now, im clearing up management board if someone wants to help


[09-Aug-20 04:56 PM] stacey#1000

@Beartikal can u invite emily and fraux here


[09-Aug-20 05:13 PM] ethan;#0003
pls


[09-Aug-20 05:30 PM] courtney#5125
2 seniors would be nice, but like I said before, basically all of the seniors that were nominated last time weren’t chosen purely bc they needed more time to improve or needed more time period. do we want possibly immature, not kind, or inexperienced new seniors just for the sake of having enough servers hosted? idk just my opinion!!


[09-Aug-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
I know a couple managers that are ready for senior


[09-Aug-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
acelesteq for sure


[09-Aug-20 05:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes


[09-Aug-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
and xmayva I would say as well


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Acelesteq is more than ready


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
Maya and Jessie


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
And I like Maya


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
What about Holly?


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
She is ready too


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
ive not seen her be immature


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
for like


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
3-4 months


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
she has improved


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
So we have a solid 3 good candidates right there


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
and she has started going to the hotel a lot more


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
yes can we please get 3 new seniors


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Plus anyone else as well


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bonnie591


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
like can we vote on it


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
at least


[09-Aug-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
to see if people want 3


[09-Aug-20 05:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053

No since it isn’t tagged


[09-Aug-20 06:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright.


[09-Aug-20 06:03 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It’s weird idk why that isn’t tagged and ass is lol


[09-Aug-20 06:03 PM] ethan;#0003
I got a new phone and it’s so much easier to type now with my fat thumbs


[09-Aug-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
Impersonators think they are real clever putting capitals in their name. I banned 3 of them trying to get mod, one on each server


[09-Aug-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
They dont pass at my sessions :))


[09-Aug-20 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
Im surprised they havent tried getting admin


[09-Aug-20 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
when I admin seniors


[09-Aug-20 06:12 PM] courtney#5125
wasn’t holly not chosen last time bc she was immature and not super nice to ppl?


[09-Aug-20 06:12 PM] courtney#5125
how much has she improved in 2 weeks?


[09-Aug-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
I mean personally I have not seen her be immature for months


[09-Aug-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
She has been at the hotel a lot more


[09-Aug-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
not to mention I see her ALL the time at sessions


[09-Aug-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
shes BST and goes to late EST sessions still


[09-Aug-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
like she is at my interviews right now


[09-Aug-20 06:13 PM] courtney#5125
I like Jess and maya I just dk how to feel abt holly yet


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
If we can only get two I want jess and maya


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
and next vote holly


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] courtney#5125
agreed


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
if we are allowed 3 holly is the 3rd one I would look at


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] courtney#5125
what abt mendo?


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
My top two picks are jess and maya though


[09-Aug-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
I don't see him as often as I see the others


[09-Aug-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
when was he promoted to manager


[09-Aug-20 06:15 PM] courtney#5125
I’ve been seeing him rlly often, personally. he was promoted to manager on March 1st or 2nd, I believe


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
I would def consider him for the next vote like holly


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] courtney#5125
March 1st, yes


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
but for this one I want jess and maya


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] courtney#5125
yes Jess and maya are my top two


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Maya is on vacation this week so if you dont see her thats why


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
but when she is not on vacation she is SUPER active


[09-Aug-20 06:16 PM] courtney#5125
mayas not the most active manager, but she’s really good at her job and she’s rlly nice


[09-Aug-20 06:17 PM] courtney#5125
ah, yeah I haven’t seen her for a bit


[09-Aug-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
She is at her family's cottage right now


[09-Aug-20 06:17 PM] courtney#5125
she’s just a really nice person to be around too


[09-Aug-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
thats why


[09-Aug-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
yes agreed


[09-Aug-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
same with jess


[09-Aug-20 06:18 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, and there was a concern with her being stressed at sizzleburger, but if that was the case and she was stressed with working at both, I wouldn’t think she’d be working so hard here


[09-Aug-20 06:19 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah, if she couldnt handle two groups like that she wouldve resigned awhile ago


[09-Aug-20 06:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
she went on notice at sb.


[09-Aug-20 06:19 PM] stacey#1000
im guessing


[09-Aug-20 06:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Now she has school, sb, and bloxton.


[09-Aug-20 06:20 PM] stacey#1000
With good time-management it would work well


[09-Aug-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
Everyone that has resigned and tried to blame Bloxton for their school grades going down its their fault because they have bad time-management


[09-Aug-20 06:21 PM] ethan;#0003
i think jess prioritizes bloxton over sizzle


[09-Aug-20 06:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
^


[09-Aug-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
Same tbh


[09-Aug-20 06:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think she said shes been thinking about resigning from SB.


[09-Aug-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
o


[09-Aug-20 06:30 PM] courtney#5125

Whats the merit in dropping Tsunami Sushi from our alliances


[09-Aug-20 07:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
There isn’t a positive tbh


[09-Aug-20 07:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I mean they are inactive so it wouldn’t hurt us


[09-Aug-20 07:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They would just be pissed


[09-Aug-20 07:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
we're getting no gain or benefit in having them as an alliance


[09-Aug-20 07:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

u have to literally build it?


[09-Aug-20 09:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The motherboard is nice, rgb rammm and 2060,could've done 2080 or 2070 but I felt it would be ok


[09-Aug-20 09:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yes you have to build it by like attaching it to the motherboard and then placing it in the case and stuff


[09-Aug-20 09:40 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Its like building legos but its more complicated


[09-Aug-20 09:41 PM] Fraux#7971
does it have instructions like a lego set


[09-Aug-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yes


[09-Aug-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Each piece has its own


[09-Aug-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Motherboard one is huge since its what connects everything


[09-Aug-20 09:41 PM] Fraux#7971
which piece is the motherboard


[09-Aug-20 09:42 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Its like a long circuit board


[09-Aug-20 09:42 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[09-Aug-20 09:42 PM] babymariobebe#7563

meanwhile im here with a macbook 💀


[09-Aug-20 09:44 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The camera is to have a camera because since we're building a pc it doesn't come with an integrated camera


[09-Aug-20 09:44 PM] babymariobebe#7563
For like video calls and what not


[09-Aug-20 09:44 PM] Fraux#7971

Hi noobs


[10-Aug-20 11:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey Let's start by linking up the time zone of the leaker to them time zones


[10-Aug-20 11:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
Then find out what time zone Amqie is


[10-Aug-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
Well what I can say is this was around the time Karebear was promoted


[10-Aug-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
Was Amqie an MR then?


[10-Aug-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
I mean we could question rack but again I doubt she will give us anything and she is the last person I want to talk to

@stacey when did kare get promo


[10-Aug-20 11:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
The leaker is 6 hours behind BST


[10-Aug-20 11:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
That's handy to know


[10-Aug-20 11:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
Not many people are 6 hours behind, so that eliminates them from EST and BST time zones


[10-Aug-20 11:28 AM] Tattoblue#5828
on the 26th @anna


[10-Aug-20 11:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
And when did Amqie resign, for the record?


[10-Aug-20 11:28 AM] anna#0004
o thats same day as when amie did

She’s got some other old photos


[10-Aug-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
ummmmmmmmm is there two leakers


[10-Aug-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Yknow it could also be gotmestartcd because she was fired and she’s bffs with them


[10-Aug-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
cause in the screenshots in #hr-announcements the person is 6 hours behind.. in that screenshot the person is 2 hours ahead


[10-Aug-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
And she’s blacklisted and banned from everything


[10-Aug-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
So she’s got nothing to lose


[10-Aug-20 11:30 AM] katie#0200
I just saw this in management lounge, not sure if it’s related

Everything leaked seems to be from July or before


[10-Aug-20 11:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
There is nothing "recent" in terms of anything from this month


[10-Aug-20 11:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
So there's a strong chance the leaker isnt even an MR anymore


[10-Aug-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
I think it’s gotmestartcd and Amqie


[10-Aug-20 11:30 AM] xM_inn#2821

Ye agreed


[10-Aug-20 11:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
But it looks like it's a mobile screenshot and we should still ask him abt it


[10-Aug-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[10-Aug-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000

[10-Aug-20 11:32 AM] xM_inn#2821

[10-Aug-20 11:33 AM] emily#4444
ya pretty dumb


[10-Aug-20 11:33 AM] xM_inn#2821
Seems kinda odd cause they usually keep this stuff quiet


[10-Aug-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
When I wish  I was still in the cb server now


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
Did u get banned


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Ya


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
oooooh


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
Did they figure u were an ALT


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
d a m n


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmm


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Minn do you want to question rack


[10-Aug-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Or funt


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
To see if you can get anything out of them


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
None thx, both toxic 💀


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
but sure


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I don’t blame you


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
Unless u want to


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
Or anyone else wants to


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
You wouldn’t get anything out of them but if you bribe them with appeal chances since they both wanted to appeal that might work


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
No they the last people I want to talk to


[10-Aug-20 11:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah I'll do that


[10-Aug-20 11:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
But no way we're actually giving them an appeal lol


[10-Aug-20 11:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
Like they crossed a line a long time ago


[10-Aug-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
I think we should suspend MooMoosATTACK to question him


[10-Aug-20 11:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'll question rack first.. he's more favorable than funterrible, I've not had as many altercations with rack


[10-Aug-20 11:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah I'm gonna add a card to the HR Board for Moo


[10-Aug-20 11:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
So we dont forget abt it, cuz its kinda serious


[10-Aug-20 11:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
And u can do the same for the leaking thing too if u want

Too many reports against him


[10-Aug-20 11:38 AM] anna#0004
if moo is a cb dont u think hes just the one leakingggg


[10-Aug-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
Suspending right now


[10-Aug-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah it could be


[10-Aug-20 11:39 AM] xM_inn#2821
Suspend Moo and also add him as a possible suspect for the leaking case


[10-Aug-20 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
The cbs are sending this all to MRs to scare them


[10-Aug-20 11:39 AM] xM_inn#2821
We need Moo's time zone


[10-Aug-20 11:39 AM] xM_inn#2821
Dont remove roles yet


[10-Aug-20 11:39 AM] xM_inn#2821

[10-Aug-20 11:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
I love leaking cases which have evidence


[10-Aug-20 11:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
They're fun to solve


[10-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Can you update the roles


[10-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
On discord


[10-Aug-20 11:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ya


[10-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
I suspended him


[10-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
And remove timezone role


[10-Aug-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
Doen


[10-Aug-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
Done*


[10-Aug-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
Did u send letter


[10-Aug-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
Greetings P_vtrickk,

This is to notify you're currently on an indefinite suspension at Bloxton Hotels due to the suspicion of leaking messages from our MR-only channels to non-authorized users. You'll undergo an interview with myself or a High-Rank shortly, so please respond at your earliest convenience. If you have any questions, please respond accordingly. Thank you.

xM_inn
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels


[10-Aug-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
If not, send that letter, obvs change name and stuff


[10-Aug-20 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I’ll sent that


[10-Aug-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
When u question, add me to the GC


[10-Aug-20 11:46 AM] stacey#1000
Waiting for him to reply right now


[10-Aug-20 11:46 AM] stacey#1000
And Marissa is trying to get the answer out of Diego on who it is


[10-Aug-20 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
But a lot of people have said MooMoosATTACK


[10-Aug-20 11:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alr


[10-Aug-20 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
I told her to tell him if he admitted it, it would look good on his appeal chances


[10-Aug-20 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
To bribe him


[10-Aug-20 11:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly, it could just be CBs trying to get him fired with their sick minds for whatever reasons, however with the evidence of Moo allegedly saying he's a CB and also his time zone being correspondant to the leaker's time zone... it doesn't look good. Hopefully he's cooperative and speaks up about what happened when he's questioned


[10-Aug-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
He won’t reply to me yet


[10-Aug-20 11:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
Probs panicking lol

[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] courtney#5125
wait isn’t she a cb


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] courtney#5125
or was


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Apparently Amie is causing drama in Bloxton Discord


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
She was a CB candy]


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
I promoted that girl to head 😭 👊


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
TWICE


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
as well

):


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
I see she soon got bored of being a CB


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] courtney#5125
I guess so


[10-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Havent seen her for ages


[10-Aug-20 11:59 AM] courtney#5125
sameeee


[10-Aug-20 11:59 AM] courtney#5125
she doesn’t want to appeal everything rn I don’t think, just her discord ban


[10-Aug-20 12:00 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I gtg have lunch so if you want you can ask MooMoos some questions or I can continue when I’m back


[10-Aug-20 12:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'll ask some


[10-Aug-20 12:23 PM] ethan;#0003
I think it’s real


[10-Aug-20 12:24 PM] ethan;#0003
I said yesterday that when he became mr I looked at his profile and saw he was friends with a lot of CBS main accounts


[10-Aug-20 12:30 PM] Fraux#7971
yeah it could be bc if the past like you said


[10-Aug-20 12:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok guys so Amie is CST too


[10-Aug-20 12:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
So her and Moo have the same time zone correspondent to the leaker's time zone


[10-Aug-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
Diego is saying it’s not MooMoos


[10-Aug-20 12:58 PM] stacey#1000
There is no evidence of him admitting it. Just people saying it’s him


[10-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t think it’s him. On the other hand. Amqie is getting blacklisted later for trolling and stuff on alts


[10-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
But Diego is also saying it’s a current mr


[10-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
So let’s start by seeing which MRs are in Cst timezone


[10-Aug-20 12:59 PM] stacey#1000
Well, heads


[10-Aug-20 01:04 PM] courtney#5125
kylieenoir, r4ses, rnadds, IcyFoxxGamer, MooMoosATTACK


[10-Aug-20 01:04 PM] courtney#5125
uhhhhhhhh


[10-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
jz_sy


[10-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
idk any others


[10-Aug-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
He also said it was someone normal.  From what he told Marissa but still I got no clue


[10-Aug-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
someone normal?


[10-Aug-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
normal how


[10-Aug-20 01:06 PM] stacey#1000
Idek


[10-Aug-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
someone we don’t suspect?


[10-Aug-20 01:06 PM] stacey#1000
I think so


[10-Aug-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
hmph


[10-Aug-20 01:09 PM] stacey#1000
I found something interesting


[10-Aug-20 01:10 PM] stacey#1000
The person saying it was Moo without real evidence was Amqie :thinkception:

[10-Aug-20 01:16 PM] courtney#5125
so maybe she’s just trying to get us off her back and onto his


[10-Aug-20 01:17 PM] courtney#5125
i wouldn’t say amqie is the most reliable source alone


[10-Aug-20 01:18 PM] stacey#1000
I mean she’s already getting blacklisted later and resigned because she was scared of getting reported to get fired


[10-Aug-20 01:18 PM] courtney#5125
right yeah


[10-Aug-20 01:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I rescheduled my 12s to the 13th


[10-Aug-20 01:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
so if anyone want the 6:00 PM CST >>> time positions on the 12th.


[10-Aug-20 01:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
its open now


[10-Aug-20 02:31 PM] xM_inn#2821

[10-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
Hes a CB but doesnt mean hes the one who leaked


[10-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
hes not the one who leaked


[10-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
still got that to worry about


[10-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
but he did admit to being a CB easier than I thought


[10-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
he still gets fired for taht


[10-Aug-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
that*


[10-Aug-20 02:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ye ik


[10-Aug-20 02:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm just glad you got him to admit that


[10-Aug-20 02:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cuz he was lying at first

[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
you can question him on it


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
regarding the video


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
and especially if it was your int session


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
ye question him on that


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
cinder said that he account shared with him


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
when he was an MR


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
last time he was an mr


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
not nor


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
now


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
if it was over a year ago


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
not much we can do on that


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
without valid evidence


[10-Aug-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
he could still be doing it


[10-Aug-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
and cinder cant really be trusted either


[10-Aug-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
he made a tea video


[10-Aug-20 03:30 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah ik but the times we have gotten reports like that from cinder they seem to be correct


[10-Aug-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
he would need evidence of him admitting it


[10-Aug-20 03:32 PM] Fraux#7971
ok i am bouta be on interstate so catch y’all in a few@


[10-Aug-20 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
oki


[10-Aug-20 03:33 PM] Tattoblue#5828
> whats her time zone
@xM_inn  bst


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey agreed, there isn’t proof of the account sharing


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
thank u tattoo


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
last year


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
wasnt sage fired


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
for account sharing?


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
with cinder


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
he resigned


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
o


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
but


[10-Aug-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
and it was never brought to our attention when he was an MR before


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
cinder went to the hotel on his account, no?


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
i remember something like that happening


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
like we cant fire him for something that was over a yaer ago


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
and like why is he informing us now...? and not when he was an mr before...?


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
probs cuz they're no longer friends


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
cinder legit just cannot be trusted


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
ik


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
r


[10-Aug-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
so I dont trust that


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
cinder only reports people when it's of more benefit to him


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
hes known for trying to get people fired


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
hence why he makes tea videos


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
that video he had of cam


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
was very good


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
so god knows what else he can do


[10-Aug-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
exactly


[10-Aug-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000

[10-Aug-20 05:11 PM] Fraux#7971
that's the only thing i can think of


[10-Aug-20 05:12 PM] katie#0200
wait wdym


[10-Aug-20 05:12 PM] katie#0200
I thought bans don't transfer?


[10-Aug-20 05:13 PM] Fraux#7971
They're IP pans


[10-Aug-20 05:17 PM] katie#0200
Basically she got her roblox account from a user that's banned on the discord, would that count?


[10-Aug-20 05:21 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey what was the recording used for


[10-Aug-20 05:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and where was it found


[10-Aug-20 05:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and who did he send it to


[10-Aug-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
kylieenoir sent it to roxie and roxie informed me right away.


[10-Aug-20 05:22 PM] ethan;#0003
he needs to be questioned about it


[10-Aug-20 05:22 PM] ethan;#0003
on what was his reason for recording the call


[10-Aug-20 05:23 PM] ethan;#0003
wait that recording must of been a few weeks ago

[10-Aug-20 05:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
july 10th


[10-Aug-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yes that was a bit ago


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i remember flyro singing happy birthday to him


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
But he still recorded VCs


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
why wasnt it reported until now?


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
No clue


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
right


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
when were they promoted


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] ethan;#0003
because people like to ruin promotions


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i dont like how people do that


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
like an hour ago


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
exactly ethan, i recommend no action


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] ethan;#0003
they dont report stuff until they get promoted


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like report it when it happens not when someone gets promoted


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] ethan;#0003
this has happened so many times...


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
There is not much we can do


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
its annoying


[10-Aug-20 05:24 PM] ethan;#0003
people get reported as they are getting promoted


[10-Aug-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
I dont when to question him for something minor


[10-Aug-20 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they want action taking, report it before the promo and they need to stop crying when someone gets promoted to mr that they dont like


[10-Aug-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
when he legit just got promoted


[10-Aug-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
ok so I will leave it as is

[10-Aug-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000

[10-Aug-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003

When was this staff lounge rule document made by MRs to be sent to people every time someone was promoted-


[11-Aug-20 10:02 AM] katie#0200
happy 3 years!!!! @stacey


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
Thank you!!


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] katie#0200
Also no clue, mrs made it themselves


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
So uh the rule document thing


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
Was leaked to Cbs


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
And has a lot of info in it


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
A former could easily have it to leak


[11-Aug-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
So whatever MR made it best remove it or they could face consequences


[11-Aug-20 10:04 AM] stacey#1000
Do you know who made it?


[11-Aug-20 10:04 AM] katie#0200
I believe it was uni but I’m not 100% sure, I’ll try and find out one min


[11-Aug-20 10:04 AM] katie#0200
Liv, uni and mia

It’s been leaked


[11-Aug-20 10:05 AM] stacey#1000

[11-Aug-20 10:05 AM] stacey#1000

[11-Aug-20 10:06 AM] stacey#1000

@stacey  I don't think so, but bonnie pinned it in staff lounge a while ago so it was known about


[11-Aug-20 10:17 AM] Tattoblue#5828
i think roblox servers are pooping


[11-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
I told Uni to remove it and not make a new one for now considering someone is actively leaking possibly and it was leaked


[11-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
So it’s done for now


[11-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000

"he said in my dms he created it"


[12-Aug-20 11:57 AM] Polk#1596
your dms:
its fake


[12-Aug-20 11:58 AM] Polk#1596
oh my god


[12-Aug-20 11:58 AM] Polk#1596
this "bot" is sending those youtube videos with a shady url to get ips


[12-Aug-20 11:59 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I don’t know i banned the account from the discord. So they might be on another account just pulling names


[12-Aug-20 11:59 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Or something idk


[12-Aug-20 12:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The most at this point is alert people about the fake bot and don’t click on any links it sends you.


[12-Aug-20 12:18 PM] courtney#5125
when did alloe resignnn


[12-Aug-20 12:19 PM] courtney#5125
must’ve been today or yesterday, she went quietly


[12-Aug-20 12:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it was like last night or something


[12-Aug-20 12:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, someone just told me they reported the fake bot and said it was banned.


[12-Aug-20 12:33 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey i agree on banning him, ever since he's resigned hes been acting out of hand


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn Permission to blacklist and ban bman from all bloxton platforms?


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821

[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm fine with it


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
but


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
You need perms from @Hilton Founder or @Strategic Advisor first


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let them provide their opinions first


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Due to his current position and previous altercations


[12-Aug-20 12:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
altercations what a fancy word


[12-Aug-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes


[12-Aug-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm full of fancy words


[12-Aug-20 12:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
😌


[12-Aug-20 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
lmao


[12-Aug-20 12:49 PM] Polk#1596
well


[12-Aug-20 12:49 PM] Polk#1596
what did we expect


[12-Aug-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
Legit I use to be great friends with bman when he was an HR then when he resigned I barely talk to him and he has an attitude towards me as if I’m a bad guy for staying on the HR team


[12-Aug-20 02:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
We got a bear impersonator btw https://gyazo.com/596fc1c2df876505fa25ff62d3629d4a

THEY FINALLY DECIDED TO IMPERSONATE ME


[12-Aug-20 02:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Everyone got a impersonator now? I thought I was special.


[12-Aug-20 02:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
Smhhh


[12-Aug-20 02:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Can I be myself? Can I be me by myself and not with anyone else?


[12-Aug-20 02:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Y'all


[12-Aug-20 02:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
What if the impersonators are the CBs


[12-Aug-20 02:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cuz up until I spoke to a CB today, I haven't had one of those impersonators!


[12-Aug-20 02:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Coincidence :eyesshaking:


[12-Aug-20 02:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I wouldn't be surprised if it was them.


[12-Aug-20 02:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
Sameee


[12-Aug-20 02:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
Timing is very interesting tho


[12-Aug-20 02:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
I speak to a CB and a few hours later I have someone suddenly finding me relevant enough to be impersonated!!


[12-Aug-20 02:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
da heck


[12-Aug-20 02:34 PM] Beartikal#9760

@Beartikal pingZ


[12-Aug-20 02:41 PM] Fraux#7971
@stacey yeah that’s immature and unnecessary and the fact he is still continuing is ridiculous


[12-Aug-20 02:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
Which senior? Was it Erick?

[12-Aug-20 02:43 PM] Fraux#7971
@ miss stacey ^


[12-Aug-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
It was Megan


[12-Aug-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
She informed me thinking it was wrong of his actions and she felt uncomfortable too


[12-Aug-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
He was trash talking and trying to convince her to resign


[12-Aug-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
“If you resign I got stories to tell you about the HRs”


[12-Aug-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll get her to send screenshots of what he deleted and said


[12-Aug-20 02:47 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yikes


[12-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
Basically the second Megan comes back from Inactivity and gets her pc back bman messages her and full on trash talking


[12-Aug-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
And sends her a list of pros of why she should resign


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] Fraux#7971
So what I take from that is once she resigns he would possibly leak to her?


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
She ain’t resigning lmao


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
That is basically what he said


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] Fraux#7971
Yep that’s what I’m taking from it


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] Fraux#7971
Bman just doesn’t know when to stop. He does too much it’s ridiculous


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok that's a threat to operations


[12-Aug-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
Megan is gonna send me some photos


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
If he's saying once she resigns he'll leak.. he's a significant threat


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
and hypocritical considering how many leakers he's fired in his time but OH WELL


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
The “I’ll tell you stories about the HRs” once she resigns is threatening to leak


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
And Megan was scared she would get in trouble


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
So she told me about him


[12-Aug-20 02:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Good


[12-Aug-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Hilton Founder Thoughts on the above?


[12-Aug-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
He already leaked to her basically I think


[12-Aug-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
Try and get as many screenshots as possible


[12-Aug-20 02:52 PM] stacey#1000
I remember he said this: “baby and bear are (snowflake emoji I can’t find it)” 

Idk what that meant tho


[12-Aug-20 02:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Uh the impersonators are tryna IP grab again https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597449934307983370/743194975629476040/image0.png

are they in the server or did they jus accept a friend request?


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey the snowflake emoji basically means that they’re  sensitive basically and soft


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
Idk


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
I just told MRs not to reply to them in staff lounge


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
Giving them the attention influences them to continue


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
I had to tell MRs not to associate with the Bloxton bot person going around


[12-Aug-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
And they still do it

it was unintentional and accidental, keeping in mind only trey and JJJ were in the VC too


[12-Aug-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
So a formal warning is going to be issued


[12-Aug-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
He also unmaliciously ear-raped.. however it was once again accidental as he was testing out some plugin voice changer he got


[12-Aug-20 04:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053

So promoting a very strong senior who just so happens to be a friend is bias now??


[12-Aug-20 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
oh lol


[12-Aug-20 04:55 PM] Fraux#7971
That's perfectly fine, I'd rather know how he felt as opposed to have him as a "friend" with him having hidden his true opinions of me


[12-Aug-20 04:56 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Aug-20 06:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
I won't go into details or send proof


[12-Aug-20 06:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'll just say pretty much leaked, threatened to leak, and trash-talked us.

Greetings BmanPlays,

This letter serves as of 13/08/2020 at 12:20 AM BST confirming your official blacklist from all Bloxton Hotels platforms. The High-Rank Team has recently affirmed evidence surrounding you continuing to trash-talk our group, threatening to leak, and successfully leaking classified information. Due to the aforementioned actions committed, you're now deemed as a threat to our operations and have been revoked access to all Bloxton Hotel platforms effective immediately. As a former High-Rank yourself, you're held to much higher expectations and morals. Your committed actions are simply unacceptable and thus you have been blacklisted. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate in replying to this letter. 

Signed,

xM_inn
Board of Directors

@xM_inn


[12-Aug-20 06:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes since she's the reporter, but she can't pass that on otherwise she's subject to being disciplined for leaking


[12-Aug-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[12-Aug-20 06:26 PM] ethan;#0003

or is he going to be allowed to appeal....?


[12-Aug-20 06:31 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Most likely not considering he didn't learn after his apology he'd just be lying again


[12-Aug-20 06:31 PM] stacey#1000

Bman Evidence *FOR HRS+ ONLY*
This is some of the photos of Bman messaging Megan, one of the seniors some quite questionable things. All he has to say is basically trash talk and disrespect, even if it’s in DMs. This made her upset and knew it was wrong, hence why she informed me ASAP.  Not sure if this is...

[13-Aug-20 10:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
Refer to that document for the information.


[13-Aug-20 10:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
He pretty much leaked, threatened to leak, and trash-talked us once again.


[13-Aug-20 10:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
Also tried to make a senior resign. This all happened in Megan's DMs.


[13-Aug-20 10:38 AM] impact#0297
Sooo did we ban him


[13-Aug-20 10:38 AM] impact#0297
From the Discord? @xM_inn


[13-Aug-20 10:38 AM] xM_inn#2821
Mhm


[13-Aug-20 10:38 AM] xM_inn#2821
All platforms related to us


[13-Aug-20 10:38 AM] xM_inn#2821
He's gone


[13-Aug-20 10:39 AM] xM_inn#2821
He was formally notified by me regarding his blacklist as well so the communication is all sorted


[13-Aug-20 10:42 AM] impact#0297
Who put there name on the ban


[13-Aug-20 10:42 AM] impact#0297

👍


[13-Aug-20 10:44 AM] impact#0297
Please, when communicating with Bman, just stick to key messages and don’t divert and give him details. Just really nervous he’s gonna find us slip and soak that shit


[13-Aug-20 10:45 AM] impact#0297
I want to commend you all for keeping Bman at bay during this time. @xM_inn @stacey @Fraux @High Rank


[13-Aug-20 10:46 AM] impact#0297
At the end of the day today, I will have worked 70 hours this week. I have no intentions of hosting a meeting this Saturday.


[13-Aug-20 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
He hasn’t messaged me anyways. But I told Megan not to associate with him if he questions her about this or tries to trash talk


[13-Aug-20 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
So she unfriended him and doesn’t message him now


[13-Aug-20 10:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yup, this is all that I've said to Bman, I've tried avoiding as much communication as possible as his questions are just ridiculous honestly; https://gyazo.com/444af583fa0862de4f1c173e85a90203

[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] courtney#5125
a lot of times theyre the ones that start conversations with them too


[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] courtney#5125
which is annoying


[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Really?


[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Wow


[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] courtney#5125
they hear abt a fake kj going around, and instead of waiting for fake kj to dm them, they go out looking for trouble by dming him first


[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
I told a couple of them yesterday not to associate with them


[13-Aug-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
And a senior is dming me now saying a lot more are doing it


[13-Aug-20 11:24 AM] Fraux#7971
@stacey id say announce then warn if it continues


[13-Aug-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
Gotcha


[13-Aug-20 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn permission to make announcement?


[13-Aug-20 11:25 AM] Fraux#7971
that’s just my take though


[13-Aug-20 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
Oo this might be a good opportunity for emily or you fraux to make MR announcements!!!


[13-Aug-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
@emily


[13-Aug-20 11:27 AM] emily#4444
oo okay


[13-Aug-20 11:27 AM] emily#4444
i agree w fraux though


[13-Aug-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
If we do announce would you like to do your first mr announcement?


[13-Aug-20 11:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
Helllooooo


[13-Aug-20 11:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
Just to MRs if u do announce


[13-Aug-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
Yes ok


[13-Aug-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
So we good to announce now


[13-Aug-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Ill do it if no one else wants to


[13-Aug-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
And if anyone mentions it in the discord, encourage MRs to send a polite DM to the user and explain to them it is an impersonator if they're confused


[13-Aug-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
Rather than discussing it directly in the discord


[13-Aug-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
But @emily do you want to do your first announcement? I can help you write it if you want


[13-Aug-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
Omg go emily !!!


[13-Aug-20 11:30 AM] emily#4444

[13-Aug-20 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
Oki so in the announcement we mention it’s best not to associate with the impersonators going around because it encourages them. If they know of one going around and they get a friend request sent to them by one, it’s best to decline it and inform an Hr about it. They want attention and by replying and messaging them gives them the attention they want. If we hear of an mr messaging them after the announcement they can be warned verbally. Stuff like that in it. Do you want me to write it for you? 

@emily


[13-Aug-20 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
@Fraux best to question him about it


[13-Aug-20 11:41 AM] emily#4444
i'll try write one, can i send it to u when im done !


[13-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Yes yes ofc!


[13-Aug-20 11:41 AM] emily#4444

[13-Aug-20 11:53 AM] Fraux#7971
ok it seems to be all good, auto correct changed it to that bc he had been friends with her so it’s in the keyboard thing


[13-Aug-20 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn why does Megan have your office key role


[13-Aug-20 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
Did u give her it


[13-Aug-20 12:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
Uhhh idk


[13-Aug-20 12:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't think so


[13-Aug-20 12:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't remember her asking me


[13-Aug-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
Can you remove the role then idk why she has it @xM_inn


[13-Aug-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
Unless she can keep it but like other MRs want it too now


[13-Aug-20 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
She can keep it idm who has it


[13-Aug-20 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
The role only gives them access to the VC

Bit of a decrease so far this week, anyway we can try to promote something in the DC this weekend?


[13-Aug-20 10:58 PM] impact#0297
Honestly when I'm back we can do consistent announcements based on decisions


[13-Aug-20 10:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Public Game Night?


[13-Aug-20 10:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I like that KJ


[13-Aug-20 10:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
maybe a game or two


[13-Aug-20 10:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
or a PS event


[13-Aug-20 11:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
oh we already do those


[13-Aug-20 11:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL I barely look at the event announcement channel


[13-Aug-20 11:00 PM] impact#0297
hoping Baby & Bear don't go rogue during college though


[13-Aug-20 11:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
well we can make it more of a Bloxton event at the TC or something unique


[13-Aug-20 11:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053

See I would’ve promoted her but I promoted her to rank 8 and don’t want to promote people twice anymore so that’s why I’m glad someone else can do it


[14-Aug-20 02:00 PM] courtney#5125

[14-Aug-20 02:27 PM] stacey#1000
The only thing not in the guide is you have to ask for their trello isername


[14-Aug-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Username*


[14-Aug-20 02:28 PM] Fraux#7971
guys this is my first promotion how should I do it


[14-Aug-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
I got an idea


[14-Aug-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Do it the way I promoted her to head and caught her off guard


[14-Aug-20 02:28 PM] Fraux#7971
ok what did you do


[14-Aug-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Get a manager to teleport to her and name her manager when she thinks she being picked to train. Then announce it the second she is named manager


[14-Aug-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
It will catch her off guard


[14-Aug-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
I got maya to do that when I promoted her to rank 8


[14-Aug-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t want to promote her twice in a row that’s why I’m glad you are


[14-Aug-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
You can do that or something else


[14-Aug-20 02:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah thats good one, i like to do things where people least expect it ya know


[14-Aug-20 02:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause then its not fun when you got people in chat like "I think someone might get promoted" and then others start going "Omg someone is def getting promoted"


[14-Aug-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
Yes ikr


[14-Aug-20 02:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Fraux When r u promoting!


[14-Aug-20 02:54 PM] Fraux#7971

[14-Aug-20 02:55 PM] Fraux#7971

[14-Aug-20 02:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[14-Aug-20 02:59 PM] Fraux#7971

[14-Aug-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
It’s more fun at sessions


[14-Aug-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Because at the hotel you always get the trollers that ruin it


[14-Aug-20 03:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ye sessions get more of a staff reaction


[14-Aug-20 03:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
and more people to congratulate the person etc


[14-Aug-20 03:09 PM] Fraux#7971

Mhmm, still got a leaker. its obvious it's a head. But we gotta likely shutdown staff lounge for security precautions, as I have no idea who it is as of right now.


[14-Aug-20 08:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
good work cyto on surviving!


[14-Aug-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
Thoughts on shutting down staff lounge?


[14-Aug-20 08:50 PM] impact#0297
Denied a million times over.


[14-Aug-20 08:51 PM] impact#0297
That's the fastest way to piss off our staff.


[14-Aug-20 08:51 PM] impact#0297
Make an announcement or investigate further


[14-Aug-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
Hard to investigate it when all the CBs aren't going to snitch on who's doing it.


[14-Aug-20 08:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
If u make an announcement the leaker is gonna catch we're on to them, potentially


[14-Aug-20 08:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
Investigate further, let them leak more so we get more evidence against them


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well not let them leak more ofc, but like the more evidence we get the better


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
The thing is, the cbs know we know there is a leaker. So they keep message MRs leaked photos.


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
They are doing this to scare the MRs.


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Can you link the time zone in the screenshots to the time of the messages


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
We need to start with the time zone of the leaker


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
And assuming it's a head considering manager+ access stuff could be leaked otherwise


[14-Aug-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
I will see


[14-Aug-20 08:54 PM] stacey#1000
someone in BST


[14-Aug-20 08:54 PM] stacey#1000
It was at 8:36 PM EST, photo says 1:36 AM. BST timezone


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] impact#0297
Are they leaking staff lounge?


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
Mhm


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
I thought we already fired who did it


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
but guess not


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] impact#0297
That's not brutal, but it's worth a flag.


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
It is bad when they are leaking this to CBs, then the CBs go and message the MRs and harrassing them and scaring them


[14-Aug-20 08:55 PM] impact#0297

shes friends with gotmestartcd and avomrii who were highly involved with trash talking in the cb server

if she is friends with gotmestartcd


[14-Aug-20 09:07 PM] stacey#1000
it would make sense she would search her name in the discord


[14-Aug-20 09:07 PM] stacey#1000
and leak what is said to other cbs


[14-Aug-20 09:08 PM] stacey#1000
its likely her


[14-Aug-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Aug-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
I looked into it more


[14-Aug-20 09:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
What did u find


[14-Aug-20 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
She is friends with gotmestartcd that was terminated, same with xxMewTimes, and she is friends with other users that are in the CB server as well and highly involved in it. If she is friends with gotmestartcd it would make sense for her to search up what was said about her and send it to her. There is also troll alt accounts with the name othue that is friends with diego, etc.  She is also in the same timezone the leaked image was sent.


[14-Aug-20 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
She has her inv off but badges, she played speed run to get badges so its an obv alt acc


[14-Aug-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
It all just seems super sus


[14-Aug-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
and if she has her DMs off where no one can message her the suspension letter, she will have to turn her messages on herself and contact an HR

[14-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
Yea I think so


[14-Aug-20 10:41 PM] courtney#5125
yaaa i got sent it too, didnt know what to do with it


[14-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
The one complaining saying they have no good moderation and is toxic?


[14-Aug-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
I mean, tbh Breezy’s has never done any events with Bloxton


[14-Aug-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
So if we are looking into our current allies, Breezy’s is the one that majorly concerns me


[14-Aug-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
Idek


[14-Aug-20 10:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
dont we also have some concerns with tsunami sushi too


[14-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
We have had some with sizzle in the past too


[14-Aug-20 10:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like i dont ever see them getting themselves involved with events


[14-Aug-20 10:44 PM] stacey#1000
We had problems with sizzles developers coming and glitching at the hotel, and then their HR team saying they don’t represent the group and couldn’t do anything and then the other thing too. We wanted to unally before


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah i remember that


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
Sizzle doesn’t do anything in regards to when we report something to them and doesn’t take it serious it seems


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
We had a couple issues with that


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
They haven't done anything since


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
And they're active with their alliances, etc


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what about koala, anything there


[14-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah but it’s still a point to bring up


[14-Aug-20 10:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
No of course, but I don't think it's strong to remove them for it now cause it's a while ago


[14-Aug-20 10:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
Besides, they were warned for it


[14-Aug-20 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
No I’m not saying remove them


[14-Aug-20 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
Im just bringing it up since we discussing allies now


[14-Aug-20 10:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ah ok


[14-Aug-20 10:47 PM] stacey#1000
If we are looking at removing one. I vote remove breezys


[14-Aug-20 10:47 PM] courtney#5125
waaaaaaaaaaaait when are we changing up the ally representatives? ive been meaning to ask


[14-Aug-20 10:47 PM] stacey#1000
Breezys doesn’t do anything for events, never has


[14-Aug-20 10:47 PM] stacey#1000
And we got complaints they have bad moderation and is a toxic environment


[14-Aug-20 10:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk if baby and bear would wanna remove breezy's though, it's owned by builder boy.


[14-Aug-20 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
True


[14-Aug-20 10:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
same with CCC


[14-Aug-20 10:49 PM] impact#0297
I'm in General. I will stream the making of the briefing note for any suggestions or recommendations.


[14-Aug-20 10:49 PM] stacey#1000
I mean idc if they stay they will just always be an ally that is more quiet and doesn’t do events for Bloxton I guess


[14-Aug-20 10:49 PM] impact#0297
I encourage you to join.


[14-Aug-20 10:49 PM] stacey#1000

Easier than explaining it all.

[14-Aug-20 10:55 PM] stacey#1000
We have had big alliance visits with them


[14-Aug-20 10:55 PM] stacey#1000
Them hosting idk


[14-Aug-20 10:55 PM] stacey#1000
Let me check


[14-Aug-20 10:56 PM] stacey#1000
They haven’t really done events themselves


[14-Aug-20 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
Search boba in event announcements


[14-Aug-20 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
If any alliance did an event it would be posted there


[14-Aug-20 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
May madness was Bloxton events


[14-Aug-20 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
It’s stuff we did with them but they have never came to us with an event themselves


[14-Aug-20 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
Yes

[14-Aug-20 11:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
All allies were notified of the HRs on there who resigned thouigh


[14-Aug-20 11:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
And they were removed of their allied rep roles


[14-Aug-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
Ya baby owns it

[14-Aug-20 11:06 PM] stacey#1000
They don’t host much events tho


[14-Aug-20 11:07 PM] stacey#1000
They have never done alliance events really

[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] Fraux#7971
Not trying to be rude.. But breezy's doesn't seem like the most organized group


[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] courtney#5125
yessirrr


[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
Breezys doesn’t benefit us in any way


[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] Fraux#7971
Regarding that document


[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
They don’t host any events and their moderation sucks


[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] courtney#5125
yeah having them as an ally isnt beneficial whatsoever


[14-Aug-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
Idk anything about Glazin


[14-Aug-20 11:21 PM] courtney#5125
same


[14-Aug-20 11:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Breezy's revamped in April I think? Anyways.. didn't last long; their owner or whoever annoyed SHRs and they all quit and some went rogue (banned literally everyone from their Discord) and since then it just died again.


[14-Aug-20 11:21 PM] Fraux#7971
I have never heard anything from ccc


[14-Aug-20 11:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
They dont even have a discord if I'm right


[14-Aug-20 11:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
They have no communication with us


[14-Aug-20 11:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Apart from Clay to Baby and Bear, I assume


[14-Aug-20 11:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
But otherwise.. let's say I needed to contact a rep from there or any HR for that matter, we can't.


[14-Aug-20 11:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cause there's nobody to go to.


[14-Aug-20 11:22 PM] stacey#1000
Breezys just needs to go tbh


[14-Aug-20 11:22 PM] Fraux#7971
Yeah I can not think of how you would go about doing that


[14-Aug-20 11:22 PM] stacey#1000
Like how is it benefitting Bloxton as an ally


[14-Aug-20 11:22 PM] Fraux#7971
Can;'t see group wall


[14-Aug-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve had people report that doc to me twice because they are shocked we are allies with them

I am not in group, anyone in it


[14-Aug-20 11:23 PM] xM_inn#2821

@impact tsunami sushi has been doing very good recently


[14-Aug-20 11:44 PM] ethan;#0003
about half a year ago they changed owners


[14-Aug-20 11:44 PM] ethan;#0003
and now the player count has gone from 5 to 100+


[14-Aug-20 11:44 PM] ethan;#0003
and they have gained like 30k in half a year


[14-Aug-20 11:44 PM] ethan;#0003
when it took the old owner 5 years to reach 70k


[14-Aug-20 11:46 PM] Fraux#7971
Personally i've noticed that too, but I want to keep watch and see if that can be maintained

[15-Aug-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821

[15-Aug-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I highly recommend not hosting a movie night. I definitely won’t be hosting one even for just MRs with a leaker.


[15-Aug-20 03:26 PM] stacey#1000
I believe I’m the only one so far that has ever hosted one. So jsyk I won’t be for now


[15-Aug-20 03:27 PM] stacey#1000
If we get rid of the leaker possibly


[15-Aug-20 03:28 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Aug-20 08:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Fraux @emily who would like to promote someone to senior this time? you will have the person kj doesnt pick, if you dont promote this time then you can next time

@stacey Could you perhaps speak to cardriven2222#6172 -- he has some information on CB's and the MR's that are leaking. I vetted him a little so he should be worth your time.


[16-Aug-20 02:45 AM] emily#4444
@bonnie591 sure


[16-Aug-20 05:40 AM] stacey#1000
@impact He had information on formers leaking that are already blacklisted so not much we can do. There is still a current MR leaking but we have one suspended for questioning and it’s probably her so.


[16-Aug-20 08:30 AM] stacey#1000

smh my head


[16-Aug-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Also Sophia is in est, the leaker is bst


[16-Aug-20 09:01 AM] stacey#1000
Not sure if othue is the one who actually leaked we are still finding that out but either way she’s still terminated at the end of it


[16-Aug-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
And tatto its my fault for adding her to the promotion opinions without looking into it further. My bad


[16-Aug-20 09:17 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@Polk @ethan; @Bloo_Berriez i ranked ur passers u nooby noobs 😄

[16-Aug-20 11:50 AM] KjRBLX#2053

The training would be 5 your time


[16-Aug-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
The training is probably the most fun place to do a senior promo


[16-Aug-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
I want to be there too so


[16-Aug-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
Maya gets to have fun with a 10 hour car drive home today


[16-Aug-20 11:52 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I should be at home by that time unless my parents just bring something up unexpectedly


[16-Aug-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
I can change my training to a bit later if needed. Just let me know but she is going to my sessions for sure


[16-Aug-20 11:53 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright. 👍🏽


[16-Aug-20 01:02 PM] courtney#5125

im pretty sure the invite is now invalid as well too, marissa said he deleted it immediately after sending it. still, something to be aware of


[16-Aug-20 01:07 PM] courtney#5125
Sourmoqns is supposedly diegos staff acc that he wants to be promoted on, im not sure what the other accounts are though

[16-Aug-20 01:09 PM] courtney#5125
i mean ofc it could also be cbs trying to get innnocent staff members in trouble, but theyre going to an extreme length to do so if thats what their goal is

[16-Aug-20 03:27 PM] stacey#1000
I say suspend him for questioning


[16-Aug-20 03:27 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn thoughts?


[16-Aug-20 03:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Patrick sent me those screenshots @stacey


[16-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[16-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
I still say suspend aivdan tho


[16-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
if there is still a leaker


[16-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
its a head


[16-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
they are in bst


[16-Aug-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
and aidan meets that description


[16-Aug-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[16-Aug-20 03:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It’s just odd how like not even 5 minutes after that, she joined THEBUILDER in game saying that. Assuming someone may possibly be telling her that they’re talking about her in staff lounge.


[16-Aug-20 03:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey granted


[16-Aug-20 03:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
add to GC


[16-Aug-20 03:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
othue is on hold for now till we finish with aidan


[16-Aug-20 03:33 PM] stacey#1000
lets just question every single head thats in bst till we find who it is


[16-Aug-20 03:33 PM] stacey#1000
ok will do


[16-Aug-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
if its not aivdan


[16-Aug-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
then it could be dawson_z


[16-Aug-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
hes bst as well and I believe friends with gotmestartcd as well


[16-Aug-20 03:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[16-Aug-20 03:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[16-Aug-20 03:48 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[16-Aug-20 04:02 PM] courtney#5125
i thought we dont review the hinting reports channel anymore?


[16-Aug-20 04:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
We dont??


[16-Aug-20 04:17 PM] courtney#5125
didnt we decide at a meeting that we would just use it when we're looking to promote someone


[16-Aug-20 04:17 PM] courtney#5125
we wouldnt review it and put it on the board


[16-Aug-20 04:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[16-Aug-20 04:17 PM] courtney#5125

[16-Aug-20 04:17 PM] courtney#5125
a few meetings ago


[16-Aug-20 04:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
:0 I just looked at the channel and was like the last time it was checked was by cam


[16-Aug-20 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
we dont check hinting reports like that anymore


[16-Aug-20 04:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So I can just go through and archive the ones I put on there?


[16-Aug-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000

[16-Aug-20 04:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053

connors had a lot of issues with vcs


[16-Aug-20 06:49 PM] courtney#5125
he supposedly said the n word a while back, bman and i both made announcements on it, but we never did anything i dont believe


[16-Aug-20 06:50 PM] courtney#5125
he was also suspended previously for his comments in vc, which clearly taught him nothing


[16-Aug-20 06:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
This is like the second or third time this has happened


[16-Aug-20 06:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh ive honestly lost count of how many incidents he's been apart of


[16-Aug-20 06:50 PM] courtney#5125
right, and he hasnt learned anything from any of those incidents


[16-Aug-20 06:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
suspension with a firm letter


[16-Aug-20 06:50 PM] Fraux#7971

maya legit gets home not long before the session


[16-Aug-20 06:58 PM] stacey#1000
but I convinced her to come


[16-Aug-20 06:58 PM] Fraux#7971
does that look and seem valid what i was sent


[16-Aug-20 06:58 PM] courtney#5125
can u send the screenshots clarity sent seperately?


[16-Aug-20 06:58 PM] courtney#5125
separately*


[16-Aug-20 06:58 PM] Fraux#7971
yes


[16-Aug-20 06:59 PM] courtney#5125
claritys also kinda shady tho, audreys told me theres been a lot of drama with clarity implying she wants mara, audrey, ashlee, and maybe like one otehr person to leak to her


[16-Aug-20 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
Fraux first MR termination? :))


[16-Aug-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125

[16-Aug-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
actually


[16-Aug-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
admit to leaking..?


[16-Aug-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
just looks like shes doing a sarcastic "ya" when clarity says dont leak


[16-Aug-20 07:00 PM] Fraux#7971
im not ecactly sure but somehow she has that screenshot of staff lounge from mara perspective


[16-Aug-20 07:01 PM] courtney#5125
does she have evidence of mara being the one that sent it to her in dms?


[16-Aug-20 07:01 PM] Fraux#7971
i asked


[16-Aug-20 07:01 PM] Fraux#7971
ok so IDK WHAT TO DO FOR JESS

[16-Aug-20 07:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
As soon as u go meeting room it's bingo cuz u wouldn't take everyone to the meeting room to publicly confront a manager!

[16-Aug-20 07:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think falsely kicking a trainee works well


[16-Aug-20 07:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Lets see if she has to kick anyone


[16-Aug-20 07:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
And if so, we can use that as reference


[16-Aug-20 07:09 PM] stacey#1000

it says there are no members in this role


[16-Aug-20 07:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
Jess, did you fail Coraxqi?

Why?

I've just received a DM from her and the fail was false, you shouldn't have failed her..

She did perfectly fine and should've been passed. I'm not impressed.

Do you have anything else to say?


[16-Aug-20 07:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
continue that idk, just an idea


[16-Aug-20 07:11 PM] xM_inn#2821

update her roles on the discord


[16-Aug-20 11:27 PM] stacey#1000

[16-Aug-20 11:27 PM] stacey#1000

[16-Aug-20 11:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Sure.


[17-Aug-20 12:53 AM] ethan;#0003

[17-Aug-20 01:09 AM] xM_inn#2821

[17-Aug-20 12:03 PM] courtney#5125
claritys been causing a lot of drama with mara and audrey, idk abt her being a very reliable source but thats just my opinion


[17-Aug-20 12:08 PM] courtney#5125
also im going to blacklist aystellz (amqie) for leaking mr rules and admitting to trolling, bypassing, and report farming on alts as an mr/lr. hopefully thats all good


[17-Aug-20 12:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Due to her being a former she thought it was okay......


[17-Aug-20 12:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
:ConfusedCat:


[17-Aug-20 12:08 PM] courtney#5125
theres no proof that mara even leaked anyways tho


[17-Aug-20 12:09 PM] courtney#5125
claritys always been kind of a problem starter, idk abt her but eeeeeehhhhhhhh


[17-Aug-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
There is a screenshot of the staff lounge photo that was sent with maras name and tag as if it was her discord


[17-Aug-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
Seems highly likely it was her


[17-Aug-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
She needs to be suspended for questioning


[17-Aug-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
Can’t ignore that report


[17-Aug-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
Sure clarity can be untrustworthy but that doesn’t mean the report is false. We’ve gotten real info out of cbs we don’t trust that got MRs terminated before

[17-Aug-20 03:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
maybe its just us cuz i haven't seen other people complain


[17-Aug-20 03:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
maybe they cant handle our amount of users in the group?


[17-Aug-20 04:21 PM] stacey#1000
I hope roblox fixes ranking soon


[17-Aug-20 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
otherwise im gonna have to stop hosting


[17-Aug-20 04:22 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Aug-20 04:22 PM] stacey#1000

Group Members Search Returning No Results
Experiencing the same bug. Can’t add one of my admins to the group payroll nor search them up.       Tried having them leave/rejoin the group to see if that’d fix it but to no avail.
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/O4fWSAtSMF7ovzq-ON3nCuY8v5RQXPXtrN30TOBWttw/https/devforum.roblox.com/uploads/default/original/4X/2/e/5/2e58ad74e156f3f3aa4f82a2250f18fd402a61cd.png


[17-Aug-20 07:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok so I can't rank anyone in my personal group so it must just be a Roblox-wide issue. Until it's fixed, I don't think we should cancel sessions, but rather inform everyone that there will be an indefinite delay in ranking due to the issues. We could make a temporary trello and store everyone that needs ranking on there. That way, we're minimalizing any effect to our operations.

The second option is to cancel sessions however that is going to cause a few problems and no other Roblox groups are doing that at the moment. However, in order to do this, you're going to need approval from Baby and Bear. I personally think option one suits is better, but whatever you guys think. Just trying to minimize as many problems as possible; cancelling sessions can cause interest in general-discussion, etc.


[17-Aug-20 07:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Hilton Founder What are your thoughts? Any idea when Roblox might be fixing the issue?


[17-Aug-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
Can we get applications closed until it's fixed?


[17-Aug-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn what do you think about applications tho


[17-Aug-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
if that stays open we will get hundreds of passed ones that cant get ranked and it will be an overlode


[17-Aug-20 07:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Just see how it goes ig


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
For all we know, it could be fixed by tomorrow


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
If its not fixed tomorrow Im not planning any more sessions


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
If it isn't fixed within 24 hours, we can re-evaluate


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
I will still host the ones I have planned


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
but not planning any other ones until its fixed


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
because then Ill keep getting more and more people to rank


[17-Aug-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
and thats a lot

You're given access to the alliance channel of whatever alliance you're assigned to. You basically need to represent as a Bloxton official and you're responsible for announcing their events in #ally-announcements and dealing with any of their inquiries.

[18-Aug-20 04:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[18-Aug-20 04:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[18-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Hopefully Roblox fixes it soon it’s been what 2 days now?


[18-Aug-20 04:23 PM] Fraux#7971
yes 2 days


[18-Aug-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Im not hosting anymore trainings


[18-Aug-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Roblox needs to fix itself


[18-Aug-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
What’s the point in hosting if we can’t rank and it will just keep piling up


[18-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Fraux#7971
ya after my training tn im probably done until its fixed


[18-Aug-20 04:31 PM] Fraux#7971
can we put like a card like this on the training trello explaining the issues and how there will be a delay in being ranked if you have passed or soemthing along those lines? (i didnt add that its photoshopped btw)

[18-Aug-20 04:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that actually wouldn’t be a bad idea. if you wanna make one, go for it. @Fraux If you want us to read what you put for it then send it here.


[18-Aug-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
I think we should also excuse seniors form their checklist this week, because if not as many sessions are being hosted it might be harder for people to complete it @Bloo_Berriez


[18-Aug-20 04:44 PM] Fraux#7971
ill send before i post


[18-Aug-20 04:51 PM] Fraux#7971
**Greetings everyone!**


**Currently, we are unable to rank passers from trainings, as well as interviews because of a Roblox group issue. Due to this, there will be an indefinite delay in passers being ranked. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we will be sure to rank any previous passers who have not yet been ranked as soon as we are able to do so. Thank you for your patience!**

[18-Aug-20 05:53 PM] courtney#5125

[18-Aug-20 05:53 PM] courtney#5125
do u suppose she could be considered for a promotion or is that too risky rn?


[18-Aug-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
no she never did


[18-Aug-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
I mean she didnt like a major major concern


[18-Aug-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Aug-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Aug-20 05:54 PM] courtney#5125

:bloxton:  | **COMPLEX GREETINGS & EMOJIS** | :bloxton3: 

Greetings Bloxton community!

**COMPLEXITY**

It has been brought to our attention a previous announcement related so this particular topic was removed, so we feel it is needed to announce it to you all again, as well as inform you all of a new regulation. At the hotel, many of you are using extremely complicated wording in your greetings towards guests, in which a large majority of them would not understand, considering most of them are likely children. There is no need for such complex greetings when you can easily get your point across using one that is simpler. An example of one which is too complex would be: **"Pleasantries! My sobriquet is ______! How ever might I facilitate you on this bewitching day at Bloxton Hotels?"** In place of that, one that is more acceptable would be **"Welcome to Bloxton! My name is ______. How may I help you today?"**  

**EMOJIS**

A new regulation has been added, that being you are **no longer allowed** to use emojis in your greetings. Often times, it can be hard for guests to understand what is being said due to too many emojis crowding the greetings. Please review your current greeting and ensure it is easily understandable and fits the new criteria. Thank you all for your cooperation!

***Fraux***
**Shift Manager**
Bloxton Hotels


[21-Aug-20 03:12 PM] Fraux#7971
can someone read that


[21-Aug-20 03:12 PM] Fraux#7971
and tell me what needs to be changed etc


[21-Aug-20 03:12 PM] Fraux#7971
and if thats even what polk meant


[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
@Fraux add no need for emojis in greetings too


[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] Fraux#7971
none at all?


[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
None


[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
Bear doesn’t want them used I don’t think

[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
You don’t need emojis in a greeting


[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@Fraux does anyone even speak like this though "Pleasantries! My sobriquet is __! How ever might I facilitate you on this bewitching day at Bloxton Hotels?"


[21-Aug-20 03:14 PM] Fraux#7971
you would be surprised


[21-Aug-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
LRs do


[21-Aug-20 03:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I know it's an example but it seems a little excessive dang


[21-Aug-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000

[21-Aug-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
And then some have like 4 emojis in their greetings


[21-Aug-20 03:15 PM] Fraux#7971
yeah a lot of them use crazy wording


[21-Aug-20 03:15 PM] Fraux#7971
that doesnt even make sense too


[21-Aug-20 03:16 PM] babymariobebe#7563
ohh

I dislike the emoji greetings


[21-Aug-20 03:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
You can't speak to someone with Emojis it comes off as like a robot


[21-Aug-20 03:20 PM] Fraux#7971
how is that now

:bloxton:  | **COMPLEX GREETINGS & EMOJIS** | :bloxton3: 

Greetings Bloxton community!

**COMPLEXITY**

It has been brought to our attention a previous announcement related so this particular topic was removed, so we feel it is needed to announce it to you all again. At the hotel, many of you are using extremely complicated wording in your greetings towards guests, in which a large majority of them would not understand, considering most of them are likely children. There is no need for such complex greetings when you can easily get your point across using one that is simpler. An example of one which is too complex would be: **"Pleasantries! My sobriquet is ______! How ever might I facilitate you on this bewitching day at Bloxton Hotels?"** In place of that, one that is more acceptable would be **"Welcome to Bloxton! My name is ______. How may I help you today?"**  

**EMOJIS**

It is recommended to not use emojis in your greetings. Often times, it can be hard for guests to understand what is being said due to too many emojis crowding the greetings. Please review your current greeting and ensure it is easily understandable and fits the new criteria. Thank you all for your cooperation!

[21-Aug-20 03:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I wouldnt prohibit emojis


[21-Aug-20 03:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I'd make it a recommendation @Fraux


[21-Aug-20 03:22 PM] Fraux#7971
gotcha


[21-Aug-20 03:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
People will listen if you just recommend it, but these days if its like prohibited they feel forced to obey


[21-Aug-20 03:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
You'll get a bunch of people doing emojis in greetings on purpose, lots of haters these days

Emma was owner and while I'm sure she wouldn't do anything bad with it


[21-Aug-20 10:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
Still a security threat


[21-Aug-20 10:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
So I deleted all the stuff and copied it to my own private sheets


[21-Aug-20 10:18 PM] Fraux#7971
we should re-do it with new codes bc tbh i would’ve forgotten my code


[21-Aug-20 10:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes


[21-Aug-20 10:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
If we're doing that


[21-Aug-20 10:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
We should incorporate it with this annuncement

[22-Aug-20 04:49 PM] impact#0297
@bonnie591 why do you have levels of roles for your office


[22-Aug-20 04:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
everyone wanted me to make a key so i finally made one but i made memberships as trust levels so i can control which levels can enter my office


[22-Aug-20 04:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
e.g if i want to talk level 3+ only


[22-Aug-20 04:50 PM] impact#0297
who is everyone


[22-Aug-20 04:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
mrs who have the role


[22-Aug-20 04:51 PM] impact#0297
I just think it's really stupid to be quite honest with you


[22-Aug-20 04:51 PM] courtney#5125
thats bonnie for u 😄

oop


[22-Aug-20 04:51 PM] impact#0297
Bonnie, if you want specific people to have access to your office, just give them individual powers in the office?


[22-Aug-20 04:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
that would be a lot of permission changing sir


[22-Aug-20 04:51 PM] impact#0297
Instead of making a role, which is public, and arguably shows favoritism.


[22-Aug-20 04:52 PM] impact#0297
And then you make "levels" on top of it?


[22-Aug-20 04:52 PM] impact#0297
That's a lot of permission changing..


[22-Aug-20 04:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
its just for my office not really favouritism


[22-Aug-20 04:53 PM] impact#0297
why do you have 3 levels


[22-Aug-20 04:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
level 1: basic access to my office (you can view it and join it)

level 2: individuals i trust more personally and have more access to my office (fyi level 1 and 2 access can be revoked)

level 3: most trust and will be able to join when i speak


[22-Aug-20 04:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
if u dont want me to have 3 levels i can delete them for just one key


[22-Aug-20 04:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
but this is just the method i wanted for my office


[22-Aug-20 04:56 PM] impact#0297
yea like I get the keys for polk and bloos office


[22-Aug-20 04:56 PM] impact#0297
but I really don't get the levels


[22-Aug-20 04:57 PM] impact#0297
like really, a role to just see & join your office?


[22-Aug-20 04:57 PM] impact#0297
and then level 2, is the.. exact same thing?


[22-Aug-20 04:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
level 2 might be the most useless one - just got access to my office when i dont want regular level 1s joining for whatever reason


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] impact#0297
i think you took your voice reveal thing just a little too far bonnie


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] impact#0297
just have an access key role


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] impact#0297
that can be equivalent to your level 3


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@bonnie591 Let's just do 1 office key like Minn and Bloo, I dont really see a need for more than 1 access key


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
alright if thats what u want


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I dont want to flood the roles and such


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont have a problem with it i just felt like it would be cool to have membership levels


[22-Aug-20 04:59 PM] babymariobebe#7563
But if you need one for access then that's ok


[22-Aug-20 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
can someone help me create an office key for me


[22-Aug-20 05:03 PM] Polk#1596

You have the rights to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can’t afford one, one will be provided to you.


[22-Aug-20 05:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
With these rights in mind do you wish to speak with us? @courtney

Kicked her for doing "It" instead of "It's"


[23-Aug-20 06:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
That's super harsh imo


[23-Aug-20 09:40 AM] courtney#5125
right, that girl should’ve been named done


[23-Aug-20 09:41 AM] courtney#5125
ughhhh we’ve had sooo many announcements abt not being too strict on grammar. they just keep doing what they have been doing, being too harsh :/


[23-Aug-20 09:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
the thing is


[23-Aug-20 09:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
the person was named done


[23-Aug-20 09:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
and another MR kicked her instead


[23-Aug-20 09:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
i dont get why though, that is literally so small


[23-Aug-20 09:45 AM] courtney#5125
bruhhh


[23-Aug-20 09:46 AM] courtney#5125
lyss has mentioned to me several times, that even though her grammar test has remained the same and it’s a simple test (as they should be), more often than not, she ends up with less than 10, and sometimes only around 5, interviewees. and that’s normally with a very full server. the MRs just kick for the smallest things


[23-Aug-20 09:47 AM] courtney#5125
her test is  like “Hi, welcome to Bloxton Hotels! How may I help you today?” or smthg similar to that I’m not sure


[23-Aug-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
honestly its frustrating cause isnt it common sense to be not that cruel.


[23-Aug-20 09:48 AM] courtney#5125
we’re trying to employ them, yeah


[23-Aug-20 09:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
and those ppl could be little kids as well, they only want a chance!


[23-Aug-20 09:48 AM] courtney#5125
it’s superrrr frustrating when MRs think “Blox-Ton” is incorrect


[23-Aug-20 09:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
anyways, we should bring that up in the meeting


[23-Aug-20 09:48 AM] courtney#5125
yeah agreed


[23-Aug-20 09:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
we need a new solution of some sort


[23-Aug-20 09:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
THEY KICK PPL WHO SAY BLOX-TON?


[23-Aug-20 09:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
Wow that's.. interesting.. why would u kick for that LOL


[23-Aug-20 09:49 AM] courtney#5125
it’s hard for hosts to moderate every single interviewee’s answer, the MRs need to be informed themselves


[23-Aug-20 09:49 AM] courtney#5125
I DONT KNOW MIN. I SEE BLOX, AND I SEE TON. WHATS THE ISSUE


[23-Aug-20 09:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ya, I only saw that cuz amira stood out as she's a former MR


[23-Aug-20 09:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
God knows how many others were falsely kicked


[23-Aug-20 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
LOL


[23-Aug-20 09:50 AM] courtney#5125
yeahhh 😔😔😔


[23-Aug-20 09:50 AM] Fraux#7971
Courtney kicks every single interviewee for no reason can u pls fire her


[23-Aug-20 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oh? Rumour has it u do that fraux.. not candy


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] courtney#5125
it’s so frustrating to watch an interviewee get it right, and an MR is reading it, and ur like ok good! they got it right, now name them done so we can do rules. THEN THEY GET KICKED FHSISKAND


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] Fraux#7971
Ummm.. I think u have ur facts confused


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
Umm.. I think ur.. fired!


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] Fraux#7971
Ummm... No 💖


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
IKR CANDY


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
Its even more frustrating they've been named done and then kicked


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] courtney#5125
good, now can we blacklist him for making false claims 😃👍


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
That's not only annoying for me as a host, but imagine how the poor person feels


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
MUST BE A TEASE


[23-Aug-20 09:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yep for sure


[23-Aug-20 09:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
Blacklisted too, pack ur bags @Fraux


[23-Aug-20 09:52 AM] courtney#5125
or when u have a rlly small server already, and ur just hoping for enough interviewees to actually have a session, and then  the MRs kick 8/10 of the guests bc they “got it wrong”


[23-Aug-20 09:52 AM] courtney#5125
@Fraux good riddance


[23-Aug-20 09:55 AM] Fraux#7971
omg yay!!!!


[23-Aug-20 10:23 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Did I tell you guys the time I went to interviews and I had everything else correct except "It's"


[23-Aug-20 10:23 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I put Its. and got kicked


[23-Aug-20 10:23 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But then I went again and someone made that mistake and got to stay.

dot spam is a good example


[23-Aug-20 07:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah that should be a warning ngl


[23-Aug-20 07:29 PM] Fraux#7971
yeah not a demotion


[23-Aug-20 07:29 PM] stacey#1000
i mean if its a hotel guest spamming 10+ times


[23-Aug-20 07:29 PM] stacey#1000
you would perm ban


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
so why should spamming 10+ times be different for staff?


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
they clearly know the rules


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
of no spamming


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
If its less than 10 times


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
I agree with suspension


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
but i think if its 10+ times


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
should be fired and banned


[23-Aug-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
21 times is a lot


[23-Aug-20 07:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
if its intentional and meant to troll / cause harm then yes fire but ive been reviewing suspensions and fires recently and a lot of people are getting fired and banned for spamming something 5 times


[23-Aug-20 07:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
thing is with hotel guests spamming 10+ times is we dont have anything else we can really do as a consequence except a kick and server ban

with staff we can suspend/fire first without a ban which will still give them a fair consequence


[23-Aug-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
if its spamming 10+ times I still think it should be fired and banned


[23-Aug-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
because just because they are staff they shouldnt get special treatment


[23-Aug-20 07:35 PM] courtney#5125
also I’ve seen ppl get banned for just doing a bunch of dots before. can we make sure seniors aren’t banning for that at banning sessions


[23-Aug-20 07:36 PM] courtney#5125
unless it’s like


[23-Aug-20 07:36 PM] courtney#5125
obviously with malicious intent


[23-Aug-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok if its spamming 10+ times then maybe fire and ban but if its spamming dots i still dont think ban


[23-Aug-20 07:36 PM] courtney#5125
I’ve seen ppl get banned for doing 5 dogs after they say something :/


[23-Aug-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
^^ malicious intent


[23-Aug-20 07:36 PM] courtney#5125

[23-Aug-20 07:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what about greetings what if someone spams their greeting


[23-Aug-20 07:40 PM] courtney#5125
shut it bonnie


[23-Aug-20 07:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
i saw someone spam their greeting like 5 times and on the proof they were like "Hello?" so they were probably just being a little nooby and spamming a guest with their greetings


[23-Aug-20 07:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think that would be suspension worthy tho like 5 day should do the job


[23-Aug-20 07:51 PM] courtney#5125
and a lot of times mrs think staff members are spamming their greeting when they look in chatlogs, but really they mightve had to say it 4 or 5 times if guests walk away without needing anything


[23-Aug-20 08:41 PM] Fraux#7971
@courtney ya like sometimes ill do my greeting and ppl will walk opposite way and that’ll occur a few times


[23-Aug-20 08:42 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] ethan;#0003
he posted a tiktok


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] ethan;#0003
and didnt reallize it had the word ass in it


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
umm thats very unfair


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] ethan;#0003
and the mrs are acting like they have nerver cursed before...


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
some people dont even classify "ass" as swearing


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] ethan;#0003
they witch hunt people down who curse in general


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] ethan;#0003
and the word "shitpost"


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] ethan;#0003
that isnt cursing


[24-Aug-20 02:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
and if it was accidental, a warning would suffice at the most

[24-Aug-20 02:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
im gonna unban flyro


[24-Aug-20 02:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
we can sort a solution to this rule in the meeting


[24-Aug-20 02:29 AM] ethan;#0003
when is the next meeting


[24-Aug-20 02:29 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Saturday potentially


[24-Aug-20 02:29 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Cyto has to decide


[24-Aug-20 02:29 AM] ethan;#0003
so many innocent people have been banned for accidently sending a meme or image or video that has a curse in it


[24-Aug-20 02:30 AM] ethan;#0003
and 99% of the time NOBODY else in general notices


[24-Aug-20 02:30 AM] ethan;#0003
except MR's going on witch hunts


[24-Aug-20 02:30 AM] ethan;#0003
trying to find people that should get banned


[24-Aug-20 02:30 AM] ethan;#0003
in the case of flyro, nobody noticed


[24-Aug-20 02:30 AM] ethan;#0003
not one LR who was talking


[24-Aug-20 02:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
the whole banning for video swearing should only be applicable if the video is vulgar and was intentionally posted to cause disturbance or is inappropriate


[24-Aug-20 02:31 AM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[24-Aug-20 02:31 AM] ethan;#0003
because people have said in the past its unfair that mrs get to curse


[24-Aug-20 02:31 AM] ethan;#0003
and lrs dont


[24-Aug-20 02:31 AM] ethan;#0003
like they say why arent mrs banned


[24-Aug-20 02:32 AM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn did u unban flyro?


[24-Aug-20 02:33 AM] xM_inn#2821

haptic suits are whack


[24-Aug-20 09:17 AM] courtney#5125
i mean sometimes i feel like swearing should only be a warning and delete, depending on what’s said. if someone accidentally curses or says something minor, like “I have a shit-ton of homework to do”, they could be warned and their message could be deleted. if someone is repeatedly swearing or spamming a curse word, obviously their intention is clear, so we’d ban. that could just be too complicated tho, so idk


[24-Aug-20 09:55 AM] Polk#1596
personally, i feel like bloxton has a "family friendly" approach to things


[24-Aug-20 09:56 AM] Polk#1596
just because discord is 13+ does not mean that their parents could restrict them from being in servers that has cursing in them


[24-Aug-20 09:56 AM] courtney#5125
thats a good point too


[24-Aug-20 09:56 AM] Polk#1596
therefore, to make things easier, i think cursing should still be a ban no matter the situation, except if it is truly an accident


[24-Aug-20 09:57 AM] Polk#1596
but this should be up to baby


[24-Aug-20 09:57 AM] courtney#5125
and some ppl may just be completely uncomfortable with seeing people swear, whether it be religion or just personal morals


[24-Aug-20 09:57 AM] Polk#1596
yes


[24-Aug-20 09:57 AM] courtney#5125
yes polk i agree


[24-Aug-20 09:57 AM] Polk#1596
and i dont think its hard to follow not to swear, its not something that everyone needs in their lives


[24-Aug-20 09:57 AM] Polk#1596
follow the rule about not swearing*


[24-Aug-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
and how do people know that mrs get to swear


[24-Aug-20 09:58 AM] courtney#5125
and if they cant control their mouth then maybe they shouldnt be talking in general at all


[24-Aug-20 09:58 AM] courtney#5125
yeah, unless formers have said something idk


[24-Aug-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
yes


[24-Aug-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
oh yeah i forgot about leakers


[24-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Polk#1596
well i mean, i dont mind prohibiting them from swearing as well


[24-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Polk#1596
but it literally says


[24-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Polk#1596
they can swear to a limit


[24-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Polk#1596
its not a full on cursing competition


[24-Aug-20 10:00 AM] courtney#5125

im sure nothing can be done at this point, i was just curious


[24-Aug-20 10:02 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey we might be able ti figure out when it was taken


[24-Aug-20 10:02 PM] ethan;#0003
because we can compare when the cards where added to the board


[24-Aug-20 10:02 PM] ethan;#0003
because the losts look short

yes but still got no clue who it is


[24-Aug-20 10:03 PM] stacey#1000

it could be someone recent considering we havent had a manager leak for awhile or at least not that we know of


[24-Aug-20 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
someone close to cbs and such


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
idk who is close with cbs thats a manager


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] courtney#5125
marissa is one


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] courtney#5125
but i just


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
ya but i dont think she would leak


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] courtney#5125
im not sure she doesnt strike me as one that would leak


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
considering she tells us stuff to report that


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] courtney#5125
shes been a manager for a very long time and always reports cb stuff to us yes


[24-Aug-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
I doubt its her


[24-Aug-20 10:10 PM] courtney#5125
idk any other managers that are close with cbs


[24-Aug-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; make the list on the HR board


[24-Aug-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Aug-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
so managers dont see


[24-Aug-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Aug-20 10:26 PM] ethan;#0003
it happened between 11:40 pm est and 4:30 am est


[24-Aug-20 10:27 PM] courtney#5125
from the 22nd-23rd?


[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] Fraux#7971
@ethan; last night going into this morning or yesterday morning


[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
ayeshavqx was promoted over a week ago I dont think its her but idk


[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] ethan;#0003
this morning


[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] Fraux#7971
if i promoted a leaker i quit


[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] ethan;#0003

[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] ethan;#0003
im going to do the same thing for interview ban reqs


[24-Aug-20 10:28 PM] ethan;#0003
since its short


[24-Aug-20 10:29 PM] Fraux#7971
k im looking at actions during that time so i can see if maybe there were any accidental card movings so we can see who was online at that time


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
so it happened not long after cheif was promoted?


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
right question u three


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
would you say security is the most popular choice for trainees at ur sessions


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
no


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
what would it be


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
bartender


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] Fraux#7971
services are pretty popular


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
do you have a shortage of head of securities


[24-Aug-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
no


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000
because other heads are usually there


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000
to train it


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
but you have a shortage of head of securities


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
as theres none there


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000
I just promoted someone to rank 8 yesterday if that helps


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] bonnie591#0591

[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000
I get rank 8s at my session


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
its this big gap


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
now i dont mind head of services having more than double head of security since its two ranks and popular


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000
the thing is there is not many people I know that deserve rank 8


[24-Aug-20 10:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
but 13 is very low


[24-Aug-20 10:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
mhm


[24-Aug-20 10:32 PM] stacey#1000
we cant promote people with safechat so


[24-Aug-20 10:32 PM] ethan;#0003
the scren shot was taken between 4:30 am and 6:30 am


[24-Aug-20 10:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
receptionist is just dying its rare i see anytone training


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] Fraux#7971
@ethan; so how many hours ago is that


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
im gonna promote james tomorrow via dms im not gonna make him wait to the end of the week for a session by me


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] Fraux#7971
ok so 3:30 to 5:30 for me


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] Fraux#7971
10:33 rn so....


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
14-17 hours ago


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] stacey#1000
so cheif was a manager


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] stacey#1000
when it happened


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] ethan;#0003
what is cheifs timezone


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] Fraux#7971
ok


[24-Aug-20 10:33 PM] courtney#5125
pst


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
id had to throw cheif into a suspension right away after shes promoted


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
im not planning to do this but would you all be totally against letting heads switch ranks if we urgently need them at some point


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
but like its kinds sus there was a leaker right after she was promoted


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
no


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
I dont see why they would need to switch ranks


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
all heads can train security


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] Fraux#7971
uh what bonnie can you explain


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] courtney#5125
in what situation would we need them to switch


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
also is anyone against me asking baby to up the rank number things so head of security and services dont have to share a role


[24-Aug-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
if there is no rank 8 at a session a rank 10 can train it


[24-Aug-20 10:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
like if we had less than 5 head of securities ever


[24-Aug-20 10:35 PM] stacey#1000
i dont see it that big of a deal when other heads train security and do the same thing


[24-Aug-20 10:35 PM] stacey#1000
all heads are the same basically


[24-Aug-20 10:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
if it ever goes 5 or lower and we cant find more securities then it may be something to consider, just an idea


[24-Aug-20 10:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont think it would be too good though


[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] ethan;#0003

[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] Fraux#7971
hmm i dont think that's really needed


[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] ethan;#0003
she was sleeping i think


[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] courtney#5125
yeah not to mention none of them really like to train their own rank anyways, since they do it sooo often, so ik they appreciate it when they get to train another rank, so i cant imagine an instance where we'd need to make them switch


[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] Fraux#7971
@ethan; split up management and see who was online between those hours?


[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] courtney#5125
@ethan; yes she told me she had just woken up early at that time to attend my session this morning


[24-Aug-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
check who was online on roblox at that time


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] Fraux#7971
how


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] ethan;#0003
she woke up at 6 am to go to a bloxton session...


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] ethan;#0003
that doesnt sound like someone who would leak ngl


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] courtney#5125
she wanted mine to be her first one too


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] Fraux#7971
rip my trello is only letting me go 14 hours back


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i cant imagine her leaking


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
ok im going to bed i work tomorrow but ya keep investigating the leaker thing cause the last thing we want is to promote a manger to senior that leaked


[24-Aug-20 10:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
throwback to when head of services was struggling 😳


[24-Aug-20 10:38 PM] Fraux#7971
honestly 13 head of sec really isnt bad


[24-Aug-20 10:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Isn’t Uni fairly close with CBS


[24-Aug-20 10:38 PM] courtney#5125
yes bloo!


[24-Aug-20 10:38 PM] stacey#1000
ya


[24-Aug-20 10:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Hmmm


[24-Aug-20 10:38 PM] stacey#1000
but she reports stuff to us


[24-Aug-20 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
like alistelle does


[24-Aug-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
wait she does


[24-Aug-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
?


[24-Aug-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
un?


[24-Aug-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
uni*


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] courtney#5125
ig ive never seen a report from her


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] courtney#5125
then


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Did you message funt? @Fraux


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] Fraux#7971
no


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
> honestly 13 head of sec really isnt bad
@Fraux not really when you look at the fact we have a million members


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] Fraux#7971
true but its only a little less than the head of services average


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] ethan;#0003
the image wasnt sent through dms


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] ethan;#0003
it was sent in a discord server


[24-Aug-20 10:40 PM] Fraux#7971
head of services has 33 but thats two ranks


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
we've decreased in head receptionists and head of securities over time


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
as we've got more members


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
probably the cb discord server


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
head of services is becoming a lot more popular


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
and all the service ranks


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
sadly I aint in the cb server anymore


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] Fraux#7971
we are pretty good in heads now


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
this is a bad idea


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] courtney#5125
i agree with fraux


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
but what if i tried


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
becoming a fake cb


[24-Aug-20 10:41 PM] Fraux#7971
servers are always full on staff


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
and making random accs to ban myself and then trying to get back in the cb server


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
to get info


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] Fraux#7971
omg i can imagine stacey 💀 



stacey at the hotel:



OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB OMG IM A CB


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
lets at least try to increase of head of security count and be on the look out for securities


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] courtney#5125
9/10 times i get 8 heads at interviews and 4 heads at training. mrs in staff lounge have also made comments about how hard it is to get into servers because of the mass amount of mrs


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] Fraux#7971
Yeah I always hear that too


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] Fraux#7971
And they fill up very early too


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
I always have 4 heads in my server


[24-Aug-20 10:42 PM] courtney#5125
hard to get into servers bc theyre always at max heads*


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
if we were to change head ranks


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
I would say have one head rank


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
and not head of security, services, or reception


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
because they all do the same thing


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] courtney#5125
ya patrick supposedly goes 2 hours before the session is set to begin. kinda excessive but to each their own 👁️ 👄 👁️


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
when they become a head


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
ya i see mrs at my int and training like


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
1 hour


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
before it starts


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] courtney#5125
SPEAKING OF HEADS


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
and im like


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] courtney#5125
and mrs in general


[24-Aug-20 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
why wait that long


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] courtney#5125
can we maybe talk in the meeting about having some sort of mr training when a head gets promoted?


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
change to supervisors


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] Fraux#7971
Personally I don't think we need to fix something that isn't broke


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] courtney#5125
well


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could like combine our head ranks one day if we really wanted to


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] stacey#1000
i think we should tbh


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] courtney#5125
not training but making it mandatory to supervise a session or smthg before attending


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] stacey#1000
legit the heads all do the same thing


[24-Aug-20 10:44 PM] courtney#5125
anyways


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] courtney#5125
i feel like that wouldnt be a very popular decision to combine them all


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
not a bad idea


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
about the training thing


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we have a rank that all lrs can be promoted to then that would make more sense


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
what could we call it


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
we should od that for int too


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
supervisors is one thing


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
make a new mr spectate int


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
before attending one


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
to see how it works


[24-Aug-20 10:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
^


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] Fraux#7971
That's such a good idea yall @courtney @stacey


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
i know when I first became an mr and did my first int


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
i didnt know wtf i was doing


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] courtney#5125
idk i dont like the idea of combining head ranks. i cant imagine it being a popular decision, and its something weve been doing for a long time that has worked and people are fond of...


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
and passed people that shouldve failed the grammar test


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] courtney#5125
LMFAO


[24-Aug-20 10:46 PM] Fraux#7971
@courtney yes like i said earlier i dont think we should fix something that isnt broke


[24-Aug-20 10:47 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i only brought it up bc cheif asked me if there was a manager training or smthg she had to attend bc she thought naming would be hard


[24-Aug-20 10:47 PM] courtney#5125
yes fraux agreed


[24-Aug-20 10:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
head of... ranks made more sense back in 2016 when there was fewer staff


[24-Aug-20 10:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
these days head of security has nothing to do with overseeing security, helping security out


[24-Aug-20 10:48 PM] Fraux#7971
It would be odd having all new rank numbers


[24-Aug-20 10:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
its more like banning cbs at the hotel just like every other mr and training any rank


[24-Aug-20 10:48 PM] courtney#5125
i mean i still think it makes sense, plus its a system a lot of people like


[24-Aug-20 10:48 PM] courtney#5125
i dont want to just think about the convenience of it, id like to think about the appeal of it to everbody else in the group


[24-Aug-20 10:48 PM] courtney#5125
*everybody


[24-Aug-20 10:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm


[24-Aug-20 10:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
also another idea that we could do in future


[24-Aug-20 10:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
it would require baby and bear to dev it


[24-Aug-20 10:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
but maybe something for hrs to view an lrs hotel activity


[24-Aug-20 10:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
e.g u can search someones name and see how active they been in a week or something


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
that would massively help with noticing active people


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] courtney#5125
didnt we talk about something like that at the last meeting?


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] courtney#5125
or maybe that was just for mrs


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
no idea


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] Fraux#7971
Yes as long as it isn't publicly shown like it is at (for example) Panda


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think it was for mrs


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] courtney#5125
the time they spend at the hotel. i dont remember the whole thing


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] Fraux#7971
I just think that's tacky


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
we can easily notice mrs


[24-Aug-20 10:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
its lrs which is a little more tricky


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] courtney#5125
yeah its kinda tacky and i feel like it would become some weird competition if it was public


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] Fraux#7971
if it's ever adopted, needs to be kept a secret 100%


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
just like a gui for hrs where they can see a list of most active today, this week, this month etc


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
and then we can look further into people


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
on the list


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] Fraux#7971
that's not a bad idea


[24-Aug-20 10:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah would be wayyy easier to track LRs activity


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] Fraux#7971
i mean if they're already scripting it for LRs just go the extra mile and add an MR tab


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
If that’s something for only HRs to see


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] courtney#5125
are u guys thinking of it just being private for hrs to see or are u imagining it being public for everyone


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] Fraux#7971
NOT puclic


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] Fraux#7971
public


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
only hrs


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] courtney#5125
ok GOOD


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
definitely not public


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] courtney#5125
then i like it


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
That would be cool


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
Because MRs would leak it


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe seniors since they can submit promo suggestions


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] courtney#5125
yeah facts


[24-Aug-20 10:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
but i think better as hrs only


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] courtney#5125
yeah hrs only


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] courtney#5125
seniors are required to go to the hotel often so they notice mrs enough already, imo


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] Fraux#7971
maybe so but if they were to allow seniors that's a larger probability of that system being leaked


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
^


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and once it’s out there, cant really hide it lol


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] courtney#5125
and if a senior resigns and becomes toxic, then they can spread that the thing even exists and bam the whole plan of it being private is ruined


[24-Aug-20 10:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
i can easily notice mrs even when im inactive


[24-Aug-20 10:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
because u notice the 2 head of services in the server compared to the 15 bartenders


[24-Aug-20 10:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
and if the mr comes to ur session again and again


[24-Aug-20 10:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
its a lot easier to notice


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
is anyone against of changing some settings on the group to allow head of security and services to get their own role


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] ethan;#0003
i have a list of managers who where speaking in sl between 430 and 630 am


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
instead of sharing


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] ethan;#0003
Arty, mia, uni, faith, bryan, ella, lyoo, bex, h0ney, jackson, thebuilder


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] Fraux#7971
head of security dont get their role?


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oop


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] Fraux#7971
i confused


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
is anyone else besides Uni on that list close with CBS


[24-Aug-20 10:55 PM] courtney#5125
wait heads of security and services get their separate rules on the group, dont they?

[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
yes @Bloo_Berriez that is what i was thinking also


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
they share


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] Fraux#7971
oh u mean on disc


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] courtney#5125
OH U MEANT DISCORD HAH


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
noobs


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] courtney#5125
thought u just never looked at the group page before for a sec


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] Fraux#7971
um honestly sometimes i use discord to quickly check what rank some ppl are


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] Fraux#7971
and whenever i see the security/services and i have to go all the way to their profile


[24-Aug-20 10:56 PM] Fraux#7971
i be like 😳


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] courtney#5125
same and then i need to go through the long and TIRING PROCESS of looking up their profile bc i dont remember if theyre head of sec or services 😭


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
I can tell you it ain’t faithfvul


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] courtney#5125
it cant be holly


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] Fraux#7971
omg right courtney


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] courtney#5125
id have a very hard time believing it was her


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] courtney#5125
bryans close with uni and unis close with cbs, but idk


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
Plus it might be a manager that wasn’t talking in channels either


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] ethan;#0003
its not arty, faith, lyoo, bex , or jackson


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] courtney#5125
none of the others on there are close with cbs besides uni i dont think


[24-Aug-20 10:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I doubt it would be but wasn’t H0ney also just promoted to management


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Recently


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Like 2 weeks ago


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] Fraux#7971
@bonnie591 not opposed to that bc whats the difference of head recep havingtheir own role, not fair tbh


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
I was about to say


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] courtney#5125
a week or two ago i think yes bloo


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
I’m a bit sus of h0ney


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] courtney#5125
is h0ney close with cbs at all?


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] Fraux#7971
omg i suggested h0ney it better not be her


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
I think she was in the CB server before but idk


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
I forget


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] courtney#5125
ill see if shes friends with cbs on roblox


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
id have to change bloxlink bindings but it can easily be done


[24-Aug-20 10:58 PM] Fraux#7971
my vote, go for it


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
She’s not


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
I checked


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
No managers are friends with cbs on roblox


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
I think they know we would check that


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] courtney#5125
thats true


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] courtney#5125
fraux have u been able to talk with funt yet


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] courtney#5125
or at least bribe her


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] Fraux#7971
no i unfriended her


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
Funt def won’t tell us


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] Fraux#7971
so i had to add her back


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
rip


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] courtney#5125
well maybe if fraux convinces her if he friends her


[24-Aug-20 10:59 PM] Fraux#7971
and she sleeping i think she is from out of country


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] stacey#1000
Well on the bright side no HRs have ever leaked!!!!


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] stacey#1000
And we know it ain’t a senior too


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] courtney#5125
great job team really going places


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] courtney#5125
yeah it ocouldnt be a senior


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I trust all the seniors, I mean at least I do


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] stacey#1000
What about rat_elijah


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmmm


[24-Aug-20 11:00 PM] courtney#5125
elijahs really quiet


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] stacey#1000
He’s only friends with 2 people on roblox


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Fraux#7971
rat is VERY quiet


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes I was about to say


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Fraux#7971
he scares me


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] courtney#5125
i find it hard to believe itd be him though


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] ethan;#0003
its not elijah


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] courtney#5125
he doesnt friend ppl for a reason


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Fraux#7971
like im actually scared of him


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Fraux#7971
idk his time zone he doesnt have a roe


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] ethan;#0003
he has lots of anxiety from what i know


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Fraux#7971
and i feel like hes a pilgrim bc of his pilgrim hat


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] stacey#1000
I wish we knew their timezone


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Fraux#7971
i associate him with thanksfiving


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] ethan;#0003
he left the discord for like a month because he felt unwelcomed


[24-Aug-20 11:01 PM] courtney#5125
its not bc hes like suspicious or anything i think its from either anxiety or having parents that know hes on roblox and want him to only friend people he knows IM NOT SURE


[24-Aug-20 11:02 PM] stacey#1000
What managers are inactive and quiet


[24-Aug-20 11:02 PM] courtney#5125
thought he mentioned something to a few ppl when they asked to friend him but i dont remember his exact answer


[24-Aug-20 11:02 PM] Fraux#7971
i dont think he's sus he just honestly scares me hes so mysterious 💀


[24-Aug-20 11:02 PM] courtney#5125
he just said he couldnt friend them


[24-Aug-20 11:02 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Aug-20 11:03 PM] ethan;#0003

[24-Aug-20 11:03 PM] courtney#5125
Sarahqxy is SarahTiaPlayz


[24-Aug-20 11:03 PM] courtney#5125
OhhhhhhHHHH yeah right


[24-Aug-20 11:03 PM] courtney#5125
Sarah's mostly quiet


[24-Aug-20 11:04 PM] courtney#5125
not SURE


[24-Aug-20 11:04 PM] stacey#1000
I still think it’s a more recent manager


[24-Aug-20 11:04 PM] stacey#1000
Considering we’ve had no issues with managers leaking until now


[24-Aug-20 11:04 PM] courtney#5125
yeahh


[24-Aug-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
I’m probably wrong but what if a managers trello got hacked


[24-Aug-20 11:05 PM] courtney#5125
thatd be a very scary situation


[24-Aug-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
They would tell us tho


[24-Aug-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
So


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
it could be uni


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
she was online


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
that time

[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] courtney#5125
the pretty recent managers are: alexxyc, Iameizzy, H0neymi1k, ayeshavqx, roxieisog, THEBUILDER58, and jv_lia


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
dought its alexxyc


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] courtney#5125
but i doubt itd be alex, izzy, or builder bc theyre all pretty trusted at other groups


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
she is like an sr at frappe


[24-Aug-20 11:06 PM] courtney#5125
and have mr/hr ranks there


[24-Aug-20 11:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’ve always been sus of uni after hearing how close she is with CBs


[24-Aug-20 11:07 PM] courtney#5125
yes


[24-Aug-20 11:07 PM] courtney#5125
and not to mention shes had leaking issues ever since she became a manager


[24-Aug-20 11:07 PM] courtney#5125
she tends to (or at least she used to) brag about how close she was with cbs :/


[24-Aug-20 11:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[24-Aug-20 11:07 PM] stacey#1000
She also wrote a whole essay about the cb rule we made about appealing


[24-Aug-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
To get it changed


[24-Aug-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
Because she felt bad for them

[24-Aug-20 11:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Also should we revamp the management board, most of the lists are outdated and were used back in 2017 or 1980


[24-Aug-20 11:13 PM] Fraux#7971
Yeah that's rly sus


[24-Aug-20 11:13 PM] Fraux#7971

[24-Aug-20 11:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
fr a lot of the cards on management board were made from like 2018 and early 2019 lol


[24-Aug-20 11:15 PM] stacey#1000
I legit don’t think it’s her


[24-Aug-20 11:15 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Aug-20 11:15 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Aug-20 11:15 PM] stacey#1000
Idk tho


[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] courtney#5125
are we still suspending her when shes onlineee then or


[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk, she just really puts it out there that shes in close contact with these cbs so its like who is it, like idk any other manager thats like that atm


[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] courtney#5125
right, and she said she was good friends with funterrible just 10 days ago


[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] stacey#1000
If you really want to suspend her rn idc


[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Aug-20 11:16 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Aug-20 11:17 PM] stacey#1000
Rip


[24-Aug-20 11:17 PM] courtney#5125
shes made it a habit to flaunt her friendships with cbs, clearly funterrible is a good friend too, and shes kinda been problematic with leaking since she got management


[24-Aug-20 11:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

I'm going on a small trip for a few days so I cant really help


[25-Aug-20 03:03 AM] xM_inn#2821
What if ya'll made an announcement to managers about CBs in an effort to try and make them leak it so we can find out what time zone the leaker is


[25-Aug-20 03:03 AM] xM_inn#2821
At least then we'd have something to work off


[25-Aug-20 03:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
Its clearly a current manager but definitely not a senior cuz seniors have loads more that they could leak

@xM_inn we suspect it might be uni considering she brags she’s close with cbs and has said she is close with funt so we wanted to suspend her for questioning. But I don’t think it’s her


[25-Aug-20 04:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
Theres not enough proof to make her an official suspect yet


[25-Aug-20 04:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'd recommend not suspending yet, hold off


[25-Aug-20 04:49 AM] xM_inn#2821

[25-Aug-20 08:53 AM] courtney#5125
doqee has had several issues in the past with his comments in general discussion. i believe i said something in hr-announcements a while back, but i don’t think anything happened to him


[25-Aug-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000

And also I’m putting him up on inactive seniors


[25-Aug-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000
So he can be sent a thing


[25-Aug-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000
Since it’s been over 2 weeks and he should very well know to make a notice

[25-Aug-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
Incase someone else is leaked


[25-Aug-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003

hi stacey


[25-Aug-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
your choice but I really don’t think it’s a good idea to promote someone to manager when there is a leaker on the manager team


[25-Aug-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
But like we also don’t have anything to go off of really to find who it is


[25-Aug-20 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont really want to hold back james more hm


[25-Aug-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
I mean you can promote your choice cause I got no ideas to find the management leaker


[25-Aug-20 02:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok ill go ahead ith it

awww holly ):


[25-Aug-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
If we wait 4-5 weeks holly will be gone most likely


[25-Aug-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
I’m gonna try to convince her by saying I’m planning a random huge theme session and I want her to stay for it


[25-Aug-20 03:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
who holly? sorry i get all these names mixed up


[25-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
I think I convinced her to stay until at least October


[25-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
Which should be enough time for us to get a senior vote in


[25-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
Holly is faithfvul


[25-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000

[25-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I convinced her to stay until October


[25-Aug-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000

She is getting bored of management


[25-Aug-20 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
And I can understand that given she’s been one for so long


[25-Aug-20 04:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
To make things more interactive, what if we just gave badges to MRs. You can have a the [1] typical badge or a [2] badge with your character thumbnail on it, but to get your character on your badge, on picture day
HRs use a camera setup to take a picture of individuals that want the character thumbnail on their badge. Datastore saves that a HR took a picture of them, and then every time they join the hotel they get [2] badge and use roblox api to get a character thumbnail and just put it on the badge.


[25-Aug-20 04:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
idk just an idea.


[25-Aug-20 04:18 PM] Fraux#7971
what


[25-Aug-20 04:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
This is brought out on picture day. 

If any MR wants to get their character on a in game provided badge, a HR takes a picture of them using this on picture day.

A user named "Unethhical" wanted to appeal,  I told them to wait atleast a month cuz they had recently been banned. I forgot to reply to them, and they sent a video of a turkey picture and a real ball sack as the  caruncle of the turkey.


[25-Aug-20 07:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[25-Aug-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000

[25-Aug-20 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
no minn said not to suspend


[25-Aug-20 09:24 PM] courtney#5125
yeah there isn’t enough proof to prove it was her!


[25-Aug-20 10:38 PM] Fraux#7971
ok so


[25-Aug-20 10:39 PM] Fraux#7971
earlier the CBS sent me pics of whoever did the leaking but ofc the video wouldn’t load so i closed disc to try to reload and then they deleted it when i got back on


[25-Aug-20 10:40 PM] Fraux#7971
but i caught a glimpse of the pfp and i faintly remember it but i think it was almost a weird pastel thing


[25-Aug-20 10:41 PM] Fraux#7971
and i looked at unis pfp and her is is pastelish and i kinda think there is resemblance but i really can’t remember


[25-Aug-20 10:43 PM] Fraux#7971
i honestly don’t know and i can’t remember and UGH THEY WONT SEND IT

[25-Aug-20 11:33 PM] stacey#1000
Is the person still there leaking?


[25-Aug-20 11:33 PM] stacey#1000
Because I got an idea


[25-Aug-20 11:33 PM] Fraux#7971
whats the idea


[25-Aug-20 11:35 PM] stacey#1000
If the person is still there leaking staff lounge chats


[25-Aug-20 11:35 PM] Fraux#7971
i had to pban bc of spamming but they r coming on alts


[25-Aug-20 11:35 PM] stacey#1000
Take away aivdans roles temporary so he can’t access the mr channels


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
And see if the leaking stops


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] Fraux#7971
oo


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
He’s the suspect


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] Fraux#7971
they need to come back


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
If they come back and do it again


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
Take away his roles


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
And be like, got anything else to say?


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
And see if it stops


[25-Aug-20 11:36 PM] stacey#1000
If it continues we know it’s not aivdan


[25-Aug-20 11:39 PM] stacey#1000
If it stopped next time it happens we can do that


[25-Aug-20 11:39 PM] Fraux#7971
they wont tell me


[25-Aug-20 11:40 PM] stacey#1000
So you took away his roles and they stopped or?


[25-Aug-20 11:40 PM] Fraux#7971

[25-Aug-20 11:56 PM] Fraux#7971

[26-Aug-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
Idk what heads that are bst and are offline


[26-Aug-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
Let me see


[26-Aug-20 12:01 AM] Fraux#7971

[26-Aug-20 12:02 AM] ethan;#0003
@stacey do you know maya, megan, and beth snitched on opviton and got his cop alt fired


[26-Aug-20 12:02 AM] Fraux#7971
wym


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] Fraux#7971
what does that mean


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
Yes I know Ethan


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
I mean tbh


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
He had it coming I guess


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
I couldn’t stop them


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] Fraux#7971
what happened


[26-Aug-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
He admitted to acc sharing on his alt


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
While basically being a cb at the same time


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
On Stapleton


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
His main is perm banned


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
And he was a cop on his alt


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
And acc shared on that alt


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] ethan;#0003
thats not cool man


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
Well


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] Fraux#7971
he should have followed rules!


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
Tbh it’s his own fault


[26-Aug-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
He violated many rules


[26-Aug-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
And yes I feel bad for him


[26-Aug-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
But still he had it coming


[26-Aug-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
Like wouldn’t we do the same thing here...?


[26-Aug-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
If he was acc sharing on an alt and was an mr that got fired, and you knew about it you would report him?


[26-Aug-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
It’s the same idea


[26-Aug-20 12:08 AM] Fraux#7971

i said that a week or so ago


[26-Aug-20 12:49 AM] ethan;#0003
she seemed suspicious


[26-Aug-20 12:49 AM] ethan;#0003
due to low follower count


[26-Aug-20 12:49 AM] ethan;#0003
and folloing count


[26-Aug-20 12:49 AM] ethan;#0003
and low acount age

@katie it’s not aivdan but I got an idea


[26-Aug-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
Do what fraux did last night and temp take the roles of a bst mr you find susp so they can’t see the channels and see if it stops


[26-Aug-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
That’s how we know it’s not aivdan


[26-Aug-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
And we think it might be casuallyM


[26-Aug-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
It’s probably someone that’s offline


[26-Aug-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
So if you take her roles temp to see if it stops it might


[26-Aug-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
Just test it out


[26-Aug-20 02:14 PM] Fraux#7971

or anything happen to her?


[26-Aug-20 08:09 PM] courtney#5125
no there isnt enough proof to suspend her right now!


[26-Aug-20 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
i thought she was being suspended and was going to be put under investigation


[26-Aug-20 08:10 PM] courtney#5125
no min decided there wasnt enough evidence to proceed with that


[26-Aug-20 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003

[26-Aug-20 08:33 PM] stacey#1000
Im starting to think its an MR that lied about their timezone to get a different timezone role, doesnt have a timezone role or whatever to throw us off


[26-Aug-20 08:37 PM] Fraux#7971
@stacey that thought ran through my head but i didn’t want it to be true


[26-Aug-20 08:53 PM] courtney#5125

[26-Aug-20 08:59 PM] stacey#1000

me. freaking. either.


[26-Aug-20 09:34 PM] stacey#1000
I got an idea to see what rank it is tho at least


[26-Aug-20 09:34 PM] stacey#1000
take away permissions from rank 9s all at once then see if they can still say whats there or not


[26-Aug-20 09:34 PM] stacey#1000
and so on


[26-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Fraux#7971
good idea but when they get their roles back they will say stuff in SL which will give it away to the leaker


[26-Aug-20 09:43 PM] Fraux#7971
be like what happened and stuff


[27-Aug-20 12:18 AM] KjRBLX#2053

@stacey


[27-Aug-20 08:20 AM] Polk#1596
not sure when this leaking started happening


[27-Aug-20 10:17 AM] stacey#1000
Around the time a lot of people were promoted that one week. Remember we thought it was othue but it wasn’t


[27-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
Around that time


[27-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
So like about a month now


[27-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
I think it could be FarisWheeI


[27-Aug-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
Idk tho


[27-Aug-20 10:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
So Fizze V2 is due tomorrow after literally a year of false promises


[27-Aug-20 10:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
Let's see if it is actually released this time


[27-Aug-20 10:30 AM] courtney#5125
bruh isn’t ar6ana blacklisted


[27-Aug-20 10:30 AM] courtney#5125

[27-Aug-20 10:34 AM] stacey#1000
Idk


[27-Aug-20 11:15 AM] ethan;#0003
The leaker is someone who’s ego is shooting through the roof


[27-Aug-20 11:15 AM] ethan;#0003
And is probs BST


[27-Aug-20 11:16 AM] ethan;#0003
are there any mrs you think of who’s egos are shooting through the roof


[27-Aug-20 11:16 AM] ethan;#0003
1 person I think of is Mirk


[27-Aug-20 11:17 AM] ethan;#0003
But mirk isn’t BST


[27-Aug-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
@stacey ik how we can figure out if it’s a manager or head


[27-Aug-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
Make two announcements


[27-Aug-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
Fake confidential stuff


[27-Aug-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
In manager announcements and staff announcements


[27-Aug-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
If both are leaked it’s a manager


[27-Aug-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
Two more people it could be is Imthetoughest or sagespxace idk his current username


[27-Aug-20 11:21 AM] ethan;#0003
Because we have gotten reports of them in the past


[27-Aug-20 11:21 AM] ethan;#0003
That sagespace was reported to of leaked info after he resigned a year or so ago


[27-Aug-20 11:21 AM] ethan;#0003
And that toughest account shared


[27-Aug-20 11:21 AM] ethan;#0003
But there was no proof to back either up


[27-Aug-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
@ethan; good idea, if you have any idea of what to announce let me know


[27-Aug-20 11:40 AM] courtney#5125
i think erick has also been abusing the warn command by warning other heads/managers in staff lounge, not just himself


[27-Aug-20 11:40 AM] bonnie591#0591
they cant take me seriously so they wont stop when i tell them


[27-Aug-20 11:40 AM] courtney#5125
idk who he warned tho, i just remember him messing around a lot in staff lounge with it


[27-Aug-20 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
You can see he randomly warns himself


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
He needs like an official warning sent to him In DMs


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] courtney#5125
can we give him an official warning AND make an announcement to seniors, since they never listened to bonnie?


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
A written one


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Let’s do that


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] courtney#5125
yes perfect


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll add a vote


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
uh


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
i dont really expect them to listen to my "stop"


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
He should though


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Like you told him to stop


[27-Aug-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
And he didn’t


[27-Aug-20 11:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think u should just give him a verbal warning and tell them to stop


[27-Aug-20 11:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
and not do it in the future


[27-Aug-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
Added the vote


[27-Aug-20 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
I still think an announcement wouldn’t hurt to remind all seniors of their actions tho


[27-Aug-20 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
Like how they are role models for managers and stuff


[27-Aug-20 11:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
if they warn other people maybe


[27-Aug-20 11:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
but themselves uh shouldnt be a written warning


[27-Aug-20 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
Can I still announce tho? @bonnie591


[27-Aug-20 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
Like just a small announcement to seniors


[27-Aug-20 11:44 AM] courtney#5125
whether they didnt think bonnie was serious or not, or just plainly didnt want to listen, he still pinged them all to stop, so it shouldve been obvious that they should listen


[27-Aug-20 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
The warning would be for abusing commands


[27-Aug-20 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
Not warning themselves


[27-Aug-20 11:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah say like only warn if it's valid and only warn Mrs as a joke if u got permission from hr


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
Being unprofessional and abusing commands


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
That’s what the warning would be for


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
Ok ill write up the announcement


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
No warning to erick yet see if he continues after this


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
If he does warn


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
I think if we just made an announcement it would be fine


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
But if he does it after the announcement


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
Then warn


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
Mhm


[27-Aug-20 11:45 AM] stacey#1000
Ok


[27-Aug-20 11:46 AM] Polk#1596
bonnie is not to be taken seriously!


[27-Aug-20 11:46 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll send announcement here for thoughts


[27-Aug-20 11:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
Ur fired @Polk


[27-Aug-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
Make the announcement to managers too cuz they have moderation commands, nobody can say they weren't told then


[27-Aug-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey


[27-Aug-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
Ok


[27-Aug-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
But there hasn’t been issues with managers doing it


[27-Aug-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
It was mainly for seniors because they are role models for managers and by them doing it, it sets bad example


[27-Aug-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
So the announcement was based on that


[27-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ye ik but it might just make sure managers are aware that they cant do it either


[27-Aug-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Up to u


[27-Aug-20 12:00 PM] stacey#1000
If we notice issues with managers doing it in the future then I would but rn it’s not an issue


[27-Aug-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmm alr


[27-Aug-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
Thoughts?


[27-Aug-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
Abusing Moderation Commands

Greetings, Senior Managers. 

Recently, it has been brought to the HR teams attention that some of you have been abusing moderation commands by giving yourself or others false warnings for fun. I would like to
make it very clear that this has NEVER been acceptable and is still unacceptable. 

You should only warn users for VALID reasons, such as if they are violating the rules of the server or not following the proper report format. You should also never warn yourself, because there is no reason to. By warning yourself for fun, you are only setting a bad example for managers that also have to warn users. You are all role models for the managers, and when they see you abusing moderation commands, that will encourage them to do the same. We don’t want a lot of cases of people giving false warnings to themselves or others.  

One more thing to keep in mind, if ANY HR is tagging you and asking you to stop doing something, please respect them and listen to them. We don’t ask you to stop doing something unless it’s needed.  If you really have an issue with it, you can contact them regarding it. 

Going forward, you are NOT to randomly warn yourself or others and only use the warning system for what it’s for.

i dont really know what izzy did other than what she wrote in the appeal, so could u say how bad it was on a scale from 1-10 @courtney


[28-Aug-20 12:22 PM] Polk#1596
2 months seem pretty early if she told people to die, but idk the situation that good


[28-Aug-20 12:23 PM] courtney#5125
HMM i dont remember exactly what she did. she was banned for hate and toxicity in the server, as far as i know. min sent proof somewhere in this channel. i can try to find it if u want


[28-Aug-20 12:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
regardless of the vote results keep her on hold for now


[28-Aug-20 12:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm certain she was involved in a trolling incident not so long ago


[28-Aug-20 12:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'll check once I'm back later today


[28-Aug-20 12:24 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Aug-20 06:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i havent played it in a while though its really grind-y


[29-Aug-20 06:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
just to beat a boss


[29-Aug-20 06:46 PM] Polk#1596
if u beat king crimson u get a requiem arrow


[29-Aug-20 06:46 PM] Polk#1596
true, but thats what makes it fun once u have grinded


[29-Aug-20 06:46 PM] Polk#1596
everyone doesnt start on the same level


[29-Aug-20 06:46 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Aug-20 06:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Polk have u played a bizarre day

[29-Aug-20 06:58 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Aug-20 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
but


[29-Aug-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
i didnt like it very much since its easy to get stands and everybody is equal


[29-Aug-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
but it was cool


[29-Aug-20 10:52 PM] courtney#5125
do y'all suppose we could a new announcement to mrs about inclusiveness in staff lounge


[29-Aug-20 10:53 PM] courtney#5125
pretty sure its been quite a while since we had that announcement and a lot of new mrs and even old mrs are being really excluding, ive had a couple ask if we could do an announcement to reinforce the idea


[29-Aug-20 10:57 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact depending on how long it is i might not be able to stay the entire time because i have to leave at around 3 for yearbook pictures


[29-Aug-20 10:58 PM] courtney#5125
bc tbh general discussion is by far more inclusive than staff lounge. im constantly seeing ppl respond and say hi and interact with new ppl in the chat


[29-Aug-20 10:58 PM] impact#0297
@ethan; it should be quick


[29-Aug-20 10:58 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[29-Aug-20 10:59 PM] Fraux#7971

[30-Aug-20 03:54 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah i def agree with that candy, last time one was made was start of this year and we've had a lot of new mrs since then.


[30-Aug-20 03:56 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well once it gets the votes for it candy, if you wanna type up an announcement for it you can. @courtney


[30-Aug-20 09:17 AM] katie#0200
@xM_inn wow that’s so disappointing


[30-Aug-20 09:18 AM] xM_inn#2821

:3bluecheck: | **INCLUSIVENESS IN STAFF LOUNGE**

Hello, @MR Team!

Recently, it has been brought to our attention that #staff-lounge is feeling like a very exclusive space right now. The first time there was an announcement on this particular topic was January 3rd, 2020, and we have not had one since. I've received a few anonymous concerns from people who have been feeling left out, ignored, and not welcome there.

Staff lounge was made for you all to discuss and enjoy conversations with your fellow MRs, but it seems to be that people haven't been feeling that same welcoming atmosphere that they have in the past. 

> • In staff lounge, when someone indicates they would like to start or join in the conversation, you should include them in it, turn your topic into something that everyone can debate and discuss.
> • When someone says "Hi!" in staff lounge, you should reflect the same positive energy and greet them back, as that's just the kind thing to do.
> • You should be trying to acknowledge what people are saying. For example, if someone makes a joke and you see it gets ignored, be the kind person that pings the joke sender and acknowledge what they said. 

Now, this announcement is **definitely not** one to try and make you be best friends with everyone. I understand that many of you have your own friend groups, and that is perfectly fine. However, that doesn't make you unable to say hello to someone, include someone in your conversation, and it, of course, doesn't make it okay for you to ignore someone who's wanting to join in on the discussion.

Overall, please remember to be kind to one another, you're a team. Open up your conversation so that someone new can be included, say hello to whoever wants to join, respond to what someone said, even make some new friends in staff lounge, etc! :aaheart6: 

*All the best,*

@KjRBLX what does rain have to do with hosting


[30-Aug-20 03:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Internet quality degrads in bad weather


[30-Aug-20 03:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also my mom feels my free time revolves around her is there anyone who can possibly take my a few of my sessions

[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] courtney#5125
daily pings are just


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] courtney#5125
kinda dumb in the first place


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] courtney#5125
if u wanna ping a few ppl to say a joke or start a convo, sure


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] ethan;#0003
make it a rule where you can only tag a max of X amount of people


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] ethan;#0003
and going over that X amount = warning


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] courtney#5125
but its kinda dumb to ping 20 people just for a "daily ping"


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] ethan;#0003
like we have to remind them this aint snapchat there are no streaks


[30-Aug-20 04:38 PM] courtney#5125
yeah


[30-Aug-20 04:39 PM] ethan;#0003
@courtney @bonnie591 Daily!


[30-Aug-20 04:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
makee a rule that means u need permission from the person to do the daily so people who get spam pinged can be asked to be removed


[30-Aug-20 04:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
> @courtney @bonnie591 Daily!
@ethan; LOL XDD I QUOTED


[30-Aug-20 04:39 PM] courtney#5125
i just think that daily pings are dumb, and having a rule that "protects" daily pings (in a sense) is silly too


[30-Aug-20 04:39 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 im loading into v2 rn and i hear shitting sounds 🤮


[30-Aug-20 04:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
eek


[30-Aug-20 04:40 PM] impact#0297
No rules on daily pings. That's just un-necessary regulations that provide no value.


[30-Aug-20 04:40 PM] impact#0297
Most people who do the daily pings are very respectful when asked to stop.


[30-Aug-20 04:40 PM] courtney#5125
either dont do a daily ping or just get over it when ppl quote it


[30-Aug-20 04:40 PM] Fraux#7971
@bonnie591 arent daily pings by theirselves span pinging


[30-Aug-20 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
so what should we do about people who quote it


[30-Aug-20 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
well u can argue that but once everyone quotes it


[30-Aug-20 04:41 PM] impact#0297
treat it as spamming


[30-Aug-20 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
then thats 5 pings


[30-Aug-20 04:41 PM] impact#0297
warning


[30-Aug-20 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok we'll need to make an announcement about it since we need to let people know that quoting a daily is now classed as spamming


[30-Aug-20 04:42 PM] impact#0297
no you won't


[30-Aug-20 04:42 PM] impact#0297
an announcement to everyone???


[30-Aug-20 04:42 PM] courtney#5125
once ppl figure out theyll get warned for it theyll stop


[30-Aug-20 04:42 PM] courtney#5125
a daily ping announcement isnt completely necessary, is it?


[30-Aug-20 04:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
so we're just gonna let them figure out that something they were allowed to do today they will get warned for tomorrow without any notice


[30-Aug-20 04:43 PM] courtney#5125
well its spamming


[30-Aug-20 04:43 PM] courtney#5125
spamming is a rule


[30-Aug-20 04:43 PM] impact#0297
they literally don't need a notice.. most people know that quoting a bunch of daily pings is disrespectful in itself


[30-Aug-20 04:43 PM] courtney#5125
i just think a whole announcement to everybody just saying that u cant quote daily pings is pointless


[30-Aug-20 04:44 PM] impact#0297
we don't have to give notice to people who clearly have no regard for others online


[30-Aug-20 04:44 PM] impact#0297
you create more problems than fix problems when you create an announcement on a small thing such as daily pings


[30-Aug-20 04:44 PM] impact#0297
the 'notice' tomorrow is a warning


[30-Aug-20 04:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
how about we give people a reminder about it if its first offense, then warning at second offense


[30-Aug-20 04:45 PM] impact#0297
sure your more than welcome to do that


[30-Aug-20 04:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
alright


[30-Aug-20 04:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
can i announce to the managements only that its now a reminder or warning


[30-Aug-20 04:45 PM] impact#0297
sure


[30-Aug-20 04:45 PM] impact#0297
i wish we had the meeting today but I couldn't make that time anymore


[30-Aug-20 04:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
eh it's alright theres always next week

[30-Aug-20 08:45 PM] ethan;#0003
they got too much backlash and hate


[30-Aug-20 08:45 PM] courtney#5125
what would that update include


[30-Aug-20 08:45 PM] ethan;#0003
so they canceled it


[30-Aug-20 08:45 PM] Fraux#7971
uhh i don’t think so

idk i just dont see a positive thing abt it. if we try to "require" masks, thats gonna get a lot hate for the people who cant afford robux to get that


[30-Aug-20 08:48 PM] impact#0297
I had a couple employees entertain the idea of having optional masks with Bloxton textures/outfitting to match the uniform


[30-Aug-20 08:49 PM] impact#0297
They would be picked up in the staff room.

Lee has been telling me he can never get into sessions because over an hour before there is already the MR limit


[31-Aug-20 02:54 PM] ethan;#0003
I wonder if that is the case for other mrs


[31-Aug-20 02:58 PM] courtney#5125
yeah it’s been that way for a long time. most mrs go at least an hour early, sometimes even an hour and a half or two, just to ensure they can get a spot before all of the servers reach max mrs

btw i reminded doge that if he's going to be inactive that he needs to have a notice up so i guess we'll see if he listens.

seems like a good group. but when I think of theatre groups, empire theater always comes to my mind 💀


[31-Aug-20 04:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Empire is quite unique


[31-Aug-20 04:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
They overtook emerald theatre as well i think


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Oo their interview and training thing is automatic


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
For training a bot tells you everything


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Then you do a quiz


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Similiar to our training but it's automatic


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Empire theatre, I got like framed.


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don’t really like empire actually. They’re very unorganized and their hrs don’t use grammar


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Now or in the past


[31-Aug-20 04:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
now


[31-Aug-20 04:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And there was no actual proof. It was just one place at the wrong time.


[31-Aug-20 04:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and people accused me because when I flew onto the stage, the set got deleted.


[31-Aug-20 04:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
.. I PASSED MY INTERVIEW AND IT NEVER RANKED ME

[31-Aug-20 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ranked me the second time


[31-Aug-20 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821

[31-Aug-20 05:08 PM] courtney#5125
personally, i dont think theres ever a reason to sit urself at all at training, but doing it that many times is just rlly unnecessary


[31-Aug-20 05:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
o_o


[31-Aug-20 05:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
we have chairs for a reason


[31-Aug-20 05:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
a few times is okay but thats like very extreme


[31-Aug-20 05:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
ask him why he did it that much and go from there


[31-Aug-20 05:29 PM] courtney#5125
alright


[31-Aug-20 05:36 PM] courtney#5125
@xM_inn he said he was using it to sit on top of the door, and every time someone needed something from him, he had to get down. then he would do it again when he got back up there ://

hm idk i mean as long as he wasnt disturbing the training session


[31-Aug-20 06:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
just verbally inform him not to excessively use the command


[31-Aug-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
i just talked to him


[31-Aug-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
(connor)


[31-Aug-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
because i knew there was more to the story


[31-Aug-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
he was trying to sit on top of the doors and kept falling off and that's why he used the command so many times


[31-Aug-20 07:47 PM] courtney#5125
yeah but it’s still unnecessary to do that, not to mention, it had to be really distracting for the trainees


[31-Aug-20 07:48 PM] impact#0297
the premise of my argument is that nobody actually stopped and asked why the fuck he used that command so many times


[31-Aug-20 07:49 PM] impact#0297
you'd be surprised how many things can be solved over a conversation


[31-Aug-20 07:51 PM] courtney#5125
idk I just don’t see the point in needing to sit *on top of a door*


[31-Aug-20 07:52 PM] courtney#5125
especially to the point where u end up needing to use that command 10-15+ times


[31-Aug-20 08:05 PM] impact#0297
that's very true


[31-Aug-20 08:05 PM] impact#0297
but if anything, that's just a reminder to be more professional


[31-Aug-20 08:05 PM] impact#0297
i'd hire him because he's persistent with a stupid command.. imagine how persistent he would be over something of value


[31-Aug-20 08:17 PM] courtney#5125
ig that’s one way to look at it. it’s distracting, unprofessional, and unnecessary to do it so many times in front of all of the trainees and helpers tho


[31-Aug-20 10:32 PM] ethan;#0003
i figured out how to make the cbs mad


[31-Aug-20 10:32 PM] ethan;#0003
when they are trying to get mod


[31-Aug-20 10:32 PM] ethan;#0003
you mod everyone except the person that they are impersonating


[31-Aug-20 10:32 PM] ethan;#0003
and then they embarrass themselves


[31-Aug-20 10:32 PM] ethan;#0003
when they say the kick message and it does nothing
