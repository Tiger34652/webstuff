[01-Apr-20 12:48 AM] bman#0435

[01-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; or @PackItUpMack can u try tagging MR team in staff announcements


[01-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
it wont let me


[01-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
for whatever reason


[01-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
I need them to see to turn off privacy settings for each discord server directly


[01-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
and not just normal settings


[01-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
cause people can still message u if u dont turn off direct messaging for1 specific discord server


[01-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
thats how that guy messaged maya


[01-Apr-20 01:38 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
tagged


[01-Apr-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
ty sir


[01-Apr-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
idk why it doesnt let me tag anyone


[01-Apr-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey pretty sure it turned off all of mine automatically?


[01-Apr-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
so maybe she accidentally changed her setting for one server


[01-Apr-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
its happened to like 3 people


[01-Apr-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
so far


[01-Apr-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
idk just check to make sure


[01-Apr-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
the MRs know now if people somehow still message them thats how


[01-Apr-20 01:43 AM] stacey#1000
1 thing I find odd about this is this whole thing seems to evolve around HS_7, tsunami sushi brings up a old tea doc thing about him that was sent to them, then his acc gets hacked and all the groups hes been in so far has been targetted


[01-Apr-20 01:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[01-Apr-20 01:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i think its a personal feud


[01-Apr-20 01:58 AM] stacey#1000
I turned off my roblox messages too


[01-Apr-20 01:58 AM] stacey#1000
For now at least


[01-Apr-20 02:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah this is all about HS_7. He owned Oasis resort too


[01-Apr-20 02:03 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why they going after us lol


[01-Apr-20 02:12 AM] stacey#1000
Because he use to be an MR here


[01-Apr-20 02:12 AM] stacey#1000
They going after every group or whatever he use to be a part of it seems. Idk just a theory


[01-Apr-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
no its bc our whole discord freaked out about it so now we're a target bc we "trash talked" them or some shit


[01-Apr-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
lol


[01-Apr-20 02:13 AM] emma;#1525
but i mean it being bc of HS is possible


[01-Apr-20 02:13 AM] emma;#1525
that's a fun theory


[01-Apr-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000
It started with his account being hacked so


[01-Apr-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000
Then he use to be a builder or something for venti I think


[01-Apr-20 02:14 AM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez are you yourself


[01-Apr-20 02:14 AM] emma;#1525
dark dmed me saying "Is that really Bloo on Roblox, I've never seen his avatar like that before" LOL


[01-Apr-20 02:14 AM] emma;#1525

[01-Apr-20 02:15 AM] emma;#1525

Sometimes people can see the channel without actually being able to see inside it

It‚Äôs like a discord issue


[01-Apr-20 03:40 AM] a. ·É¶#4222

"One of our main priorities during this situation is preventing unnecessary public worry and concern, therefore I'd like to request that you keep discussion regarding the incident in #general-discussion to a minimum. The stuff you're told here should stay here as it's technically MR classified stuff only. If you want to help someone out with securing their account, that's fine, but don't just walk in general discussion and begin a conversation about the incident. I'm not looking at anyone in particular, just a general reminder. I'd also like to remind you that you should try not to worry, the matter is being handled in the best way possible by the Bloxton High-Rank Team. Thank you everyone for your support. "

@High Rank (not april fools) Saabs Twitter may be hacked and is distributing suspicious links to her followers/people she is following, most of which are MRs and LRs. Not sure what we could possibly do about this other than ask Saab about it.

Hey everyone! Thanks for watching and spreading awareness about this method. The method they use is called the "HAR file method" so please be careful about who you're sending things to, and never send any sensitive data such as cookies, or HAR files even to your closest friend...

we should rename imag to mess with her


[01-Apr-20 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank the most verm can pretty much do is raid so we shouldnt worry as long as no one sends a HAR file or whatever and every mr+ has 2 step


[01-Apr-20 10:52 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yeet


[01-Apr-20 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
Basically we just got a new CB


[01-Apr-20 10:52 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Verm is a pussy


[01-Apr-20 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs all


[01-Apr-20 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
Verm gets banned for being a cb anytime I see him at the hotel so


[01-Apr-20 10:53 AM] stacey#1000
Or anyone with the name Verm


[01-Apr-20 10:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank in other words, you can now host sessions, open ur DMs, and do everything else as normal, but just remain cautious!

theyre in 3 dif servers


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
dral12345


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's cinder's only thing to improve his sad little life


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
is their user


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
the thing is


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
if it's cinder


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
even if he's pbanned he can still shutdown


[01-Apr-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
bc his exploit works as long as he connects to the server for even a second


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] bman#0435
how do u know its dral12345


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
and when you're pbanned you still connect


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] bman#0435
they got robux


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] bman#0435
lol


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
that's what one of the MRs sent me


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
and I searched his name


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
and it's that kid


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
doesn't mean they'll still exploit


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
the account is from 2014


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
so i dont know if it's cinder


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
but if it is then you're screwed sorry


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cinder has like 20+ accounts


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
i think I lost all credibility with cinder once cam was hired


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
so im not even gonna try to reason with him


[01-Apr-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435
did u ban


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and to think he wants me to apologize ü§£


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435
dral wasnt even in the server this time


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
@bman yeah notice how i pbanned, dral joined for a second while his pban processed kicking him, and he still shut down


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
yes he was


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
he joined right after i pbanned him and it still shutdown


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
but it was right after he joined so it's most likely him


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
let me exile


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
then he can't join


[01-Apr-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
bc he wont have the group rank

[01-Apr-20 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
and without telling me


[01-Apr-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
was it madis


[01-Apr-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
if shes hosting


[01-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
also mrs do that to me a bunch but idc because then the other mrs will start to dislike them for giving them more imterviewees


[01-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
.


[01-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
.


[01-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
.


[01-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
jk idc because they all flood to the main server


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
i had 4 mrs when i went to mod


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
i come back to 3


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
and the server she went to had like 8


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] bman#0435
ask her to come back then


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
but then i took 2 from that server


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
not noticing that she was on it


[01-Apr-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
and then cory joined


[01-Apr-20 09:15 PM] ethan;#0003
she only went to that server because her friend was on it


[01-Apr-20 09:15 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@katie ive been saying that for so long


[01-Apr-20 09:15 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but no one ever agrees with me üò≠


[01-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Cam#5887
thats getting old, mrs joining other mrs cayse theyre friends


[01-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Cam#5887
happens all the time


[01-Apr-20 09:16 PM] ethan;#0003
im pretty sure there was a rule


[01-Apr-20 09:16 PM] ethan;#0003
where if they do that they need to tell the host


[01-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[01-Apr-20 09:17 PM] Cam#5887
but like, there is always time to spend with friends


[01-Apr-20 09:17 PM] Cam#5887
at the hotel


[01-Apr-20 09:17 PM] Cam#5887
on discord


[01-Apr-20 09:17 PM] Cam#5887
etc


[01-Apr-20 09:17 PM] Cam#5887
interviews are only about 30 minutes long


[01-Apr-20 09:17 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[01-Apr-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003
and if each MR didnt do their own rules it would be done in 20 minutes


[01-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Cam#5887
that was a rule too


[01-Apr-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003
ik


[01-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Cam#5887
we go through that stuff as a host


[01-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Cam#5887
yet they still choose to do it, which is nice, yeah


[01-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Cam#5887
but like


[01-Apr-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
but like they are like "oh its not rules I need to tell them that they will be ranked in 24 hours and I need to tell them to use grammar and I need to tell them not to speak when Im speaking and I need to use exces emounts of emojis and words to make it like take 10 minutes long"


[01-Apr-20 09:19 PM] Cam#5887
i started putting the next training time in my guide


[01-Apr-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont even know when it started


[01-Apr-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
like i remember interviews would go so fast


[01-Apr-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
done in 20 minutes


[01-Apr-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
now they take 35-40 mins


[01-Apr-20 09:20 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[01-Apr-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
because they cant read the questions as they are coming, they have to go back after the questions are over to see the grammar mistakes


[01-Apr-20 09:20 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[01-Apr-20 09:21 PM] Cam#5887
another thing that ive noticed is a lot of incorrect usernames


[01-Apr-20 09:21 PM] Cam#5887
management board


[01-Apr-20 09:21 PM] Cam#5887
only takes a sec to search their names


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] bman#0435
and senior


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] bman#0435
for passers


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cam#5887
that too


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] bman#0435
happening way more frequently


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cam#5887
mhm


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because lobby interviews existed


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] bman#0435
i guess well address it during the hr meeting


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cam#5887
oh yeah i remember lobby ints


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cam#5887
thats what i did for my first interview


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
those moved so fast


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it just makes no sense to do them nowadays tho


[01-Apr-20 09:22 PM] bman#0435
i miss lobby ints


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] bman#0435
so much easier


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like both methods but


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lobby interviews are pretty freaking great


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Cam#5887
1 MR interviewing 8 people


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
plus no cbs either üòé


[01-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
that may be another reason that ints take so long


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
CBs


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
investigation on accounts


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and they expect us to treat them like normal people


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah no lol


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
after all the crap


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
they put us through


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cam#5887
big no


[01-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
about MRs kicking


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cam#5887
adida


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cam#5887
joined me


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
yall said it wasnt a big deal üôÑ


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i had to put it in quotations just because


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cam#5887
and a security cuffed her, and i asked her, you really like my servers huh?


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cam#5887
she bypassed at me


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I never did. I‚Äôve noticed it lately that there has been like someone kicking all


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cam#5887
and i said, well another pban for you


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i barely spoke at all about this lol


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
personally i want there to be a rule


[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Apr-20 09:25 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

after this announcement


[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
u get a verbal warning


[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think the best thing to do is not acknowledge them at all


[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if u do it again


[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] Cam#5887
tbh


[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Apr-20 09:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[01-Apr-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that'll just have them think they "won"


[01-Apr-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and plus


[01-Apr-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think there's anything to apologize for


[01-Apr-20 09:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they literally blame their problems on me even it was a team handling them


[01-Apr-20 09:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and cinder wonders why i block him all the damn time lmao


[01-Apr-20 09:29 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Apr-20 09:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
think about it


[01-Apr-20 09:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they both really dislike HS


[01-Apr-20 09:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
both rejoin servers to harass bloxton


[01-Apr-20 09:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
both are known to be exploiter-prone


[01-Apr-20 09:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and both have really dangerous behavior


[01-Apr-20 09:31 PM] Cam#5887

[01-Apr-20 09:50 PM] ethan;#0003
i thought all roblox games ran on one universal timezone


[01-Apr-20 09:51 PM] ethan;#0003
these mrs  take it into their own hands to investigate people if they are cbs


[01-Apr-20 09:51 PM] ethan;#0003
takes them 20 minuts


[01-Apr-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
@babymariobebe I see what you mean now when people say that the interviewing process is too strict


[01-Apr-20 09:52 PM] Cam#5887
LOL


[01-Apr-20 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[01-Apr-20 09:54 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[01-Apr-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
not when you got someone doing an fbi interview


[01-Apr-20 09:54 PM] Cam#5887
usually


[01-Apr-20 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
and you also got the mrs who dont pay attention for grammar strikes during the interviews and rely on chatlogs at the end to tell them if they got grammar strikes


[01-Apr-20 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
that is why interviews are now such a long and painful process


[01-Apr-20 09:56 PM] ethan;#0003
and not to forget the mrs who do their own set of rules


[01-Apr-20 09:56 PM] ethan;#0003
and lastly, the mrs who do all three


[01-Apr-20 09:56 PM] ethan;#0003
those are the ones that get on my nerves


[01-Apr-20 09:56 PM] ethan;#0003

I‚Äôm pretty sure


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Awhile ago it didn‚Äôt take this long


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
It like took half the time


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
last time it took only 25 mins


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
trainings 45 mins


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435
and others take like 50 mins


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435
which i dont like


[01-Apr-20 10:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
gotta be in the middle


[01-Apr-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I mean I guess it‚Äôs not entirely their fault


[01-Apr-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like what if they get someone who types one letter at a time


[01-Apr-20 10:14 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
sometimes its fast cause they put time limits


[01-Apr-20 10:14 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and fail them for time


[01-Apr-20 10:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like stick fingers ya know


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like some ppl stab one key to type


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
*cough* my mom *cough*


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
that can be bad but golly


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
they should do apps then


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if someone knows they type that slow they should go to apps


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye apps has no time limit


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
you can stab slowly


[01-Apr-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Apps might even be easier they have more time to think


[01-Apr-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I feel like


[01-Apr-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Interviews over time have been taking longer


[01-Apr-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and longer


[01-Apr-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and longer


[01-Apr-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and longer


[01-Apr-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they keep getting slower idk how that even happens


[01-Apr-20 10:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and then u got the rly old MRs like saab


[01-Apr-20 10:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

‚ÄúBefore we had discord how do you think people did it?‚Äù


[01-Apr-20 10:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And see what he does with that


[01-Apr-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435
tell him to save them up and report when he gets his rank back


[01-Apr-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435

[01-Apr-20 10:38 PM] Cam#5887
all he wants is a talkative role


[01-Apr-20 10:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

me too ramm


[01-Apr-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
If he continues complaining just fire him


[01-Apr-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
After his suspension is up


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cam#5887
Hes been complaining


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cam#5887
should i put on the card to fire after suspension is over?


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] stacey#1000
So fire him when his suspension


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cam#5887
Ok


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cam#5887
will be doing that right now


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs unacceptable for him to go complaining to HRs about it and acting immature


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cam#5887
Mhm


[01-Apr-20 11:09 PM] stacey#1000
So he just earned himself a fire.


[01-Apr-20 11:10 PM] stacey#1000
And if he does it again if he gets his job back. He will be blacklisted possibly.


[01-Apr-20 11:10 PM] Cam#5887
alrighty


[01-Apr-20 11:11 PM] Cam#5887
should i tell him


[01-Apr-20 11:11 PM] Cam#5887
he will be fired after his suspension is over?


[01-Apr-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
@Cam Tbh just fire  him immediately then lol


[01-Apr-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
Idk why this HR team loves doing suspensions to fire so much


[01-Apr-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
if we're gonna fire them shouldn't it just happen immediately


[01-Apr-20 11:16 PM] Cam#5887
yea true


[01-Apr-20 11:16 PM] emma;#1525
Also should we have the MRs update themselves and fix staff lounge lol since april fools is basically over


[01-Apr-20 11:16 PM] Cam#5887
id say so


[01-Apr-20 11:17 PM] Cam#5887
but its not up to me ofc


[01-Apr-20 11:17 PM] emma;#1525
I'll just tag them all saying they need to update their names in the next 12 hours


[01-Apr-20 11:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'll change everything back.


[01-Apr-20 11:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Apr-20 11:21 PM] emma;#1525

he sent me that too


[01-Apr-20 11:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
can we actually blacklist him fr


[01-Apr-20 11:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
him hinting he's about to troll just worsened the situation

[02-Apr-20 02:50 AM] stacey#1000
Idk


[02-Apr-20 02:52 AM] Polk#1596
Yes or no plz @stacey


[02-Apr-20 02:52 AM] Polk#1596
We don't have to say yes to every event


[02-Apr-20 02:53 AM] Polk#1596
Personally, this event seems like a bit much but if you guys wanna do it I don't mind


[02-Apr-20 02:53 AM] stacey#1000
I am in between rn


[02-Apr-20 02:53 AM] stacey#1000
Like it seems like too much work


[02-Apr-20 02:53 AM] stacey#1000
But at same time doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad idea


[02-Apr-20 02:54 AM] Polk#1596
Yes, I agree


[02-Apr-20 02:54 AM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt see why it has to be like a week long thing either


[02-Apr-20 02:54 AM] stacey#1000
It could be a one day thing


[02-Apr-20 02:54 AM] Polk#1596
I'll just wait until everyone wakes up to DM her back


[02-Apr-20 02:54 AM] Polk#1596
Wait


[02-Apr-20 02:55 AM] Polk#1596
Oh its because


[02-Apr-20 02:55 AM] Polk#1596
Every group gets their own day or something


[02-Apr-20 02:55 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think it takes too much work tbh


[02-Apr-20 02:55 AM] stacey#1000
That would take getting agreements from other groups


[02-Apr-20 02:55 AM] stacey#1000
Groups we might not be allied with or have a good standing with


[02-Apr-20 02:56 AM] Polk#1596
Yes, she is going around asking all of their alliances I guess


[02-Apr-20 02:56 AM] stacey#1000
Too much work


[02-Apr-20 02:56 AM] stacey#1000
If it was a one day thing


[02-Apr-20 02:56 AM] stacey#1000
For one group


[02-Apr-20 02:56 AM] stacey#1000
Then I would agree


[02-Apr-20 02:57 AM] Polk#1596
Ok, she said it was the first draft though


[02-Apr-20 02:57 AM] stacey#1000
But like week long thing seems too confusing and a lot of work. Especially having to communicate with all the different groups at once. Easy miscommunication


[02-Apr-20 02:57 AM] Polk#1596
So if anyone has a better idea we can suggest stuff


[02-Apr-20 02:57 AM] stacey#1000
I suggest a one day thing


[02-Apr-20 02:57 AM] Polk#1596
Yes I know, that was my immediate reaction


[02-Apr-20 02:58 AM] Polk#1596
Okay, can u dm me it


[02-Apr-20 02:58 AM] Polk#1596
Then if everyone votes no we can suggest that to them and consider another vote if they accept


[02-Apr-20 02:59 AM] stacey#1000
Like if she is talking about having a huge event for us and all our allies it could be a one day thing where all alliances visited each group and then each group hosts an event at their group or something.


[02-Apr-20 02:59 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs all I got


[02-Apr-20 02:59 AM] stacey#1000
For now


[02-Apr-20 02:59 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs 4am and my brain is half asleep so if I think of something better I‚Äôll let you know


[02-Apr-20 03:29 AM] Polk#1596
Okay!


[02-Apr-20 04:21 AM] bonnie591#0591
what @Polk


[02-Apr-20 04:27 AM] Polk#1596
koala cafe HR dmed me it and they want an event with us @bonnie591


[02-Apr-20 05:06 AM] xM_inn#2821
@Polk Bruh I already told them no..


[02-Apr-20 05:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
They want Baby or Bear to develop for our game in order for the event to work but Baby and Bear are busy atm


[02-Apr-20 05:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
Idk why they asked again


[02-Apr-20 05:46 AM] Polk#1596
Oh.. Might just be a little communication mistake between the koala HRs, I'll tell her we already declined it


[02-Apr-20 05:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alright


[02-Apr-20 05:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
Tell her why too


[02-Apr-20 07:25 AM] bman#0435

[02-Apr-20 11:59 AM] Cam#5887
can we release a shout an hour early? or should we wait like 30 minutes before?


[02-Apr-20 11:59 AM] Cam#5887
cause my ints were cancelled


[02-Apr-20 11:59 AM] Cam#5887
and i dont want people to have their hopes up about interviews


[02-Apr-20 11:59 AM] Cam#5887
and they were actually cancelled


[02-Apr-20 12:00 PM] Cam#5887
im just gonna post it cause that seems the best option


[02-Apr-20 12:01 PM] bman#0435
i do an hour early because when i start my ints i announce trainings which is an hour after


[02-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Cam#5887

Ask her to go on her main account and have her DM me her security code on it.


[02-Apr-20 05:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Like the security code MRs made in case they were hacked.


[02-Apr-20 05:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Just to prove it's her.


[02-Apr-20 05:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[02-Apr-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
i understand this doc may be USEFUL but its not even necessary


[02-Apr-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, I did not receive a word based on this.


[02-Apr-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
and if vac asked then why were we not notified


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't like the fact the he did this a 3rd time.


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
@High Rank did anyone give permission to vac for making the not-so-needed doc about how to kick people?


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For me, no.


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] ethan;#0003
does it really matter?


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
he claimed he got approved but no one asked


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It kind of does.


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] Cam#5887
i didnt no


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here's why.


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
um ya, it does because we all agreed that they ask and get all of our official approval


[02-Apr-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) This info we already knew.


[02-Apr-20 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003
its called he is simping for a promo


[02-Apr-20 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Apr-20 05:28 PM] stacey#1000

[02-Apr-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, that's basically problem #2.


[02-Apr-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435

[02-Apr-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435

BUT


[02-Apr-20 05:32 PM] xM_inn#2821

@High Rank Would any of y'all be interested in doing another Q&A with the Bloxton community in our disc server? We've done them before and they're usually pretty successful and a good way to connect with our LRs and guests. We don't have to do like a "Press Conference" thing before it, but if you guys have any topics you think we need to talk about then we can make it work. So, yes or no to a Q&A and if yes state below if you want to have a press conference beforehand for any reason.

DECLINE OF FRIENDSHIP

Hello, xM_inn!

As sad as it may seem, but I am announcing that our friendship has officially come to a close as of 12:20 aM. I don't think that us both make a good pair nor do we get along with each other. As a result, your office has been officially removed as well from the office. I am discontinuing this friendship not because I hate you, but due to the fact that we do not get along and that is the main purpose. Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

DECLINE OF FRIENDSHIP

Hello, @Unknown!

As sad as it may seem, but I am announcing that our friendship has officially come to a close as of 12:22 AM. I don't think that us both make a good pair nor do we get along with each other. As a result, your office has been officially removed as well from the office. I am discontinuing this friendship not because I hate you, but due to the fact that we do not get along and that is the main purpose. Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

so basically i was transgender for a REALLY long time because i honestly felt like i was transgender for the longest time (female to male) but when i started taking my anti-depressants i thought more and more about it. sometimes id even cry over it bc i felt so confused, but i decided that i wasnt. :') things that felt right before didnt feel right anymore and when i actually figured myself out it was already too late and i felt like if i just came out and said it i would be judged a lot? since everyone already thought i was a guy and I THOUGHT I WAS A GUY I REALLY DID BUT so much thought was put into it and ISDFIJSDEKFEWE :Cryin:  AND I CANT BELIEVE IM FUCKING SAYING THIS RN KILL MEEEE

Hi Stacey


[03-Apr-20 10:10 PM] stacey#1000
I'm hearing from an LR that Laurenqz, a senior management account was hacked, i just want to see if anyone here has heard about it.


[03-Apr-20 10:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I haven‚Äôt


[03-Apr-20 10:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Me either.


[03-Apr-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
Questioning her right now, because if her account is compromised, I am suspending her.


[03-Apr-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
Beth is telling me, her account was hacked and she lost her super happy face.


[03-Apr-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
Won't take any further action until I hear from lauren.

[03-Apr-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Apr-20 10:24 PM] Cam#5887

[03-Apr-20 10:24 PM] bman#0435
@stacey ask her if she received the trade and declined it


[03-Apr-20 10:25 PM] bman#0435
like she manually declined


[03-Apr-20 10:25 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Apr-20 10:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sus


[03-Apr-20 10:32 PM] stacey#1000
Suspend her while I am questioning her?


[03-Apr-20 10:32 PM] stacey#1000
I will make a ping.


[03-Apr-20 10:33 PM] stacey#1000
Because we don't know for sure if it is someone else accessing her account, or if someone else still has access to her account.


[03-Apr-20 10:33 PM] bman#0435
@xM_inn @emma; tbh can all hrs get access to the codes, or at least a select amount of HRs or just GMs and BoDs because worst case scenario we have an issue where someone needs to verify its them we dont have access to their codes


[03-Apr-20 10:33 PM] stacey#1000
Oh she responded


[03-Apr-20 10:33 PM] stacey#1000
1 sec


[03-Apr-20 10:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what she say


[03-Apr-20 10:35 PM] stacey#1000
she claims someone accessed her account to steal her items


[03-Apr-20 10:35 PM] stacey#1000
So, here is the issue.


[03-Apr-20 10:35 PM] bman#0435
yall be aware of ur trades, flesh has smalls which could mean more possible targets


[03-Apr-20 10:35 PM] bman#0435
@stacey did she click on any files or suspicious links like we reminded them not to do...


[03-Apr-20 10:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I didn‚Äôt even know there was an exploit where if you still decline it goes through


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that‚Äôs scary


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
1. Her account was compromised at some point today and she didn't inform an HR.


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] bman#0435
its happened a few times recently but it may be patched @Bloo_Berriez


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] bman#0435
did she tell beth lol


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] bman#0435
or how did beth find out


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
she


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
went


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
offline


[03-Apr-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
again


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435
i swear the hacker is probs in her acc lol


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we should ask her security code thing to confirm it‚Äôs actually her speaking but we don‚Äôt have access


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435
bloo do u have access to the codes


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like bman said we need access to the codes


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
nope


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
That's what I was thinking


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435
not even bods have access...


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] bman#0435

[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
Do I have permission to suspend her


[03-Apr-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
for security reasons

[03-Apr-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Apr-20 10:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Apr-20 10:43 PM] bman#0435
ask her if she went to trade hangout or engaged with him


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] bman#0435
hackers dont randomly target people unless they see something they want


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
why don‚Äôt u just ask her for her security code even though we don‚Äôt know what it is and see how she responds @stacey


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] bman#0435
well bloo


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] bman#0435
she may have not filled it out


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] bman#0435
it was strongly recommended


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] stacey#1000
she went offline again


[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Apr-20 10:44 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Apr-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
plus if she tells me it


[03-Apr-20 10:45 PM] stacey#1000
i cant see it


[03-Apr-20 10:45 PM] bman#0435
also can i make an announcement to management+ about avoiding the use of :info for safechat


[03-Apr-20 10:45 PM] bman#0435
its been unreliable recently


[03-Apr-20 10:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
do managers use info to check? normally I name my trainees C7RN


[03-Apr-20 10:45 PM] bman#0435
some do


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
one manager did it at my session


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
since someone was afk


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
and infoed them


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
it said they had safechat


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
i named them


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
and it didnt tag


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
so


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah you can then


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
some seniors may have replaced it in their sessions too


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
ty


[03-Apr-20 10:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

laurenqzToday at 11:49 PM

[03-Apr-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
is this a good letter to send her?


[03-Apr-20 10:51 PM] bman#0435
id say so, but get bloos opinion too


[03-Apr-20 10:52 PM] bman#0435
Greetings @Management team and @Senior Management team!

I am here to inform you of recent and recurring issues regarding the reliability of the "info" command and it's relations to safechat. Over the course of the past few days, I have noticed that the information command has been giving out incorrect information about accounts, in claims that users that currently do **not** carry safechat are displayed as users that **do**. Basically, if a user does not have safechat, the info command box will show up (sometimes) as they do. Please stick to the basic methods of the chatting and naming, as those currently are the most reliable sources for this topic. Thank you for understanding and I'll keep you guys updated on if this ever gets fixed!

[04-Apr-20 12:08 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
(not the sexual case)


[04-Apr-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
uh


[04-Apr-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
the sexual case is what he did


[04-Apr-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
both of them


[04-Apr-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
actually


[04-Apr-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
maybe i should reopen those cases but ive been so busy


[04-Apr-20 12:09 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey Gonna give lauren her rank back since she knew her code and said she changed her password, cleared cookies, etc


[04-Apr-20 12:10 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
@xAfroTrey thats why i disagreed lol


[04-Apr-20 12:10 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
i get


[04-Apr-20 12:10 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
weird vibes.................


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
o


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think i remember his accuser being sus as hell tho


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
all i know he was in the sexual case


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
so


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
he had two


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
i kinda keep my distance from him more


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
and there's proof of him saying sketchy things


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
two?


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
i think so


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it was with crystal and tehana


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
why hasnt he gotten in trouble


[04-Apr-20 12:11 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; ok add her back to boards too and stuff


[04-Apr-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
because every time a case against him pops up, a bigger one pops up somewhere else


[04-Apr-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
good thing its cleared up now


[04-Apr-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525

[04-Apr-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435

@Polk we've literally all had this conversation with minn before


[04-Apr-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
no one wants to rank other people's passers, we have tons of bans that are a bigger priority for admin acts, and if you dont rank your passers because you assume someone else wants to they wont be ranked for days and people will complain!!!

[04-Apr-20 04:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you might as well fire him now


[04-Apr-20 04:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no reason to drag him into suspensions if he's not willing to listen


[04-Apr-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs close to a blacklist.

[04-Apr-20 04:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
we should keep apps open 24/7 tbh


[04-Apr-20 04:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Or do we get overwhelmed now that everyone is stuck indoors?


[04-Apr-20 04:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
nah


[04-Apr-20 04:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'd rather have it weekends like before


[04-Apr-20 04:56 PM] Cam#5887
i just, if we have apps open for a while like daily


[04-Apr-20 04:56 PM] Cam#5887
idk how many people would be at interviews


[04-Apr-20 04:57 PM] Cam#5887

[04-Apr-20 09:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

this is so wholesome i speak spanish and cleaned a room of a guest and had a conversation in spanish at bloxton


[05-Apr-20 04:17 AM] Beartikal#9760
@everyone recently ive visited some other hotels for curiousity and all I see is abuse, trollers, and corruption.
thanks to all of you for keeping Bloxton's message pure and clear. Every server I go in i see happy faces, happy staff, and a professional environment.
you guys are really good at what you do and I probably dont say this as much as I should!

@High Rank Cubs347 would like the Former MR role. Any disagreements? He was suspended in 2018 for leaking the MB and resigned while suspended and was last warned in summer of 2019. He also appealed his Discord ban in the middle of January this year.

@High Rank eliyafa14 also sent in a Former MR role appeal. Trey already took a poll but literally got 1 vote and it was mine. It was removed due to her behavior towards Emma and avatw. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pi0Bg-XZKxOgj5WgWw_4J2VKm48IEdCimOEwLWZWuCM/edit?usp=sharing
:checkmark: for yes (eliyafa14)

‚òëÔ∏è for yes (Le_Grx)

Former MR Appeal  Username: eliyafa14 Reason: Disrespect towards a HR and MR.   You should give me back my former MR role at Bloxton hotel‚Äôs server because I would like a fresh new start at Bloxton Hotels. I will be completely honest, I was a fool and I was very immature and I...

[05-Apr-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) notice how he doesn't apologize or show much regret, i don't think he feels that sorry tbh


[05-Apr-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
hes trying to say that hes payed so much money towards bloxton that we should return it with the role


[05-Apr-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435

[05-Apr-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
Le_Grx wasn‚Äôt being loyal when he trashed talked me üòÇ


[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
But ok


[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^^


[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] bman#0435

[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] bman#0435
i dont think he knows what bypassing means


[05-Apr-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he literally proceeded to make fun of emma and not take the situation seriously at all lol


[05-Apr-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

"I was just joking around"


[05-Apr-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why does that quote bother me so much


[05-Apr-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
Also y‚Äôall are really voting to let eliya get her former mr role back


[05-Apr-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
Fakes


[05-Apr-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
She doesn‚Äôt deserve it at all


[05-Apr-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But why tho lol


[05-Apr-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
She‚Äôs lucky to be in the server after the crap she pulled


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait what happened


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
Trey she literally harassed me publically and in DMs


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
That was a choice she made and she can live with the consequences


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know it was in general discussion


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
Former MR is not a necessity


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
She shouldn‚Äôt be able to appeal


[05-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When did she harass you in DMs


[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hm ok


[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
People harass me in DMs more than in gd lmao doesn‚Äôt mean I always tell y‚Äôall tho


[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Do you have the messages somewhere


[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt want to be that person


[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
No I think I blocked her and closed DMs but I can look


[05-Apr-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok


[05-Apr-20 04:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I do remember the unnecessary shit she did in general


[05-Apr-20 04:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That was not cool at all


[05-Apr-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
In my opinion we really shouldn‚Äôt be letting people appeal for former MR at all


[05-Apr-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs a privilege and not a necessity


[05-Apr-20 04:22 PM] emma;#1525
And if people make a choice to act poorly and get it removed then they can live with that


[05-Apr-20 04:22 PM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm tired of this game where we take and give the former role from people every few months bc they can‚Äôt decide how they want to act


[05-Apr-20 04:22 PM] ethan;#0003
@Cooqkie why did you put jvimmy up for a promotion opinion- he got hired on april 2nd and just got unpbaned

[05-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[05-Apr-20 04:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 04:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Both options are fine tho

[05-Apr-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435

[05-Apr-20 05:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that appeal seems like


[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the first sentence gets on my nerves


[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they dont speak english


[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
u get on my nerves


[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809

"I would never do that because I work at other Hotels and cafes"


[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] Cam#5887
even tho he did it


[05-Apr-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-Apr-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also uh


[05-Apr-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
many of the things he said there are really irrelevant to the appeal


[05-Apr-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the point of it is to explain your situation and have deep regret all the way through


[05-Apr-20 05:21 PM] bman#0435

[05-Apr-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-Apr-20 05:51 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank So obviously the Q&A didn't happen this past weekend (blame bman it's all his fault) so I think I'm going to plan for it to be at noon (12 PM CST) this Friday (the 10th). This way it's on a low-activity day as far as anyone who's doing online school, it's time zone friendly (you're welcome minn üôÑ) and it's not too far into Easter weekend that people will be busy. Let me know if this absolutely is a horrible idea! (Input from bman, ethan, and the other resident sarcastic b*tches will not be taken into consideration unless it's serious)


[06-Apr-20 05:51 PM] emma;#1525
oops


[06-Apr-20 05:51 PM] emma;#1525
that wasn't done

[06-Apr-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
there's no reason not to put passers up immediately


[06-Apr-20 06:40 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey @xM_inn i ranked your passers


[06-Apr-20 06:41 PM] bman#0435
she already has 2 warnings as a senior


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@High Rank Well, well, well. Looks like Tango was at it again during Daisy's session. Making a fool out of herself for the 3rd time by doing the basics of what not to do as a former MR. I just blacklisted her off the group and banned her from the Discord. I don't think she deserves an appeal, so I thought I might as well update you guys just for a heads up.


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
what did she do


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Cam#5887
what did she do


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Cam#5887
...


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

thats not surprising


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Cam#5887
at all


[06-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She did everything similar like before.


[06-Apr-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So yeah, she's out.


[06-Apr-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How do you guys feel about her appeal chances?


[06-Apr-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause I'm not even interested in her going through the process.


[06-Apr-20 06:52 PM] bman#0435
has anyone else noticed seniors not asking to host anymore


[06-Apr-20 06:52 PM] bman#0435
i literally pinged them asking for hosts for servers 2-5


[06-Apr-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
ive been having to ask them to host


[06-Apr-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
but not for my int today


[06-Apr-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
they've hosted so much bc of coronacation lol


[06-Apr-20 06:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's corona time


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
(kill me now)


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
keeping in mind that we're hosting literally more sessions than we ever have for this amount of time, y'all might just have to not host every single server every single time


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
bc seniors can't be expected to host 10 times a day


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kind of sucks we can't really host our own servers


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
notice how i say "y'all" bc i dont host lol #inactive


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey i've hosted multiple servers alone before


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
you technically just need BOD permission


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah but polk said we can't


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so uh


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525

[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
bon bon


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
welp might as well ask bonnie now


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
or bloo


[06-Apr-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
bloo would say yes


[06-Apr-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Aight so I'm just gonna have her appeal chances pretty much gone


[06-Apr-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If anyone feels different to that


[06-Apr-20 06:55 PM] emma;#1525
yes i strongly disagree


[06-Apr-20 06:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-Apr-20 06:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i dont think it matters if we host our own. just have an a rank 11 in the server, and u go host other one but thats gonna take forever lol


[06-Apr-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
awesome


[06-Apr-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

OMG HAHAHAH


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
well rank 11's cant technically host so you gotta bounce back and forth


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
did saab know the whole time


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
bloo, i dont like that idea @Bloo_Berriez


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
but i mean it's not like we don't spend 90% of the session fake AFK


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
plus managers are capable of DMing us if a situation comes up lol


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how come polk


[06-Apr-20 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
you host your own server, then the other servers can be hosted by a senior


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
sometimes seniors arent on


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
a server should always be under supervision by a senior management+ unless we have to go


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and theres a lot of servers


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
in my opinion

@Polk we were just talking about how the seniors seem to be a bit burnt out bc we're hosting so many sessions, and seniors aren't volunteering to host them all

and in the past some HRs have been allowed to host two servers at once


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
bouncing back between them


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
with 2+ good, older managers on the server


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
and it's never been an issue


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
hm


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i mean im fake afk during my session


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think it should be a routine thing


[06-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
still dont think it is a good idea though


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
if seniors is the problem we should hire more


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
but if there's 4 full servers and you can't get a 3rd senior i dont think an HR should be forced to just let the forth server go


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
with what managers üòÇ no one ever likes them


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
every vote it's "this one person is the only one we like bc everyone else sucks"


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
and that one person wins


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
jack left managers to take over all the time


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
bc no one else can even be considered


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
idk if yall complained about that


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
dont know, but btw you can always ask another HR to host a server


[06-Apr-20 07:00 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
or not


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
thats JACK @a. ·É¶


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lol we tried


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
well he did it SO MUCH


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
ok well jack isn't the best standard of good hosting ngl but if done carefully it's really not hard to host two servers at once lol


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i just agree with the fact that our seniors are tired having to host like 3-4 sessions a day.


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
does it require trainees left for two hours @emma;


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
yes ofc trey


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i host sometimes 1 and i get tired.


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
at LEAST


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lol


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
aw hell yeah


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
3 hours shows more committment


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
i may agree if the situation is that no seniors are available to host or HRs, if not then i still disagree


[06-Apr-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
why

[06-Apr-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
basically


[06-Apr-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
im yelling at MRs


[06-Apr-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
to not raid videos


[06-Apr-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
is that what my understanding is


[06-Apr-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
nono


[06-Apr-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we already did that


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
ugh


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
boring


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
3 of us


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
did that


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
we told them to stop


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
uh i dont see an announcement


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
lol thats all i did


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
in sl?


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
if its not announced did it really happen


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i didnt see anyone rly yellingat them


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
.


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
.


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
.


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u said dont announce storY


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
idk all i wanted to do was dm the guy üôÑ


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
why would we DM the guy


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
because it wasnt that big of a deal


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but now everyone is making a big deal


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
treys dming the guy


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
look if a guy made a video hating on one of our MRs, we're not going to run to him and apologize


[06-Apr-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
so trey dont even think about apologizing


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
trey already dmed him


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
however that doesn't mean the MRs should be going and harassing him on a livestream chat


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I already told him that I was neutral.


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
their actions weren't warranted but they were slightly justified


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
trey you shouldn't be taking a stance on this


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] bman#0435
y would u even contact him


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
look we need to side with our MRs without seeming biased bc if we look against them we look weak


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] bman#0435
hes clearly doing it for attention and for content


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
idk why you contacted him in the first place


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because the MRs commented on their video..?


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
i mean you're dming someone who clearly wants to expose others


[06-Apr-20 10:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like the video hasn't even premiered yet.


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
so i hope your DMs dont end up in his livestream


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
trey he made a video hating on kathy


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
we do NOT owe him an apology


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
and we do NOT owe him any favors


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
now I don't think it's appropriate for the MRs to do what they did which is why I think an announcement about that could be made


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
he didnt hate on kathy but kathy got hate from it, which is why i wanted to dm him with what his videos are doing to mrs


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
but they have freedom to comment whatever the fuck they want wherever the fuck they want to


[06-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
and as long as it's not breaking laws or trash talking bloxton or an ally we really can't do much about it in terms of punishment


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
so please stop dming that guy right now because that's going to make this much messier than it needs to be


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, I'm continuing.


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
for any particular reason?


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
would you apologize to Dash if she was harassed by a team of MRs? no


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but emma


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
can we see the dms?


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyve like


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not saying what the MRs did was right


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hang on lemme try to find the right word


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It really wasn't.


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
But we are NOT apologizing to someone who harassed one of our MRs


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they like


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
publically


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
on youtube


[06-Apr-20 10:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
fueled a possible raid


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Dude we get raided all the time


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
thats not their fault lol


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
we fuel it ourselves bc we're a large ass group


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
verm wanted to raid us bc we were complaining about potentially being raided


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
WE started that


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
we as in THE HRS


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uh, no.


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
and I don't see us apologizing to verm bc he got harassed


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We didn't start it at all.


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
verm was stealing accounts tho?


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk how we started a raid tho


[06-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Yes we did lmao they literally said they wanted to raid bc we were all freaking out about it and taking so many steps not to get raided


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
We didn't say "omg verm raid us"


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
We didn't want them to raid


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
Verm took our actions as a justifiable reason to raid


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
Just like this loser kid on the internet is going to take MRs standing up for their friend as a justifiable reason to raid


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
And if you agree with him then I'm done talking to you because I'm not going to get anywhere with you


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma, it literally started off in general discussion. This happened before we took the necessary precautions.


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
arent mrs technically allowed to comment on videos tho without us doing anything other than telling them that its really not the best decision ?


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
Don't ask for my help and then refuse to listen if you want to handle it yourself


[06-Apr-20 10:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
emmaaaaaaaaaaa


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i got something off topicccccccc


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
I was trained for this but clearly my advice isn't wanted right now so good luck lol


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
yes cookie

[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
STARTING TO ANNOY ME


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
emma literally i love ur advice shut up


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
crip is a derogatory term for a disabled person


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ik


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
I'd say ban and fire


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but have u seen


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the questions


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
bc that's no different then the N word


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
so


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hes asked


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg fire


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
YES


[06-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO


[06-Apr-20 10:10 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
trey can we see the dms


[06-Apr-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
ok i put up an announcement to MRs


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; did u say to ban the guy from questions or just fire


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc i forgot


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ik u said fire


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
i said if you want to fire and ban go ahead


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i fired already


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
pretty sure we can fire and ban for derogatory words


[06-Apr-20 10:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
well he has a thing


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
for doing that in the questions channel


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
i mean if he's fired he needs to lose his role


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
roles*


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
so he'd lose talkative anyways right


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i took them already


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
and would have to request it


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
i mean we can't only ban someone from questions


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
actually i guess we could LOL but i dont think we have a precedent set for that


[06-Apr-20 10:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk wut that means but ok


[06-Apr-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
well we don't usually ban people from just one channel


[06-Apr-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
*technically* we can set permissions where he couldn't, because you can set permissions for individual people instead of just a role


[06-Apr-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
but we haven't done that ever before so idk


[06-Apr-20 10:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[06-Apr-20 10:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
aight so the dm ended off really well


[06-Apr-20 10:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@emma; you know why you didn‚Äôt get 1000 reactions


[06-Apr-20 10:58 PM] emma;#1525
bc im a slut üôÉ


[06-Apr-20 10:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no


[06-Apr-20 10:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
you just tagged everyone. there is a setting the mute everyone tags but polky tagged verified, so that doesn‚Äôt get suppressed so everyone got it even with mute settings


[06-Apr-20 10:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

Dont follow the admins, follow the **QA TESTERS IN THE EGG HUNT GROUP** - they have **ALL LAUNCHERS** and since they are teenagers, they are more likely to give it out


[07-Apr-20 12:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
also heres this for you:


[07-Apr-20 12:55 PM] Beartikal#9760

[07-Apr-20 03:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[07-Apr-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
So she had 6 heads... didn‚Äôt ask them to leave... and is mad they didn‚Äôt leave...


[07-Apr-20 03:39 PM] bman#0435

[07-Apr-20 03:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
anything


[07-Apr-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
just tell her she‚Äôs responsible for controlling how many MRs are in the server so if she wants less she needs to handle that


[07-Apr-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
It‚Äôs not fair to keep two heads in game and then order managers not to name them


[07-Apr-20 03:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ikr


[07-Apr-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525

[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
shes annoyed


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
when this is pretty much her fault


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it really is


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435

[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435

[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
i trust her


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
"great another mistake"


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
because


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
really disliking her poor decision making tbh


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
her mistake


[07-Apr-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
its TATI


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] bman#0435
jk this isnt even a big deal


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yes and no


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but she does this alot


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] bman#0435
aevster isnt even a head so...


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
also the part aboutthe one head


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
looks like its in her guide


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and that def shouldnt be there


[07-Apr-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like the attitude she gave to the admins


[07-Apr-20 03:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[07-Apr-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that felt really rude and irresponsible


[07-Apr-20 03:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
she got angry and she let them be there


[07-Apr-20 03:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; wacha think


[07-Apr-20 03:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
verbal or written or nothing


[07-Apr-20 03:56 PM] emma;#1525
Imag is a senior manager, if a manager isn't listening to her PMs she has the capability to give them a verbal warning üôÑ


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
Clearly imag wants you to solve all of her problems for her which is ridiculous


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think written honestly


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
And she didn't handle the "i have too many heads" situation well at all


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
well she didn't handle it


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
she just complained and did nothing lol


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she just stood there and expected us to fix the situation


[07-Apr-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[07-Apr-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im sorry but like


[07-Apr-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
for what reason


[07-Apr-20 03:58 PM] emma;#1525
I would say tell her that as a senior she needs to take charge of her training session. If there are too many MRs, she needs to either ask some to leave or kick some. If someone's not listening to her PMs, she needs to give them a warning in game.


[07-Apr-20 03:58 PM] emma;#1525
She can't just waste people's time, complain, and expect us to baby her


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
deadass


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its annoying how she does this all the time


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we're not her babysitters


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
makes a mistake and wants us to fix it for her


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she really needs to be more independent honestly


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[07-Apr-20 03:59 PM] emma;#1525
why did we even promote her in the first place lol


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
does she have any warnings


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe because her activity seemed high at the time


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or is this her first


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
keep in mind


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
promotions weren't exactly well-thought out back in that time


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] emma;#1525
i mean they were


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya they were


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] emma;#1525
people just had personality switches REAL QUICK


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[07-Apr-20 04:00 PM] emma;#1525
like jack was a GREAT manager and senior


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] emma;#1525
then he got to shift and TF


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] emma;#1525
he turned into godzilla


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then what about matt's promo lol


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] emma;#1525
Matt was good also lmao until he got shift


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that shit was wayyy too quick


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
matt gave me the worst senior promo ever


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
he didnt even tell me rules


[07-Apr-20 04:01 PM] emma;#1525

[07-Apr-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
c:


[07-Apr-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
well bonnie pointed out that you cheated


[07-Apr-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
so i dont feel that bad actually


[07-Apr-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
CHEATED?


[07-Apr-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
how did i cheat


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
so you know how you have the option in each server to mute @/everyone tags, right


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
so when you tag everyone, not everyone actually gets that ping


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
you, however, got around that because you tagged @verified


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
.


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
which you can't suppress


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
so a lot more people saw your ping


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
u rlly think i did that on purpose


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
than saw mine


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
WHY


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
I HAD TO DO THAT


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
i know you didnt bc you aren't that smart


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
or forward thinking


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
i will show u a gif


[07-Apr-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525

like wth discord


[07-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
it didnt only happen to that person


[07-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
i tagged like one poor person 5 times lol


[07-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
but it rlly annoyed me


[07-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
but i was smart and figured out everyone had the verified role


[07-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
so i used that instead as a solution to the problem


[07-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
so yeah üòé


[07-Apr-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596
oh and by the way


[07-Apr-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596
they can also surpress role mentions


[07-Apr-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596

[07-Apr-20 04:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
wait what


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
whats the difference between verbal and written if BOTH get written


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
beanman


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
went over this like


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
nu


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
awhile ago


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we came to the conclusion that


[07-Apr-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
well ur a noob so


[07-Apr-20 04:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its been like this forever and no one knows what the difference is so it just stays like this


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
ok so written warnings come in the form of letters


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
Dear Trey, you are being warned for being a dumbass bitch, love the HR team


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
etc etc


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
VERBAL warnings are usually in game, but they're a "Hey don't do this again"


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
like less formal


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
basically


[07-Apr-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
so most warnings are probably verbal bc we almost never send out formal warnings


[07-Apr-20 04:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[07-Apr-20 04:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we should


[07-Apr-20 04:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
rename it


[07-Apr-20 04:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
formal and unformal


[07-Apr-20 04:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc that makes more sense


[07-Apr-20 04:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[07-Apr-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
if im actually right about the difference LOL


[07-Apr-20 04:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[07-Apr-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
that's what my understanding is but


[07-Apr-20 04:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
makes sense to me lol

[08-Apr-20 10:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's the same thing as 2019 sadly


[08-Apr-20 10:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i want a full fledged event like in 2018


[08-Apr-20 10:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's where they really stepped up their game


[08-Apr-20 10:58 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Its fun


[08-Apr-20 10:58 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I like it all in diff games


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Makes collecting easier


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I hated finding eggs in different maps in an entire egg game


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes is that new?


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye last time u had to teleport


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I never remember it in other games


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Like hub


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ahhh


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Smart


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Desert


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Forest


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] Cam#5887
i miss the hub tho


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Then like jump here and there for egg


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] Cam#5887
i wish there was still a hub


[08-Apr-20 10:59 AM] Cam#5887
and other games


[08-Apr-20 11:00 AM] Cam#5887
cause u could always get the eggmin and star egg easily


[08-Apr-20 11:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i want fifteam to return so badly


[08-Apr-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
I wish there was a hub too but I‚Äôm grateful they still did a egg hunt. They could‚Äôve decided not to do it at all since they cancelled all other events.


[08-Apr-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
So at least they still did one


[08-Apr-20 11:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
2017 and 2018 were still the best years of egg hunt


[08-Apr-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[08-Apr-20 11:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
both of them were so fucking good


[08-Apr-20 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
What we have this year is better than nothing

@High Rank So Lauren accidentally sent this in general discussion and deleted it right after, she said only herself, ella, a former, and one other person saw it, just making you all aware in case you want any action taken. https://gyazo.com/56fa3c0f3fd494bf4f4aea97d8c09b2d

This is something we can discuss during the HR meeting as well


[09-Apr-20 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I do think we need a more reliable way to verify


[09-Apr-20 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
But at the same time, when the bot dies it doesn‚Äôt hurt for people to wait a few hours to verify.

YALL WANTED TO PROMOTE THEM SO FAST


[09-Apr-20 12:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They shouldn‚Äôt go past head tbh


[09-Apr-20 12:40 PM] emma;#1525
this is why we don‚Äôt promote people in a month, like ik it‚Äôs the ‚Äúminimum‚Äù but that‚Äôs so fast


[09-Apr-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525

You can be the security guard


[09-Apr-20 12:42 PM] emma;#1525
People have to get past you to join


[09-Apr-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435

[09-Apr-20 12:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-Apr-20 12:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-Apr-20 12:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They don‚Äôt need to get votes to promo someone


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
its a voting system for a reason üôÑ


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435

[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
tate got 4


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435

[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
hell no


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
5 is a lot of people


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
5 is fine


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
not rly


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
if its 3 then ur not actuakly getting enough opinions


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
well honestly I think we need more heads


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] emma;#1525
5 isn‚Äôt even HALF


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
ramm


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
i could put up


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] emma;#1525
it‚Äôs not hard to get 5 votes


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
some new lr


[09-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
have u and emma vote


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
and boom promoted


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
People just need to remember to VOTE


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
no one else gets an opinion on it


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I‚Äôm confused tho


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
y


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
@bman that‚Äôs why instead of just a vote I want a minimum 24 hour waiting period before they‚Äôre approved


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I think we need to increase maximums on amount of people in ranks


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
So if they get 5 right off the bat people still have time to disagree


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We almost have a million people in the group


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
we arent even close to maximums for mrs...


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming we don‚Äôt have limits on head ranks or managements really


[09-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
lets get closer to those maximums firs


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] emma;#1525
And we aren‚Äôt close to filling the official limit either


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
then see


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
isnt head recep like 100 lol


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
because at one point i was the 100th head revep


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] emma;#1525
Heads are technically all 100 but we‚Äôve gone over that


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] emma;#1525
Management is 50


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] emma;#1525
Senior is 20


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
then 3/4 were demoted


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Actually nvm


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We usually have like 2-3 heads per sever


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
ramm we arent even close to a full mrnteam u noob


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
If there isn‚Äôt a training


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
THATS WHAT I MEAN


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
we need more heads


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
SO WHY WOULD WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT WE CAN HAVE


[09-Apr-20 12:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I thought it was because we were at max


[09-Apr-20 12:46 PM] emma;#1525
I mean we could defo use more heads with summer coming up


[09-Apr-20 12:46 PM] bman#0435
WHEN WE ARENT CLOSE TO THE MAXIMUM


[09-Apr-20 12:46 PM] emma;#1525
Bman calm down omg


[09-Apr-20 12:46 PM] emma;#1525

[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435

[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
2019


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] Cam#5887
but it was recent as well


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
that same proof was used before


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] Cam#5887
correct


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
its from 2019...


[09-Apr-20 06:44 PM] Cam#5887
ik


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think the point she's trying to make is that he hid multiple times


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
it shouldnt be on the card


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cam#5887
i shouldnt ahve added it


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh well


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
u didnt add it


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
jxlly did


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
and idc what her point was


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cam#5887
OH


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
shes been a manager for like


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
nearly a year


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cam#5887
sorry


[09-Apr-20 06:45 PM] bman#0435
and shouldve known better


[09-Apr-20 06:46 PM] bman#0435
it just looks like we suspended someone for something that happened in 2019, with the same proof twice


[09-Apr-20 06:46 PM] bman#0435
maddy's proof is the only valid proof on that card


[09-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cam#5887
YEA


[09-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cam#5887
shit


[09-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cam#5887
caps


[09-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cam#5887
i shouldve said something


[09-Apr-20 06:48 PM] bman#0435
and one of jelly's yt vids is from January


[09-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Cam#5887
YEAH


[09-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Cam#5887
goddamnit


[09-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Cam#5887
sirry


[09-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Cam#5887
im playing a game


[09-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Cam#5887
and caps lock is the push to talk


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cam#5887
so it makes it go caps, but, anyway, yeah


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cam#5887
i shouldve


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cam#5887
seen that on the card, told jelly, removed it, THEN suspend


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cam#5887
due to hiding


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
lol


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
and jelly shouldve known


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
so


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cam#5887
facts


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
i understand her point


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] bman#0435
but like


[09-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cam#5887
especially with being a manager for a year like u said


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
she should have made multiple reports


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
and if this was his 3rd


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
or 4th


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Cam#5887
proof from a year ago, not good


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Cam#5887
yse


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
then he wouldve been fired


[09-Apr-20 06:51 PM] bman#0435
but for some reason she decided not to report it until 5 months later


[09-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
either way


[09-Apr-20 06:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's kind of fucked lol


[09-Apr-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
hes already suspended


[09-Apr-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435

2019 2020 egg hunt is fun


[09-Apr-20 08:42 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I prefer separate games than 1 entire game for it

Why do u have an opinion that is different to mine I'm suing u @PackItUpMack


[09-Apr-20 08:45 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Cause its boring to jump and walk everywhere to find eggs


[09-Apr-20 08:45 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Going to different games to do small stuff is fun


[09-Apr-20 08:46 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
The avengers last yr was good


[09-Apr-20 08:46 PM] bman#0435
the whole point of separate games is so other developers get noticed


[09-Apr-20 08:47 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I wanted to die finding eggs in that huge game


[09-Apr-20 08:47 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I had to follow like every single conor3d vid


[09-Apr-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[09-Apr-20 08:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no


[09-Apr-20 08:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the least they could of done this year like last year was have all the games in the lobby


[09-Apr-20 08:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don‚Äôt like having to look where to go

[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] Polk#1596

there are a few things she has done that we have just been way too lazy to warn her for


[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
It‚Äôs not even raining out


[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Or anything


[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] Polk#1596
ikr im a genius


[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] stacey#1000
Isnt admin abuse a fire?


[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] Tattoblue#5828
She‚Äôs a senior so she should know


[09-Apr-20 08:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
the failing to put passers situation


[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] ethan;#0003
@bman is 2r_i blacklisted?


[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435

[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok I gtg Bc I needa save battery

[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
BYE COOKIE


[09-Apr-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
I mean, she admin abused it's either a long suspension or an immediate termination.


[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; not form what i see


[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
I thought admin abuse was termination.

[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
For sure a long suspension.


[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
but i mean it was only the fly command so im not sure


[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
its not like she flew others


[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
so idk abt going to the extreme of firing


[09-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
I think a 5 day suspension.


[09-Apr-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
alright imma get more opinions before starting a poll of the possible outcomes


[09-Apr-20 09:02 PM] stacey#1000
kk


[09-Apr-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@bman POWERS BACK


[09-Apr-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk what‚Äôs happening with it


[09-Apr-20 09:03 PM] bman#0435
WOOOO


[09-Apr-20 09:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's a suspension for sure.


[09-Apr-20 09:07 PM] stacey#1000
Considering the length of time she's been a senior and an MR alone, she has no excuse against this. She needs to be set in place, as sometimes she appears to act like an HR.


[09-Apr-20 09:08 PM] stacey#1000
Or slacks and thinks she can do whatever she wants.


[09-Apr-20 09:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I feel terminate tho


[09-Apr-20 09:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Shes been let off too easily


[09-Apr-20 09:08 PM] stacey#1000
I mean she's never actually been susended before so.


[09-Apr-20 09:08 PM] stacey#1000
suspended*


[09-Apr-20 09:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But shes been fumbling up a lot lately


[09-Apr-20 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
I think terminate is a bit much, and if she does something like this again after a suspension then for sure terminate and she basically has 0 chance at shift manager for a long time.


[09-Apr-20 09:09 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Maybe shes just eager to build themed sessions


[09-Apr-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
This wasn't at a theme session though.


[09-Apr-20 09:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye thatd why i said


[09-Apr-20 09:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Eager


[09-Apr-20 09:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
She cant wait to fly


[09-Apr-20 09:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
.


[09-Apr-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
She needs a 5 day suspension.


[09-Apr-20 09:12 PM] stacey#1000
She seems to think that because she hosts a server and is in charge of a server that she can do what she wants, such as flying for a "cool picture."


[09-Apr-20 09:13 PM] Polk#1596
1 month suspension


[09-Apr-20 09:13 PM] Polk#1596
am i right @xAfroTrey


[09-Apr-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1 month-


[09-Apr-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
BOI HELL NO


[09-Apr-20 09:14 PM] Polk#1596
it was ur idea to suspend for 1 month


[09-Apr-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
5 day suspension and no chance at shift for a long time, or ever.


[09-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596

[09-Apr-20 09:15 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[09-Apr-20 09:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
damn and maddy was gonna be competition against cam for shift üíÄ


[09-Apr-20 09:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
but we all chose cam


[09-Apr-20 09:15 PM] emma;#1525
bc she's never done anything that bad until recently


[09-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Polk#1596
it wasnt any competition at all


[09-Apr-20 09:16 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Suspension pls


[09-Apr-20 09:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
im glad we chose cam


[09-Apr-20 09:16 PM] emma;#1525
who's suspending


[09-Apr-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[09-Apr-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
i'll do it if no one else wants to


[09-Apr-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
haven't suspended anyone in a while


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Polk#1596
emma have u ever suspended a senior before


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
probably


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
ive suspended a lot of people


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
i've fired many a senior :)


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Polk#1596
i mean


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Polk#1596
cam can do it


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
if cam wants to he can


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Polk#1596
if not then u can


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Polk#1596
@Cam


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
hence why i said "if anyone else wants to they can"


[09-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Polk#1596
might be a bit harsh to suspend a senior for the first time but


[09-Apr-20 09:19 PM] Polk#1596
here's ur chance


[09-Apr-20 09:19 PM] stacey#1000

[09-Apr-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
1) remove them from all boards


[09-Apr-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
2) suspend them


[09-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
3) update them in discord


[09-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
4) send letter


[09-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
that's the order you should be doing it in üôÑ


[09-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
5) make a card on the HR board with proof and set a due date


[09-Apr-20 09:21 PM] Cam#5887
ok


[09-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
i cant wait to roast 3/4 of the BOD team at this HR meeting

[09-Apr-20 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
make letter first and send it here so we can help you with it


[09-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Polk#1596
false alarm


[09-Apr-20 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
never remove her from all boards or anything until the letter is ready


[09-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Polk#1596
oh u meant like that


[09-Apr-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
letters are so easy


[09-Apr-20 09:23 PM] stacey#1000
so then u can send it right away after she is suspended


[09-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Polk#1596
i thought u meant for the letter


[09-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Polk#1596
then yes, you remove them from senior board, application board, management board, suspend their rank on bloxton discord, remove all of their other roles as well, make a card on the HR board with all the evidence, due date, etc (better version of what emma said)


[09-Apr-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525
[blank], you are being suspended for [x] days due to an instance of [x] and the [game name]. As you should know, this behavior is unacceptable from our MRs and will not be tolerated if the instance repeats itself. Please take this time during your suspension to reflect on your actions so you can come back ready to take on your responsibilities again. Your suspension will be lifted on [month] [date] at [time]. Let me know if you have any questions. -signed whatever


[09-Apr-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525
but like format it better


[09-Apr-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525

Greetings, Maddqy.

Due to using the fly command in the Bloxton Training Center without any permission, you will be suspended for 5 days starting as of April 9, 2020 at 10:20 PM CST. The suspension will lift on April 14, 2020 at 10:20 PM CST. Your actions with the "fly" command are deemed unacceptable and this behavior is not tolerated as an MR. Please use the following time to focus how to improve, and to possibly think over your actions again. 

Sincerely,
cam_s

If you do not ask for permission, it will be considered as admin abuse. As a Senior Management, we expected you to be aware of this kind of behavior being not tolerated. We would like you to use the following time...

@High Rank Reminder that the Q&A is tomorrow at 12 PM CST. I'd really like for as many of you to be there as possible. If I could get at least 2-3 of you **who are willing to talk** in the VC that would be great, and the more of you who show (even if you aren't talking) the better, y'all can answer questions in the Q&A channel if you aren't talking. Please react to this message if you're planning on going so I can get a general headcount, and since it's a VC and text channel "I can't go bc I have a stapleton shift" is not a valid excuse not to at least show up for 30 minutes so please come or I'll be very mad at you :) Thanks!!

[09-Apr-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
she clearly wasn't using fly to just "move something"


[09-Apr-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
i mean it looks like she was using admin to get people posed for a picture


[09-Apr-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
which is nonessential


[09-Apr-20 11:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809

how the actual fuck can you accidentally leave a group


[10-Apr-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
U HAVE TO HIT A CONFIRMATION BUTTON


[10-Apr-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
give it her back ig but tell her not to do it again @ethan;


[10-Apr-20 07:06 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
uhm


[10-Apr-20 07:06 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
didnt we agree when u leave u dont get it back üòÇ


[10-Apr-20 07:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well I mean if it was an accident we rank back but how does she leave the group üíÄ


[10-Apr-20 07:08 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
u cant accidentally leave the group


[10-Apr-20 07:08 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
u literally have to press like three buttons


[10-Apr-20 07:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk what she did


[10-Apr-20 07:08 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
roblox doesnt just automatically kick u out of a group

like-


[10-Apr-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
She‚Äôs either lying or she was hacked


[10-Apr-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[10-Apr-20 07:10 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she wouldve told us if she was hacked


[10-Apr-20 07:10 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
it wouldve literally messaged her saying someone was using her account


[10-Apr-20 07:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
tbh i dont believe her cause u have to confirm leaving so...


[10-Apr-20 07:11 PM] ethan;#0003
shes a little


[10-Apr-20 07:11 PM] ethan;#0003
brain damaged


[10-Apr-20 07:11 PM] ethan;#0003
lets put it that way


[10-Apr-20 07:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
what


[10-Apr-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
best way to put it @ethan;


[10-Apr-20 07:13 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
..


[10-Apr-20 07:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe she lagged and accidentally left the group


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that happened to me at one point but


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
just an educational guess


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
i mean


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
artyphos


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
did this


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
3 times


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
in 2 months


[10-Apr-20 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
when i was hr


[10-Apr-20 07:15 PM] emma;#1525
She doesn‚Äôt need to lie and be like ‚ÄúI was randomly kicked out‚Äù thoigh


[10-Apr-20 07:15 PM] emma;#1525
Though


[10-Apr-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's kind of putting the blame against the hr team


[10-Apr-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not a fan of that


[10-Apr-20 07:16 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
idk for some reason i just dont trust her


[10-Apr-20 07:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I honestly almost left the other day too cause I was trying to rank real fast and before audit logs used to always be on the bottom of the control panel and I clicked ‚ÄúLeave group‚Äù but I of course got the confirmation lol


[10-Apr-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i left by accident cause my laptop froze lol


[10-Apr-20 07:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and i had no idea what the hell was going on


[10-Apr-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
judging by my specs of my older laptop, i see why


[10-Apr-20 07:18 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but she said it kicked her out


[10-Apr-20 07:18 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
she never said anything about accidentally leaving


[10-Apr-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
makes no sense at all


[10-Apr-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
found my older laptop specs


[10-Apr-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're horrible lol

WELL IDK THOUGH cause i feel like its too much trouble to LOG out and LOG in as my alt


[10-Apr-20 09:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
plus i look like a noob


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
if that is all you care about


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
then i'd suggest having two browsers


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
for example


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
google chrome for bloo


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
then use opera or something and log in as ur alt there


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
then you just open opera and then you dont have to do anything


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
very easy method


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
but i wouldnt do it bloo


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596
criminals can apply class 53, its class 52 rn


[10-Apr-20 09:15 PM] Polk#1596

[10-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[10-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[10-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Polk#1596
no u cant


[10-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Polk#1596
u can apply for class 52


[10-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Polk#1596
if u have an alt account which is clean


[10-Apr-20 09:16 PM] Polk#1596
and can like pass the background check


[10-Apr-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; do u tell interviewers to kick people for saying "a" instead of "an" on the grammar test


[10-Apr-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[10-Apr-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
because apparently kiki did it to this former mr, and we cant go strict on that


[10-Apr-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
well i never specified


[10-Apr-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
i never said they could and i never said they cant


[10-Apr-20 09:29 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think its a big deal, ill just remind her not to be too strict when it comes to that


[10-Apr-20 09:30 PM] bman#0435
im just telling u since ik we arent supposed to be strict on ints


[10-Apr-20 09:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i kick for a and an tho


[10-Apr-20 09:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
.


[10-Apr-20 09:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but i dont use that grammar test anymore


[10-Apr-20 09:33 PM] stacey#1000
We be discussing interview guidelines during HR meeting


[10-Apr-20 09:34 PM] bman#0435
yes]


[10-Apr-20 09:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i do lol


[10-Apr-20 09:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what was the sentence anyways @bman


[10-Apr-20 09:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wanna know what she was dealing with


[10-Apr-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435
idk


[10-Apr-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; ^


[10-Apr-20 09:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think really


[10-Apr-20 09:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it depends on the sentence


[10-Apr-20 09:36 PM] ethan;#0003
h3llo, my name is __ and i is h3re to get as int3rview.


[10-Apr-20 09:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ya both ways are fine


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
eh we shouldn't be that strict on interview tests


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
a and an is something small


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
in themed sessions do we need grammar


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
shouldn't fail someone for it, maybe just pass & remind


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if the trainee is gone


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
host preference


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and we are just playing games


[10-Apr-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
@a. ·É¶


[10-Apr-20 09:50 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@bman bman'


[10-Apr-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821

[10-Apr-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
i was talking to u


[10-Apr-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
i answered ur question, its host preference


[10-Apr-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
ya i said since training is over we dont need it


[10-Apr-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
were playing a few games now


[10-Apr-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah just make sure u try and enforce grammar while trainees are present


[10-Apr-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause its still technically a session


[10-Apr-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
but after its fine


[10-Apr-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
ya no trainees r here

[11-Apr-20 08:18 AM] bonnie591#0591

[11-Apr-20 08:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
its better in the long term


[11-Apr-20 08:18 AM] bonnie591#0591

[11-Apr-20 08:43 AM] bonnie591#0591

I don't think there's a limit but


[11-Apr-20 10:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You usually rely on Baby and Bear giving the role

bro adopt me is growing so fast @Beartikal


[11-Apr-20 10:39 AM] bonnie591#0591
why is adopt me so popular


[11-Apr-20 10:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[11-Apr-20 10:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
egg hunt boosted its numbers so that's one


[11-Apr-20 10:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
two, the game is pretty easy to run


[11-Apr-20 10:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
three, the game is pretty well-designed


[11-Apr-20 10:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
developers really need to look at adopt me under a spotlight and take a look, because that is shocking


[11-Apr-20 10:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
four, loads of mechanics such as trading


[11-Apr-20 10:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
trey


[11-Apr-20 10:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Are there even a million people online rn I‚Äôve never seen a game over 250k playing


[11-Apr-20 10:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
probably


[11-Apr-20 10:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's coronacation


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm probably gonna research bloxlink and see how it works @bonnie591


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
then probably form an opinion


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
okay


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
its basically same as rover


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
u can add binds


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
for ranks


[11-Apr-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
omg


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm ok


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] stacey#1000
tbh ive never even seen a  game pass adopt me for a long time, like with amount of players on


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
PLUS


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
IT DOESNT GO DOWN


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
EVERY


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
SINGLE


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
DAY


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know we're gonna have some work to do with the binding tho


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
i can do it


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
ive got nothing better to do


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i can probably help too


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
and the satisfaction of boycotting rover :


[11-Apr-20 10:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
üòè


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i did a bit of binding before with cyto


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
the problem is during transition


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
my plan is


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
give everyone 24 hours


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
to reverify with bloxlink


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
rename the current roles to a different name like recep


[11-Apr-20 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
make new roles like receptionist


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
and then


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
after 24 hours


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
people cant view server unless they reverify


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
through the new bot


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
so for first 24-48 hours people can see without reverifying so we're not so bad


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
also


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
we're gonna let mrs verify first, then a lr rank at a time


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
to avoid


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
mass overflows


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
in requests


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think 48 hours seems like a better option


[11-Apr-20 10:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
a lot more time to get used to the bot


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think we shoul rename the roles when we do it to recep from receptionist then make new roles etc


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] emma;#1525
I don‚Äôt like how we have a meeting in 14 minutes and only 2 of you are like actively online


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] emma;#1525
people better show up!!


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill show up


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
for first 30 mins


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
so


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
can i discuss what i want to discuss


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
first pls


[11-Apr-20 10:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
@emma;


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] emma;#1525
Sure ig


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
the stress of senios


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
seniors


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok uh


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's going to be debatable if we're discussing about that


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
YE


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
ye


[11-Apr-20 10:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
im just thinking


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
if we could like let managements do some things seniors do atm to make their responsibility less since we give them a lot of shit to do


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
and they seem to be getting a little tired


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] emma;#1525
uh like what


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
idk


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] emma;#1525
ok...


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
this is just an example im not too supportive of the idea


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
but


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
its an idea


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
apps can be read my management?


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] emma;#1525
maybe think of one thing to support it lol


[11-Apr-20 10:48 AM] emma;#1525
Oh god no


[11-Apr-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525
We already have issues with seniors hogging apps all the time


[11-Apr-20 10:49 AM] emma;#1525
Imagine having 50 people reading them


[11-Apr-20 10:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think they should have that type of responsibility


[11-Apr-20 10:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
hm ok


[11-Apr-20 10:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
its just


[11-Apr-20 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
we trust them at interviews and when the app center is open for weeks and weeks seniors seem to get tired


[11-Apr-20 10:50 AM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Y‚Äôall better be here in 10 minutes, or Bonnie will fire you

@High Rank how many seniors do u usually get compared to servers


[11-Apr-20 11:06 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[11-Apr-20 11:07 AM] Polk#1596

I'd fit in with everyone because I love socializing and talking to the guests. **mrs fail for the second one cause theres not three sentences, but pass the first one**

[11-Apr-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Make sure you don't rush into decisions though, make sure you have HRs agreeing and understanding what's being implemented


[11-Apr-20 11:58 AM] Polk#1596
unless it is from the whole team


[11-Apr-20 11:59 AM] bman#0435

ok so for promotions


[11-Apr-20 11:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Promotions i think it shud be 5


[11-Apr-20 11:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Strict 5


[11-Apr-20 11:59 AM] bman#0435
i dont like how some get wpproved at 4


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] bman#0435
or how some dont even get voted


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
5 is a percentage of the HRs which are active


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't think we need to change that


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
oooo


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
First 24 hours nomination, 5 days voting, final decision?


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] bman#0435
no


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] bman#0435
not 5 day voting


[11-Apr-20 12:00 PM] xM_inn#2821

[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
-_-


[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think we should leave promotions up for 1-2 days even if they do get 5 votes


[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I agree with that Emma


[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
hm okay


[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[11-Apr-20 12:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Does it still need approval after 5 votes


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] bman#0435
i check everyday


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
WELL


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
isnt it


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
technically


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
4 votes


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@Cooqkie well if u get 5 votes for now


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc the person who adds the card


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's 5 votes


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
votes anyway


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
Or you can promote earlier with BOD approval


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so then u just need 4 other people


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
That's how it was


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so technically isnt it 4 votes?


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] bman#0435
no i dont like bod approval for promotions


[11-Apr-20 12:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
bod approval shouldnt be with the promotions tbh


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] bman#0435
because ur getting no one elses opinions


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] bman#0435
other than that bod


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
Not necessarily


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
BOD approval was given for when we had 3-4 votes


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
So there was opinions


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
So you can't really say that


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but 3-4 votes isnt 5


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes but it was still an opinion


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if 3 votes out of like 16 hrs for a promotion


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
clearly thats not


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
enough


[11-Apr-20 12:03 PM] bman#0435
mack could be asleep when someone gets a bod approval and mack could know valid reasons y they shoulsnt be promoted


[11-Apr-20 12:04 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

Im not really in touch with the ppl nowadays


[11-Apr-20 12:04 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i justr think that 5 votes is also too little


[11-Apr-20 12:04 PM] bman#0435

yeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyey


[11-Apr-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so


[11-Apr-20 12:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
with that, do you guys wanna host another session **IF** needed. like say a hr or senior can‚Äôt host and you come to that point where u wanna host that other server? but it comes with rules @High Rank


[11-Apr-20 12:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
you're allowed to plan and host ur own events as long as it's been approved by a BOD -- dont complain about the BOD approval thing for this as no other HR has ever hosted an event before soo @bman


[11-Apr-20 12:27 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
yES


[11-Apr-20 12:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

WELL THATS DIFFERENT


[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont get what u said


[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
here are the rules Polk made


[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
- no trainings after that session for 1.5-2 hours
- no seniors OR HRs can host
- at least 2-3 management in that server to ensure everything is running correctly (may vary depending on the size of the server)
- the hr will be available AT ALL TIMES with their DMs open
- the HR will be changing servers every 5-10 minutes
- try not to make your session last like 2 hours in total


[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg


[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I fake afk


[11-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Polk#1596
1 management every 10 players


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
theres like 50 players..


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
story


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well story at the end there‚Äôs really only less than 30 people


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
once everyone gets kicked


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
WAIT


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
its 30


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
OH


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
would that


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
IM SO DUMB


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So that‚Äôs basically 3 managers


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
count as 2 sessions?


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
HAHA


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if ur hosting 2 servers?


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
in other words, 2-3 managements per server


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well basically cause ur adding the server @Cooqkie


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
yes?


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yes


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
it is just a last resort


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
with strict rules


[11-Apr-20 12:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that means we log twice?


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i think that getting paid for second servers is dumb because a lot of hrs dont even rank their passers


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Polk#1596
because theres no point hosting the final server when theres a training 1 hour after


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we get paid for second servers?


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think admin acts should be paid too


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
okay I need to go and do stuff for Sizzle now, make sure to send me the document of everything discussed so i can read it later

[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
A lot


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Polk#1596
no, you can only log once if you do that


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bruh


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but like hrs dont even RANK their passers


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Polk#1596
its just a last resort, not a way to cheat ur way to more logs


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ADMIN ACTSSSSSSSS


[11-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809

ADMIN ACTSSSSS


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
admin acts


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ya


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
r more important


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
than hosting sessions


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah I agree with that Emma


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ya i think like what emma said at the qna we all do different stuff behind the scenes


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I find it nice to clear


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Polk#1596
i used to do that every week


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont dont we should be paid based off second servers


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Polk#1596
300-500 admin acts every week


[11-Apr-20 12:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u dont dont ethan


[11-Apr-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I just do 30+ Admin Acts | cleared everything thats suppose to be done | 10am-1pm or smth


[11-Apr-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ya they have human resourced


[11-Apr-20 12:32 PM] Polk#1596
so ur saying you want kinda like departments, specialized in hosting, specialized in admin acts? @emma;


[11-Apr-20 12:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i have a question about the ban requests @emma;


[11-Apr-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye i tink its good if we are paid in what we do


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i like admin acts


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Polk#1596
for checklists


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Not just sessions


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
whats the point of ban requests at the IC and TC


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Polk#1596
ok i can agree with that


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if the person is udner both lists


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they might as well be blacklisted?


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
let‚Äôs bring that up with other bods @Polk


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
omfg i‚Äôm so sorry guys


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Bans at hotel or suspensions and fires are as essential as sessions


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I like that idea


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Polk#1596
but yeah firstly we would need to speak with baby


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
i‚Äôm not feeling well and i fell back asleep


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
its OK CAM


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Polk#1596
because the sessions pay thing has been like that for ages


[11-Apr-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah we need to let baby know if we‚Äôre not gonna get paid off sessions


[11-Apr-20 12:34 PM] Cam#5887
i‚Äôll join right now


[11-Apr-20 12:34 PM] Polk#1596
but the specialized in blabla thing is something i agree on


[11-Apr-20 12:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i like that


[11-Apr-20 12:34 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
id rather do like 60 admin acts than reading tickets

I don't think we should be paid off second servers because for example, someone will host 10 sessions at a bad time, and someone will host 2 sessions at a good time. They both got 10 servers so they get paid the same amount but the person who hosted 10 sessions did a lot more work but they still get the same amount


[11-Apr-20 12:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[11-Apr-20 12:52 PM] bman#0435

[11-Apr-20 12:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 12:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 01:05 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez If there‚Äôs already 8 MRs at interviews, or 4 heads and 3 managers at trainings, then any other MRs who join need to serverhop.

If you join a server before the limit is reached, you‚Äôre expected to stay on that server unless it‚Äôs not being hosted or you get permission to leave by the host.


[11-Apr-20 01:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok got it


[11-Apr-20 01:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and send it to the chat too


[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
verbal


[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think he should be warned


[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] ethan;#0003
just a reminder


[11-Apr-20 10:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
well


[11-Apr-20 10:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
someone needs to tell him not to do it


[11-Apr-20 10:06 PM] bman#0435
ya i dont think hed get warnewd for that


[11-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i guess


[11-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[11-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
someone still needs to tell him to not do that


[11-Apr-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Apr-20 10:10 PM] bman#0435

@High Rank anyone against CatShooketh and thvomas on getting former MR role?


[11-Apr-20 11:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They've kind of messed around a bit today, to be fairly honest.


[11-Apr-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
tbh im iffy since they were banned for cursing and it wasnt the first time, if im not mistaken


[11-Apr-20 11:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's a couple of things I don't like about the two of them.


[11-Apr-20 11:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I agree. @bman


[11-Apr-20 11:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think I remember Tomo saying something stupid then excusing it by saying he was "hacked".


[11-Apr-20 11:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They've also got a bit demanding of the role which I don't like, a bit uncomfortable to be honest.


[11-Apr-20 11:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cat isn't that better either, I remember her trash talking Darren a while back and acting a bit sassy w/ me. She also was kind of disrespectful during the yacht session.


[11-Apr-20 11:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm friends with them and all, but they need to actually show us they deserve the roles.


[11-Apr-20 11:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think they need more time tbh, their maturity ain't so hot either. @bman


[11-Apr-20 11:40 PM] bman#0435
ight i agree


[11-Apr-20 11:42 PM] emma;#1525
@bman they've been encouraging people (i.e. kyle mainly) to behave pretty badly lol


[11-Apr-20 11:42 PM] emma;#1525
and their behavior hasn't been so good themselves


[11-Apr-20 11:43 PM] emma;#1525
i let soccer appeal and he didnt take it seriously so i denied his appeal lol


[11-Apr-20 11:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think you remember this Emma, but I think Cat acted way out of line during your themed session.


[11-Apr-20 11:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Honestly, I don't think she was ever that mature.

omg yay thanks bear!! @Beartikal


[12-Apr-20 12:21 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@High Rank thanks to mr @Beartikal now that we have the hr announcements channel, we can now announce things in there and voting should be easier instead of having to scroll


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] bman#0435
is that the voting channel


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
uh


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
voting channel was supposed to be its own thing


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
precisely so it doesn't get mixed up with announcements and other taga


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
tags


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Wait so what‚Äôs the new channel for


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal can you pls make a channel called voting


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
thats separate


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
why can‚Äôt we vote in there


[12-Apr-20 12:22 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it wouldn‚Äôt really get lost


[12-Apr-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
i just thought we all agreed to have a channel specifically for voting


[12-Apr-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
HRs tag stuff like... 10 times a day


[12-Apr-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
and we usually only vote 1-2 times a day


[12-Apr-20 12:24 AM] bman#0435
*bonnie tags us


[12-Apr-20 12:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought that‚Äôs was the announcements was for just announce votings or just basic knowledge ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[12-Apr-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
ok ig we can try it like this and then add another channel if needed


[12-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000

[12-Apr-20 04:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887

[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
honestly


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
he seemed extremely sorry


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
just by messaging me


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
every single day


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] bman#0435
no thats called begging LOL


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
and he kept saying how he was actually very sorry and didnt know it was major spam


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
im aware


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
but


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
just seemed like he actually cared


[12-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cam#5887
and actually wanted to work here


[12-Apr-20 04:27 PM] Cam#5887
in which


[12-Apr-20 04:27 PM] Cam#5887
he just passed ints


[12-Apr-20 04:27 PM] Cam#5887
as he told me


[12-Apr-20 04:27 PM] Cam#5887
so i just decided to accept it


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
imma be honest with u


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
i feel like u just accepted the appeal so he didnt annoy u any further


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] Cam#5887
actually no


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
because i know if he didnt message u everyday about it


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
u probably would have declined


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] Cam#5887
he really didnt


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] Cam#5887
i told him to stop


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] Cam#5887
and he did


[12-Apr-20 04:28 PM] Cam#5887
and just asked about it like every 3 days ish


[12-Apr-20 04:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's still not good lol


[12-Apr-20 04:29 PM] Cam#5887
im aware


[12-Apr-20 04:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he shouldn't be asking in that time frame at all


[12-Apr-20 04:29 PM] Cam#5887

[12-Apr-20 04:29 PM] Cam#5887

[12-Apr-20 08:06 PM] bman#0435
ace thought it was a good idea to leave quwanterz' server for omer's server without permission so i told omer not to let her in since she never got permission and that he can name on his own since its not something new


[12-Apr-20 08:09 PM] bman#0435
SHE WENT BACK TO QUWANTERZ SERVER AFTER NOT BEING ABLE TO GO TO OMER'S üíÄ

We can prune more people once we deleted the old verified role when we've transferred to the other bot @emma;


[12-Apr-20 08:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
Because peopel who haven't been on for 30+ days won't have any roles if we delete the roles


[12-Apr-20 08:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
We'll have to do a vote of course to see if we care about how many members we have

WAIt


[12-Apr-20 11:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
how r we gonna do


[12-Apr-20 11:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Talkative roles


[12-Apr-20 11:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
If we have a new bot for verification?


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
same way we always have


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] bman#0435
when is easter stuf fin bburg coming out :C


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
ticket bot isn't connected to the verification bots


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] bman#0435
no emma because bonnie is switching roles


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
they'll just have to have the bloxlink "verification" role


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
how does that affect talkative though


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
i thought he was switching staff roles only


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] bman#0435
hes changing permissions and such


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
like making a big staff role


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] bman#0435
no its every roll


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] bman#0435
role


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
I've added a new role called "Bloxton Employee" this is so it's easier to add perms to view channels instead of going through individual roles.


[12-Apr-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
how is that gonna affect people who aren't employees lol


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
the verified and talkative roles...


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
thats what im talking about rn...


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
nothing abt staff lol


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ur


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] emma;#1525
ya cookie asked how they're gonna change...


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But*


[12-Apr-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Isn‚Äôt one of the


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
but it's not changing as far as how the process will work... once we get new roles...


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Commands 2 see how old their account is for the old bot


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
they'll verify with bloxlink.... then they'll have access to the tickets channels.... and submit a ticket....


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
and we'll give them talkative...


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
bloxlink does that


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
since it's connected to their accounts


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Is it gonna be a different command


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
probably


[12-Apr-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[13-Apr-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525

[13-Apr-20 02:19 PM] bman#0435
i forgot to mention during the meeting


[13-Apr-20 02:19 PM] bman#0435
insctive notices can be loopholes to keeping ur rank


[13-Apr-20 02:19 PM] bman#0435
some people have a notice and no end date to it


[13-Apr-20 02:19 PM] bman#0435
meaning they can be inactive as long as theyd like and can keep their rank because they have a noticr


[13-Apr-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs true


[13-Apr-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
They need to keep updating that too


[13-Apr-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
Otherwise it‚Äôs a declined notice


[13-Apr-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
fr example


[13-Apr-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435

[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you can but like


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
a ban and blacklist are different appeals


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it depends on the card


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
which one can't she appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
both lol


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
the disc ban, her hotel ban, her blacklist?


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
all of the above


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she pretty much fucked up


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
can you show us where you told her that


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
instead of"she asked afterwards and i said no"


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] bman#0435
so she cant get any appeals whatsoever?


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
She is trying to appeal for the discord


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hell no


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
trey show us where you told her that


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
please


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll check but uh


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
don't give her any appeals


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
if you didn't tell her she couldn't appeal, then that statement isn't valid trey lol


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
we can't just decide 4 months later not to let her appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
so go find where you told her that


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
please


[13-Apr-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
before we have a case on our hands


[13-Apr-20 02:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh emma


[13-Apr-20 02:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i have plenty of good reasons not to let her appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:48 PM] emma;#1525
trey you need to SHOW ME where you told her she could not appeal anything after 30 days


[13-Apr-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
fair enough lemme see


[13-Apr-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
if you actually told her that like you just said you did


[13-Apr-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
it's not a problem


[13-Apr-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so i can't find it here


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i do recall her having 2 alt accounts in the server


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
ok so you didn't tell her she couldn't appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
sorry but we can't decide 4 months after terminating someone that they suddenly can't appeal...

im concerned


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey if she asks again just let her appeal and we can always deny it


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
who


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh no thanks


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
omg ramm


[13-Apr-20 02:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
who even has time for that


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey are you not listening


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's why i think so


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
you didn't tell her she couldn't appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
so


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
she has the right to appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
if you didnt want her to appeal you could have told her that 4 months ago


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i told her today and she didn't react well


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
so let her appeal and we can say no but i'm not dealing with a case of "i was never told i couldnt appeal and i feel like trey is targeting me"


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] emma;#1525
bc you know why


[13-Apr-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
She already contacted me about it


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
emma we know what happened to her


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
you told her in your letter "I hope you learn from these mistakes", didn't tell her she couldn't appeal, so it looks like you were lying in your letter and you don't want her to grow from her mistakes


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
ik thats not what your intention was at all


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
that's just how she's going to interpret it lol


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean she didn't get better lol


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
trey what is the big deal of letting her appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
we can literally deny it


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she literally was harassing kenzi


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming THAT MESSAGE SOUNDS LIKE A CALL FOR SOME EMOTIONAL HELP LMAO


[13-Apr-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
and she can't go around saying you are targeting her


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
or lying to her


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
its a win win


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kenzi didn't respond to her and well


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
read it for yourself


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
i did and it looks like pup tried to send an apology


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
kenzi doesn't have to accept it if she doesn't want to


[13-Apr-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
doesn't change the fact that it was apparently sent

[13-Apr-20 02:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
did you see these @emma;


[13-Apr-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525
you are missing my poiinnnttttt


[13-Apr-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525
if she was never told she couldn't appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525
then she has the same rights as literally


[13-Apr-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525
ANYONE ELSE


[13-Apr-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525
who isn't told they can't appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:55 PM] emma;#1525
these are valid reasons to deny an appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:56 PM] emma;#1525
not valid reasons for you to decide 4 months after her termination that she is unable to appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[13-Apr-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she was acting really bitter to kenzi and apple


[13-Apr-20 02:56 PM] emma;#1525
as HRs it is our responsibility to communicate to people the exact punishments they are receiving


[13-Apr-20 02:56 PM] stacey#1000
Since she messaged me about this trey I see no reason why she can‚Äôt send me an appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the main problem with her is


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] emma;#1525
her punishments as told by you are that she was fired, banned, and blacklisted


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] stacey#1000
We can deny it


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] emma;#1525
not that she was unable to appeal


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] stacey#1000
It I‚Äôm going to let her send me one


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she is very inconsistent with which stance she's going with


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
one minute she's insulting me and then she decides to apologize like an hour or two later


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey bruh I don't like what she's done either and have no intention of passing her appeal but the fact that me and stacey seem to agree on is that you never told her she couldn't appeal so next time if you want someone to not have appeal chances, you need to tell them that from the get go


[13-Apr-20 02:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
doesn't that seem kind of strange


[13-Apr-20 02:58 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm letting her send me an appeal there is no issue with it if she was never told


[13-Apr-20 02:58 PM] emma;#1525
bc part of her bad behavior i can guarentee is stemming from the fact that she's upset with you for not giving her the fair chance to appeal that she (correctly) thought she had because she was never told she couldn't


[13-Apr-20 02:58 PM] stacey#1000
Not saying we have to accept it


[13-Apr-20 02:58 PM] emma;#1525
ofc that's not where her bad attitude towards kenzi is coming from


[13-Apr-20 02:58 PM] emma;#1525
that's just her being her


[13-Apr-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
There I told her ‚ÄúYes, you can send me an appeal.‚Äù


[13-Apr-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
So too late now


[13-Apr-20 02:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's going to bomb


[13-Apr-20 02:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but that's just me


[13-Apr-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
It will likely be denied but she at least deserves the chance to send one


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she had 20 accounts that cb'ed at the hotel


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
She doesn‚Äôt know why she can‚Äôt appeal because you never told her she couldn‚Äôt


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
Ik that‚Äôs why she was fired


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
But you still never told her she can‚Äôt appeal


[13-Apr-20 03:00 PM] emma;#1525
no she was fired for leaking info and having alts that recommended her apparently


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000
And alts the CBed


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000
I thought


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] emma;#1525
that's not what trey toldher


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435
i like how she goes from saying bloxton is toxic to then wanting to appeal


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] emma;#1525
in her term letter


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] emma;#1525
ya that's how it goes bman lol all these formers hate us but once they realize a few of their friends are in the disc they want back in


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] emma;#1525
and suddenly they're sorry for the choices they made


[13-Apr-20 03:01 PM] emma;#1525
üôÑ


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] bman#0435
are they antisocial enough to not make other friends on roblox? üôÑüôÑ


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000
Well we can all see what type of appeal she sends them I can tell her it‚Äôs denied


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000
Then*


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
selma resigned ???????


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] emma;#1525
no they just want to flex on us that they hate us but are in our discord


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000
huh


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i did tell her she was cb'ing


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she even asked me to post proof


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and she "accidentally" left the group a few days ago??


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] bman#0435
i feel like its clear what her intentions are if we appeal her


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ü§î


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000
Well after she sends me an appeal and I deny it I‚Äôll tell her then she cannot appeal again


[13-Apr-20 03:02 PM] bman#0435
she resigned from family issues


[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey not in her termination letter...?


[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435

[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
***"I am writing this letter today to announce your termination here at Bloxton Hotels, due to many comments of you disclosing information of being a circumventor/troller."***


[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
I doubt alloe will ever make it to HR


[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435
same


[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
alloe is rly active


[13-Apr-20 03:03 PM] emma;#1525

something might have gone wrong with the bot


[13-Apr-20 03:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[13-Apr-20 06:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah it is lol


[13-Apr-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
i tried doing that investigation and min asked me for the stuff i got and the questions but didnt help


[13-Apr-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
no one helped me


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what about emma


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] emma;#1525
i helped you a lot but ok


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i was so confused when you said that lol


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
and it was literally just a stupid trap since vac has no proof of anything, wxter has all the proof, and vac said he was seduced by him üôÑ


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
@emma; ya just u but we didnt draw a conclusion to it


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] emma;#1525
did you offer a solution to it


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
vac has NO proof to defend himself


[13-Apr-20 06:25 PM] emma;#1525
like if you thought it warranted a termination or not


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she helped us sort of figure out wxter's tatics lol


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
no i asked for help on it


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
because i didnt know what to do


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] emma;#1525
bc we'll never come to a conclusion if you don't even suggest one lol


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] emma;#1525
that's what votes are for


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
min asked me for the questions and his answers


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
and i assumed he wouldve helped


[13-Apr-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
but he ignored it


[13-Apr-20 06:27 PM] emma;#1525
welcome to the life of investigations


[13-Apr-20 06:27 PM] emma;#1525
people who aren't in charge of them forget about them as soon as the next thing comes up


[13-Apr-20 06:27 PM] emma;#1525
so you have to keep pushing it until we reach a conclusion


[13-Apr-20 06:27 PM] emma;#1525
can't be afraid of spamming people

[13-Apr-20 09:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what


[13-Apr-20 09:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
I hope you are ready to spend a few hours on your fsp application


[13-Apr-20 09:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how long did you spend on it


[13-Apr-20 09:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Because the fsp application is more aimed at people who know shit or former leos


[13-Apr-20 09:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
In honesty around 3-5 hours


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
....


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok I‚Äôm not applying


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well it's because I need to be certain


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's worth it if u get in


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Scso app is way easier but fsp is the better department


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Bloo_Berriez


[13-Apr-20 09:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
U just gotta shown u want fsp if u apply


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
By putting time into the app


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so is FSP application why u wanna be a FSP there


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
or by knowledge


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Knowledge


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Scso is why u want to be scso and about urself


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Fsp is that plus knowledge


[13-Apr-20 09:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Bloo_Berriez


[13-Apr-20 09:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
But the reward is asu!


[13-Apr-20 09:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u get into fsp


[13-Apr-20 09:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
did anyone help u with ur app


[13-Apr-20 09:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like minn or Polk


[13-Apr-20 09:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
If ur not obsessed about asu and just want to get into fsp for a laugh however I'd recommend starting with scso but I'd rather have u in fsp!


[13-Apr-20 09:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
No


[13-Apr-20 09:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[13-Apr-20 09:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Btw


[13-Apr-20 09:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u do fsp app


[13-Apr-20 09:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Do it on a Google doc


[13-Apr-20 09:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Apps go to a trello.com card


[13-Apr-20 09:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[13-Apr-20 10:17 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
well we needa investigate it cause we cant just assume maddy didnt, like its unlikely maddy would do that to herself but we still needa look into it


[13-Apr-20 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
and plus we need to question maddy before continuing


[13-Apr-20 10:18 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Apr-20 03:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
im willing to announce ally events


[14-Apr-20 03:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
since i did once


[14-Apr-20 03:48 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
.


[14-Apr-20 03:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
okay well if people dont step up their game u can have a representative spot


[14-Apr-20 03:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye i felt bad for the koala cafe rep for waiting so long since nobody went to announce it


[14-Apr-20 03:56 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn tbt to when I kept asking for allied rep spots but two specific people always claimed them first ü§≠ü§≠


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
üëÄ


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] emma;#1525
ü•¥


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] emma;#1525
anyways


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i also want allied spots


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
bman alr has sizzle


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
stacey and me dont have any


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm only an allied rep at glazin


[14-Apr-20 03:57 AM] emma;#1525
and they‚Äôve only asked us to announce like one thing lol


[14-Apr-20 04:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
u dont only announce if they ask u to


[14-Apr-20 04:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
u announce whenever they put an event announcement that they're hosting in their discord


[14-Apr-20 04:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
they dont need to ask


[14-Apr-20 04:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
for example like 400k milestone event?


[14-Apr-20 04:06 AM] xM_inn#2821
idk who hosted that but sure


[14-Apr-20 04:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
koala


[14-Apr-20 04:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but its over


[14-Apr-20 04:06 AM] xM_inn#2821
sizzle events arent a big problem as i know in advance when they're being hosted so im able to announce them most times


[14-Apr-20 04:06 AM] xM_inn#2821
but it'd help if a sizzle rep announced them for me too


[14-Apr-20 04:07 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn glazin puts an event A DAY in their servers lol


[14-Apr-20 04:08 AM] emma;#1525
And lately it‚Äôs been their events with other groups


[14-Apr-20 04:08 AM] xM_inn#2821
if they host it with other groups still announce


[14-Apr-20 04:08 AM] xM_inn#2821
as long as their partially involved in hosting their event


[14-Apr-20 04:09 AM] emma;#1525
Yeah I‚Äôm not announcing a 6 day event minn lol our people will get bored real quick, plus it‚Äôs not like they announced my event of the same category


[14-Apr-20 04:10 AM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôll announce actual events they host in game but I didn‚Äôt think their movie night or karaoke was imperative if it‚Äôs already being hosted by 3 groups


[14-Apr-20 04:10 AM] emma;#1525
They haven‚Äôt hosted an actual event besides the one I announced since February anyways


[14-Apr-20 04:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
what event did u host


[14-Apr-20 04:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; can u add a firing card for oceanliess please


[14-Apr-20 04:33 AM] xM_inn#2821
she'd like to know why she was fired


[14-Apr-20 04:57 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn I didn‚Äôt fire her...?


[14-Apr-20 04:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
wha


[14-Apr-20 04:59 AM] xM_inn#2821

[14-Apr-20 04:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
well do u know who did


[14-Apr-20 05:06 AM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôd assume trey


[14-Apr-20 05:06 AM] emma;#1525
I posted the pics I got but I was on mobile and busy with something else at the moment


[14-Apr-20 05:07 AM] emma;#1525
No one told me if she was fired or not


[14-Apr-20 05:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
oo ok


[14-Apr-20 05:23 AM] xM_inn#2821

[14-Apr-20 05:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
WHY R EXPLOITERS SHUTTING DOWN SERVERS THIS EARLY?


[14-Apr-20 05:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
someone just shutdown my training server


[14-Apr-20 06:19 AM] bman#0435
@xM_inn  idk how like sizzle stuff works like do they tell us to announce stuff like we do or do we jusr reannounce their event announcements


[14-Apr-20 06:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
reannounce their event announcements

theyre wasting their robux


[14-Apr-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder There is either exploiters majorly raiding interviews and crashing 3+ servers at once along with trainings as well, or ROBLOX is really stupid. Hotel is affected as well. If it's exploiters crashing servers, which it seems likely it is, no idea how they are doing it.


[14-Apr-20 04:22 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey Apparently a lot of groups are going through this, people think its bc of adopt me having 600k+ people on at once


[14-Apr-20 04:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809

im so disappointed ugh


[14-Apr-20 07:00 PM] bman#0435
hs told me he uses the crashing exploit to only test out his games


[14-Apr-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
And you believed him lol


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; host at a time when HS wouldnt be awake


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
I know


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
because he does...?


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How do you feel about him being blacklisted emma


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
Ill set a time but I‚Äôll actually have seniors slock 15 mins early


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
And we‚Äôll see what happens


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
i never said he didnt shut down ints/trainings


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
all i said was he used them for his games


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
do you want to test that at my 11 pm interviews? @emma;


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He legit admitted he crashed one of the sessions


[14-Apr-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
my server legit crashed the second excess was being kicked


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
but HOW


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he's done


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
@bman can i have your 9 pm trainings


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525

[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay let's not go that far


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
blacklist him


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
but we still need to know how hes doing it


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
cause he can easily do it again on alts


[14-Apr-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
does he deserve appeals


[14-Apr-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Apr-20 07:03 PM] bman#0435
welli would ask hs tbh


[14-Apr-20 07:03 PM] bman#0435
because i remmeber some people yesterday changed their discord name to hs_7


[14-Apr-20 07:03 PM] bman#0435
and i told them to stop because theyre basically impersonating hs


[14-Apr-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's him @bman


[14-Apr-20 07:03 PM] bman#0435

[14-Apr-20 07:05 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

roblox needs to reconfigure it so that a server checks slock BEFORE letting someone connect


[14-Apr-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
instead of the other way around


[14-Apr-20 07:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Apr-20 08:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
fraux has been coming to my sessions lately


[14-Apr-20 08:33 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Apr-20 08:33 PM] bman#0435

[14-Apr-20 08:34 PM] emma;#1525
fraux has been doing a lot lately


[14-Apr-20 08:34 PM] emma;#1525

[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So same as me


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
quwanterz wouldnt be my first selection


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
id go for fraux or candy tbh


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
fraux would be mine tbh


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
but fraux just got active after a year


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
I haven't got much of a choice since quw, imag, Anna, emi is the seniors I get at my sessions


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
we aren't gonna hit 1m for another month probably


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
but he def caught up to the other seniors


[14-Apr-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
true but i think his attitude would fit really well into the team


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
so we have time


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] bman#0435
imag anna and emily NEVER host for me


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think his maturity works really well


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] bman#0435
imag says theyre bad times for her, but she has time to attend them?

[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] Cam#5887
host for me either


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
imag barely hosts anymore


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont get many seniors


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Imag Anna and emi never miss a bonnies session well they do but u know what I mean


[14-Apr-20 08:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I only get anna madi


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
if i ask ryan to help with my prediction is that cheating


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
And quw attends regularly


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes emma


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
bonnie maybe its because they wanna suck up to u so they probs have u promote them


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
.


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
.


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
ok so i wont admit to it then


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
.


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since cyto isgonna make his own prediction


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe they wanted to slow down on hogging?


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
dunno


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
ever since i got shift, emily and annas activity went üìâ


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
And if its the same


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
oh so he'll probably lie to me


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
rude


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Kinda too slow


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
.


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think they wanted to slow down or something


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
who knows


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
ya i warned anna TWICE about hogging


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Oh cam u experienced it


[14-Apr-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
she ignored both


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Theres 3 others here that experienced the hogging


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] Cam#5887
i would be in a server first


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
emily and anna just give off pxrpley vibes


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Fun!


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] Cam#5887
then emily


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] Cam#5887
would come in


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
All we need is to buy a big advert board in adopt me and we will hit a million tomorrow


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525

Yes!


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye they are too quiet


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Except it would cost a lot of robux probably


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
i dont like people in cliques


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but behind the scenes, they probably plan some malicious things


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
at least


[14-Apr-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525

@xM_inn the card wasn't concluded and from what I heard you spent you rtime going around abusing gears or whatever and teleporting people so much they glitched

[14-Apr-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
probabyl my fault


[14-Apr-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
bc i kept glitching in


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
oops


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Forgot about the trello card my bad and yes I used gear like all my banning sessions as it's a private server


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
while the seniors are trying to be professional and ban...?


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Never glitched anyone tho


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ngl I've done the same


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's gonna ruin their pacing @xM_inn


[14-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
clearly you didn't finish bc i had to host a second banning session bc you had cards up from 3 days ago still


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
almost 300 of them


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
actually


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
I didnt have time to do 500 bans myself with 3 seniors


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
Why are you even using gears at banning sessions... the whole point is to ban


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
I had to go


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
If yall hosted more banning sessions I wouldn't have to step in


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then don't host it lol


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
Stacey hosted one the other day


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
You made Mack leave from being hit with gears.


[14-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
Mack usually clears the board by himself


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
And I'm not coming online to be lectured from yall about not using gears in a private server


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean minn


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you messed up their concentration


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
No because you can NEVER admit when you are wrong until one of us approaches you in soft, kind "omg of course you didn't mean it" words


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Bruhhh


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
If mack leaves then he leaves  if he doesnt like my banning sessions then he doesnt have to attend


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
plus the way you worded it out sounds like pure lazyness


[14-Apr-20 09:20 PM] Beartikal#9760

I've done it lots of times before as well and the seniors have had a laugh within their banning session as it's very dull

@bonnie591 That's really not professional or the message we want to be sending bonnie


[14-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
I let them abuse admin AFTER we finished


[14-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
and they had a lot of fun then


[14-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
but I didn't go around distracting them while they were trying to work


[14-Apr-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's gonna slow them tf down honestly


[14-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
doing something we don't REQUIRE them to do


[14-Apr-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

uhh


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
There's a difference between "Fun" and "unprofessional"


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's kind of concerning


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
ANd given the complaints I heard about today this seemed unprofessional


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
Theres also a difference between a public and private server


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
did you know that you can add an **infinite amount of numbers via a formula and get a a number not equal to infinity**


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bear


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal infinity is a theoretical number


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its 2 late for math rn


[14-Apr-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525
you'll never actually reach it with any formula

Making banning sessions boring is gonna make seniors leave


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] emma;#1525
Minn we've been hosting them for a year now


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] emma;#1525
And they still show up


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i went to emma or staceys banning session


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] emma;#1525
That's just not true


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] stacey#1000
I honestly don‚Äôt see why using gears during a banning session is professional. Minn, I‚Äôve hosted banning sessions with seniors and never used gears, they have never complained about it being boring, as they volunteer their time to join a banning session, they know what they are signing up for when they join the card. If seniors really found it boring, they would‚Äôve complained to us.


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they didnt leave


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
agreed @stacey


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they were worried about it being boring they wouldnt come


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
did u know that if u have a pie that u split with 3 friends and u cut it into 4 pieces and u keep cutting the remaining piece into 4 pieces there will always be a leftover and somebody will always argue for the last crumb


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] emma;#1525
Saying it's "boring" as a way to justify you being unprofessional and setting a bad guideline for how an HR treats his MRs is a new one but not one I'm accepting


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal you never gave us perms back


[14-Apr-20 09:23 PM] emma;#1525

[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] bman#0435
its not rly supposed to be abt it being boring its supposed to be abt getting the bans finished

but ty for accepting my fr


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
calculus lol


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
Yes, you can have fun on private servers but I don‚Äôt see why during a banning session is the time or place. When the banning session is done it would be better.


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
is that some sort of word problem


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
no its just a brain thinker i guess


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm gonna be honest


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal bear pls give us exiling perms


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve cleared 600 bans before with 3-4 seniors in the span of 30 minutes.


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think that would make my brain explode


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
baby can do that only


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525
AND TO ACCEPT MY FR


[14-Apr-20 09:24 PM] emma;#1525
i need to talk to him


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
what a noob


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
Can‚Äôt we at least take a real vote about using gears at banning sessions. @xM_inn


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
me and trey used to clear 2000 applications between the two of us


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i rather have that lol


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
it was boring af


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
See what everyone else thinks as well.


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
but we did it


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
and didnt complain lol


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] emma;#1525
bc that's a senior's job


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
did u know hotdogs have "skin"


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i find it kind of bothering of you pointing out that you couldn't clear 500 bans by yourself


[14-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i didnt know that


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
until jsuy now


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
sorry but that ain't it chief


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
Take your vote I'm not hosting banning sessions anymore if this is how strict were becoming


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
How is not abusing your MRs strict


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
We never used to be this strict and I honestly dont see what's changed


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
Bonnie used to do it when I was a senior and other HRs


[14-Apr-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
How is "host a banning session so you can DO BANS" not what you signed up for


[14-Apr-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
If y'all need to take a break that's one thing


[14-Apr-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
But abusing them with gears as they're actively working is NOT okay


[14-Apr-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
And that's what I heard was the major issue today


[14-Apr-20 09:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's just gonna kill their flow


[14-Apr-20 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
Not using gears during a ban sessions is not really strict. You can still have fun after the board is cleared.

If you want banning sessions to be fun then that's totally fine as long as you separate the fun from the seriousness


[14-Apr-20 09:28 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Apr-20 09:28 PM] emma;#1525

it looks like we can get 1550 robux max each week


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
1K for everything combined, so you could theoretically still earn 1K from doing only sessions


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525

[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ADMIN ACTS


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
BANS


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
it just makes it easier and more diverse activities to get robux


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
OMG


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg ya wut about bans


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
MACK U WILL FINALLY GET RECOGNIZED FOR ALWAYS CLEARING THE BOARDS!!


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe @bonnie591 can we switch "tickets" to "tickets OR bans"


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
not yet uh


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
so poor mack can get paid for being the only one to do them consistently


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
LOL


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
now its only tickets and apps


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
no cuz we dont even like bans


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Baby doesn't want to pay for negative things!!


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] bman#0435
12 sessions 25 tickets and 20 apps we can get 1550 robux? or just a max of 1k


[14-Apr-20 11:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Admin acts currently no because those vary, so like there may be nobody to ban, and I odnt want people banning just to mark that they banned LOL


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
1K Max bman


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
i mean there's usually 500 bans on the board


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] bman#0435
ok


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
but


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
ok


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal we love bans


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
max 1K, but each activity has a max of how much you can earn from that particular activity as well


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] bman#0435
i wasnt sure if it was just like per thing and not overall


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] bman#0435
kk


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe in future emma


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
so total MAX = 1K
Activity MAX varies


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
For now

[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
A second checklist or replacing the old one


[14-Apr-20 11:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah, I personally like this a lot and think it should help everyone a ton, huge improvement from the old system


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Not sure how the amounts will vary though, I may adjust it and what not


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the old one is going bye bye cookie


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
im glad we dont get paid for secondary servers anymore bc its hard to get EIGHT LIKE BONNIE DOES SOMETIMES


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Do we still check things off


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Or just log


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
bonnie is going to make a new checklist where you can like add +1 whenever you do an activity


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wut


[14-Apr-20 11:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[14-Apr-20 11:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma I haven't done 8 in a year


[14-Apr-20 11:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[14-Apr-20 11:11 PM] bonnie591#0591

I think mine is 4-5


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
starting now, those other servers dont count toward your marking, but still try and get them a senior host


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
@Cam how did your session go


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
did it work


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe oh btw did you give us exiling perms back


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
so only add +1 if you fully assist and rank a server entirely start to finish


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] bman#0435
i only get like 5-6 now. i used to get 3


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yes


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
im too lazy to check


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I did


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
TY!


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
Still continue with second severs this week and stuff


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
amazing we can exile that loser guy who was shutting down earlier


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] stacey#1000
so i dont add cards for second servers this week


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
WAIT BABY


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Does that mean


[14-Apr-20 11:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
We add a thing


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
20 times


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok so cookie


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
not sure how bonnie is gonna set it up, but I think it may just be editing text


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 do you want us to still add cards for second servers and just archive the ones that aren't main


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
+0 becomes +20 when u finish


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
so that everyone can still see what servers are being hosted


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
ya


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
OOOOOOOOOOO


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So we edit the text


[14-Apr-20 11:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
@emma; from next week u won't add second servers


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
The board won't look messy


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u want tho


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
:robux:


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
U can comment on ur card saying


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
its not about messy its about people knowing which servers are hosted


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
How many servers


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I‚Äôm gonna forget


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
To do that


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
i think we should still record secondary servers somewhere so people know


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bman#0435
wait so for cohosted is that where we put senior servers


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] stacey#1000
so admin acts arent a part of it


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
In card descriptionP


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
just keep it if you'd like, just make sure on your checklist you only count yourself


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
@bman no thats if you cohost


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
like with another HR


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
i think


[14-Apr-20 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll show u an example Emma tomorrow what we could do


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like take a secondaryserver from another hrs session?


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôm really excited about these new checklists


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
so training board checklist is just for management purposes now, while this new one determines pay


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] bman#0435
im just confusing myself atm so ill wait for when bonnie explains it


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
so make sure you mark what you did


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u take a second server from a hr session


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@bonnie591 CHECK YOUR EMOJI NOW


[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[14-Apr-20 11:15 PM] bonnie591#0591

you can‚Äôt even tell with the chips what I had to do


[15-Apr-20 01:42 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I legit had to take one picture of the full front of the bag, then I had to take another of the top at an angle, then used photoshop to stretch and transform the pic of the top over the layer of the just the front. Then did a little color touch up to make it look like it‚Äôs see less. It just looks like one bag.


[15-Apr-20 01:42 AM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming no idea lol the hotdog is fine i kinda like the sideways condiments

Kenzi was laughing at it and encouraging people to make more photos.


[15-Apr-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-Apr-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
My question is how did people find out why he was banned


[15-Apr-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
And crashing servers


[15-Apr-20 01:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
idk about banning him


[15-Apr-20 01:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
didn't do as much


[15-Apr-20 01:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was just as bad @RAMMGaming


[15-Apr-20 01:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Up to you but if you feel that I'm not against it


[15-Apr-20 01:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[15-Apr-20 01:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-Apr-20 01:19 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

you can just not send him the evidence


[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i was planing on just telling him that he was banned for crashing servers


[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if he doesn't ask, there's no point


[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
thats my point


[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok


[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

ill show him it


[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-Apr-20 01:22 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok


[15-Apr-20 01:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-Apr-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He had no business to crashing our games in the first place


[15-Apr-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What the fuck is wrong with him


[15-Apr-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Out of all the games he could've tested


[15-Apr-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This shouldn't have been an option


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
trey it wasnt just us lmfao


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
ur overreacting tbh


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
it was sb, frappe,fizze


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
a lot of other groups


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman how am I even overreacting


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
boba


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
idk how i should respond


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He legit admitted he crashed a session "weeks ago"


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
ur just assuming he targeted only our game but he just targeted groups overall


[15-Apr-20 01:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@emma; train me to be a good investigator im lacking it clearly ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è


[15-Apr-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman even if he targeted other games, it shouldn't have been ours in the first place


[15-Apr-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He still technically exploited at one of our sessions


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
should i just say


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Exploiting = ban


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
?


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Pretty much


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but if it isnt hs shutting down the servers now then


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think he was helping us by ruining a session that trainees or interviewees planned on attending


[15-Apr-20 01:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
we need to find out who


[15-Apr-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He still admitted to shutting down the servers


[15-Apr-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So yeah


[15-Apr-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thanks but no thanks to HS


[15-Apr-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Quite honestly, this isn't even helping us one bit


[15-Apr-20 01:44 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
he said he didnt crash servers last night


[15-Apr-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True but he still admitted to crashing the servers weeks ago


[15-Apr-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
To me, what he did was a bush league move


[15-Apr-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't like how he didn't come forward with this either, so basically he's been hiding this for a good amount of time


[15-Apr-20 01:48 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
omg


[15-Apr-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@xAfroTrey he honestly dropped the conversation so i think hes handling it well? the only thing that may sound concerning is that he called nikki a bitch but said it was because of other reasons like taking his role in a server and ignoring him, but not sure. but since hes already blacklisted i think we did good, thanks for cropping the pics c:

i was at her interview server for like 5 minutes and she wasnt answering right, and i just left cause i had to go start my server and AS SOON as i left she said "im back" i was like girl.............


[15-Apr-20 02:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
AGREED.
Especially with the entire situation that went down earlier, she was participating in it rather than stopping it.


[15-Apr-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
@katie the ‚ÄúAsad‚Äù thing with emojis is something a bunch of MRs were doing so we can‚Äôt hold tjag just against kenzi


[15-Apr-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
was this all bc HS got banned yesterday


[15-Apr-20 02:36 PM] katie#0200
the person who reported said they noticed it over the past few weeks


[15-Apr-20 02:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Everyone was


[15-Apr-20 02:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[15-Apr-20 02:37 PM] katie#0200
i believe trey mentioned he was going to talk to kenzi but idk what thats done especially since its more than just one incident

[15-Apr-20 02:40 PM] katie#0200

[15-Apr-20 02:41 PM] katie#0200
i think something was deleted because it looks different when i searched it up but i didnt really find anything significant

[15-Apr-20 02:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
‚ÄúCan u do harry styles ‚Äú


[15-Apr-20 02:42 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I guess


[15-Apr-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
I brought this up about kenzi earlier


[15-Apr-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
about how she was involved in the whole situation with people sending photos etc


[15-Apr-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
and was encouraging it


[15-Apr-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
we decided on warning her at least


[15-Apr-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
i mean also may possible suspsension


[15-Apr-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Apr-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
...


[15-Apr-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
Makes it sound like she did it on purpose


[15-Apr-20 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I think we should make an announcement about it, it's been happening a lot recently


[15-Apr-20 05:39 PM] Polk#1596
What anime is that? I thought that was ken kaneki @Tattoblue


[15-Apr-20 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
no its killua from hunter x hunter @Polk


[15-Apr-20 05:40 PM] Polk#1596
Yes it's not that difficult to refrain from writing "all"


[15-Apr-20 05:40 PM] Polk#1596
An announcement would be nice so we can stop having these almost daily pings about "This MR kicked all, don't fire them plz"


[15-Apr-20 05:41 PM] Polk#1596
I get that its a mistake but if it happens repeatedly its different


[15-Apr-20 05:41 PM] Polk#1596
Oh i dont know what that is D:


[15-Apr-20 05:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
you should watch it


[15-Apr-20 05:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
hehe


[15-Apr-20 05:46 PM] katie#0200
yes they should at least write more than three characters of someones username when using commands


[15-Apr-20 05:46 PM] bman#0435
storys been saying that for months now lol


[15-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yikes again


[15-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôll make an announcement about it to MRs


[15-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It‚Äôs been happening too much


[15-Apr-20 05:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Should we start handing out consequences if it happens more than twice?


[15-Apr-20 05:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Because I did that ONCE in my entire career and it was my first day


[15-Apr-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
ive never done it :D


[15-Apr-20 05:58 PM] ethan;#0003
Can we stop tagging for kicking all


[15-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ive only done it like once or twice in my entire career


[15-Apr-20 05:58 PM] ethan;#0003
It happenes so much


[15-Apr-20 06:05 PM] Polk#1596
I've done it 0 times


[15-Apr-20 06:06 PM] Polk#1596
You just have to ensure you write more than THREE letters everytime you kick someone (preferably more than that) and check what you write before you press enter


[15-Apr-20 06:07 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah I mean we never actually do something about the people that kick all on accident so there's no point


[15-Apr-20 06:07 PM] Polk#1596
Maybe a rule saying that kicking all whether it is an accident or not will motivate the MRs to be more careful


[15-Apr-20 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
It wouldn't be very strict if it is so easy to avoid


[15-Apr-20 06:09 PM] Polk#1596
I meant a rule saying that kicking all whether it is an accident or not will result in a written warning may motivate*


[15-Apr-20 06:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@bman when was the last time she kicked all


[15-Apr-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435

I think just HR


[15-Apr-20 07:12 PM] Cam#5887
ok so no more second server cards


[15-Apr-20 07:12 PM] Cam#5887
though @bonnie591 are we allowed to put who is hosting each server in our cards on the training board?


[15-Apr-20 07:12 PM] bman#0435
im more confused now lol


[15-Apr-20 07:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wait is co-hosting like hosting another hrs server if they have no one to host? @bonnie591


[15-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
or actually going to cohost with an hr


[15-Apr-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
he said yesterday that it was when u hosted with another hr but like that never happens

I know that the management board has been leaked in the past, however it seems that an interviewee leaked the management board and talked about how they have pictures of both the management and senior management board and claimed to be Madi. I find it odd how we've been having many issues recently of Madi leaking stuff.

[15-Apr-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the fact that they have the balls to say this in public but can't even message us because i'm pretty sure they'll protect her


[15-Apr-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but we'll see how this goes

[15-Apr-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
y'all REALLY think madi would be dumb enough to go to an interview and leak mb and sb information in front of MRs üòÇ


[15-Apr-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
after all these instances of MRs being framed in very similar ways


[15-Apr-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
ik y'all are unhappy with madi right now but we're not just automatically going to be like "well we got two reports so thats pretty solid"


[15-Apr-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
fun fact, the one friend that teardrops person is friends with... is following ava_ix


[15-Apr-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
i'd start there personally lol


[15-Apr-20 07:44 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
im not saying she said that stuff at ints


[15-Apr-20 07:45 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
im just saying weve gotten two reports, its better to prove them false with actually investigating then to just prove them false because it seems "unlikely "


[15-Apr-20 07:45 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i mean i think it might be fake but u never know


[15-Apr-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
ya and im not saying dont look into it bc obiously someone is leaking


[15-Apr-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
but it doesnt make sense to start with madi at all


[15-Apr-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
especially when ava has a connection to this teardrops person lol


[15-Apr-20 07:45 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
bruh


[15-Apr-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
regardless if ava was friends or connected with them or not, its still suspicious that madi had been accused of leaking literally twice in under a week. the least we can really do is investigate, just to ensure she truly isnt leaking


[15-Apr-20 07:48 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
why is ava always connected üò©


[15-Apr-20 07:48 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Doubt it‚Äôs a current MR, might be one of the formers


[15-Apr-20 07:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Do we know anyone who has beef with Madi atm?


[15-Apr-20 07:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And should we message Madi as to who might hav beef with her?

Our MRs are genuinely confused on what is major enough to ban them. We should update this as any inappropriate behaviour should be a ban, but it also depends on the situation.


[16-Apr-20 02:34 AM] Cam#5887
i agree that inappropriate behavior should be a ban


[16-Apr-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
Right now they‚Äôve been giving 3 warnings but it should be a ban.


[16-Apr-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000

What does this mean


[16-Apr-20 12:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
If Bonnie says who wants a second server and you host it counts so you can log it as a training


[16-Apr-20 12:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
You just don‚Äôt log any of the seniors sessions

@xAfroTrey yikes, she‚Äôs a manager so she should be helping new MRs instead of trashing them behind their back

[16-Apr-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525
Not the behavior I want from a manager


[16-Apr-20 01:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I feel like she needs a suspension ngl


[16-Apr-20 01:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's basically trash talking, leaking my DMs, and wasn't genuine about her apology

[16-Apr-20 01:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
A termination at this point would be a bit much unless something substantial was said

[16-Apr-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
june won the voting didn't she


[16-Apr-20 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
Only thing about Kiki is she was inactive for a really long time


[16-Apr-20 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
And just came back not too too long ago.


[16-Apr-20 01:52 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye she has shown dedication but when everyone is able to go out again she might change to be inactive again


[16-Apr-20 01:52 PM] stacey#1000
Gotta keep that in mind. Don‚Äôt want her going inactive again for a really long time


[16-Apr-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs been a manager for a longer time. Most of that time she was inactive so


[16-Apr-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i feel like it's the same story for fraux rn


[16-Apr-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah he was inactive for awhile too


[16-Apr-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs same thing as if another shift vote came up I wouldn‚Äôt vote him right away cause he just came back recently


[16-Apr-20 01:56 PM] emma;#1525
Kiki has been active for months now


[16-Apr-20 01:57 PM] emma;#1525
Idk if that argument is super valid


[16-Apr-20 01:57 PM] emma;#1525
I mean she came back in I think January??


[16-Apr-20 01:57 PM] emma;#1525
That‚Äôs 4 months


[16-Apr-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying still have to consider her inactivity. Don‚Äôt want her going inactive again for a long time


[16-Apr-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True true @stacey


[16-Apr-20 02:32 PM] stacey#1000

[16-Apr-20 05:39 PM] Cam#5887
its like she doesnt even care


[16-Apr-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
shes still giving an attitude response


[16-Apr-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
if this continues she will be terminated


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im just gonna leave it for now


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yikes


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
shes never gonna get senior


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's in for a long road if she really wants it


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] Cam#5887
my god


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] Cam#5887
smh


[16-Apr-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
like why all this attitude


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i have no idea


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] Cam#5887
if she thinks that her being an ass to someone is going to get her senior, boy shes in for a treat


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
shes probably talking about this with others and complaining


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wouldn't be surprised


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
sorry ill be against her forever getting senior


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if she gets to that point


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] bman#0435
i swear she was suspended befroe


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we have two choices


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] Cam#5887
just from seeing that


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
a) extend it


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
b) terminate her


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
i dont think she was suspended before


[16-Apr-20 05:41 PM] Cam#5887
if we ever run her for senior, shes out from me as well


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
she was warned yesterday


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is her first


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
so we cant terminate


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kind of disappointing to see her replicate the same behavior


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] bman#0435
her and vac ruined their chances at senior lol


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
unless she continues


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] Cam#5887
lmao


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] Cam#5887
it just doesnt seem like she doesnt care


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@bman who's ur picks at senior in your opinion


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
we can extend her suspension to 5 days instead of 3


[16-Apr-20 05:42 PM] bman#0435
kiki or fvarrr


[16-Apr-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
I like iidrxzzle for an option


[16-Apr-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
both dedicated, fairly active


[16-Apr-20 05:43 PM] Cam#5887
kiki i agree


[16-Apr-20 05:43 PM] Cam#5887
tbh


[16-Apr-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
probably kiki tho


[16-Apr-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
still concerned about her inactivity she had but shes active now


[16-Apr-20 05:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we'll see in the next senior vote


[16-Apr-20 05:44 PM] Cam#5887

[16-Apr-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887
and if u dont want them seeing the chat at all, turn off read messages


[16-Apr-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887
she's probably


[16-Apr-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887
hella pissed


[16-Apr-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887
the people like that scare me


[16-Apr-20 06:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[16-Apr-20 06:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
but her acting like this


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
is extremely


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
unnecessary


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
it's weird


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
and not mature one bit


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
like


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
super weird


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like she never did this before


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
legit


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
i swear she is with the cbs


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Tattoblue#5828
as an MR too.. oof


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
all she had to say when trey sent the message was


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
"Okay, I apologize for what I've done."


[16-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cam#5887
then leave it at that


[16-Apr-20 06:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she didn't need to take omar's advice


[16-Apr-20 06:34 PM] Cam#5887
not "alrighttttttttttttttt"

[16-Apr-20 06:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[16-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Polk#1596

[16-Apr-20 06:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
POLK IS THAT NOT WHAT SHE MEANT


[16-Apr-20 06:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
can she like stop making it worse upon herself lol


[16-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
Well I think she was demanding to talk because she "paid" us


[16-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
But rules are rules


[16-Apr-20 06:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she can talk in like 3 days


[16-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
Exactly


[16-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
She will be fine


[16-Apr-20 06:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like the fact that she makes this seem like it's permanent


[16-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she can talk to her friends but like


[16-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not in the bloxton platform right now


[16-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's all


[16-Apr-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like it's that simple


[16-Apr-20 06:52 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
YEAH LIKE FR


[16-Apr-20 06:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

you'll have more freedom than our server


[16-Apr-20 06:54 PM] Polk#1596
Kenzi is becoming more annoying and stupid by the time goes by


[16-Apr-20 06:55 PM] Polk#1596
It's sad how she has changed from when I promoted her to head


[16-Apr-20 06:56 PM] Polk#1596
After the awards idk if u guys saw but she was all like "OK YALL DONT NEED 5 MILLION SENTENCES, JUST SAY THANKS JESUS CHRIST" like it was so obvious she was salty she didn't win


[16-Apr-20 06:56 PM] Polk#1596

[16-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
I told him he wasn't giving me much to work with and he wrote 2 more sentences


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
their tone and pacing of the appeal is really bad too


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
LOL


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like how much they beg


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like it's so in your face and makes me uncomfortable @Polk


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
Hmm yeah


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
I agree


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
I can tell he is young though


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
Well I know he is


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah but like


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's gotta learn how to make a genuine apology


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
Because after my announcement about ages he DMed me and said "I'm turning 13 on 17th of april. Will I get banned?" like ü§¶


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and this ain't it


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Polk#1596

True


[17-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Cam#5887
yeah i dont see her much, but that could be cause of timezones


[17-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Cam#5887
much at the hotel*


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Cam#5887
i should add, cause shes very active at training and ints


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But man I'm really liking how she's reporting MRs and holding them accountable


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Cam#5887
i agree


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Cam#5887
it shows good management/leadership skills


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If she keeps doing that and other steps, she could be really good


[17-Apr-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
She just got management right


[17-Apr-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
I mean bts did


[17-Apr-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm but I'm really impressed of how she's handling situations


[17-Apr-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
Same


[17-Apr-20 01:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Her and moody are usually the ones to report tho


[17-Apr-20 01:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I really like that


[17-Apr-20 01:37 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey is bia a Manager?


[17-Apr-20 01:38 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Apr-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
anyone else notice how simplegeomatry follows you on hotel servers


[17-Apr-20 02:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm no


[17-Apr-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
cause legit I server hopped maybe 5 times and he followed me every time


[17-Apr-20 02:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's not a great sign


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
like I left to test him


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
and when I left he would've been the only MR there


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
then he still followed me and left another server unmoderated


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's up on the promotion opinions card rn


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
no he follows people


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you can comment that


[17-Apr-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
like legit i just tested him


[17-Apr-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
Omg he‚Äôs annoying


[17-Apr-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
Always tagging for dumb stuff


[17-Apr-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
OF COURSE HE FOLLOWED ME INTO THIS SERVER AGAIN


[17-Apr-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
AND THEN LEFT 2 SECONDS LATER


[17-Apr-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn Are you still planning on redoing allied reps? Or is that not going to happen while you‚Äôre on notice


[17-Apr-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
im not ally rep for any group


[17-Apr-20 02:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm repping for boba


[17-Apr-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
whoever‚Äôs sizzleburgers isn‚Äôt doing their job


[17-Apr-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
Sizzle just announced an event yesterday and no ones put it up for our ally announcements


[17-Apr-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
And minn said we should be putting all events up


[17-Apr-20 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
whos SB rep


[17-Apr-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i believe it's bman


[17-Apr-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
I thought minn was one but ig not if he‚Äôs not announcing it


[17-Apr-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't mind announcing it now


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll look at what they announced


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
I remember when Minn asked for ally rep and I asked for when then never heard a response


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
did they ask for it to be announced tho


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
I always want to apply but he does first come first server


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
And so the same few people get it


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
Arent you ally rep for a group emma


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
So I‚Äôm only a rep at glazin


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
and minn says we‚Äôre supposed to announce events even if they don‚Äôt specifically ask us to


[17-Apr-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Apparently


[17-Apr-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's on april 18th so we have plenty of time


[17-Apr-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[17-Apr-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah but trey if we don‚Äôt do it now it‚Äôs not gonna happen


[17-Apr-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
You know how bad we are at actually doing things


[17-Apr-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525

[17-Apr-20 02:21 PM] bman#0435

[17-Apr-20 02:21 PM] stacey#1000

who are these people


[17-Apr-20 04:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Both LRs.


[17-Apr-20 04:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Started in our server, spilled into DMs


[17-Apr-20 04:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like JustBacon is overreacting a TON


[17-Apr-20 04:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well like


[17-Apr-20 04:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That's a lot of hurtful stuff in there


[17-Apr-20 04:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if one or both parties don't fix it soon, consequences are definitely going to be placed into the table


[17-Apr-20 04:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[17-Apr-20 04:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
To write THAT big of a paragraph.


[17-Apr-20 04:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

There‚Äôs a lot more than just that


[17-Apr-20 04:43 PM] emma;#1525
They can block each other if they don‚Äôt want to talk to each other


[17-Apr-20 04:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That's pretty bad


[17-Apr-20 04:44 PM] emma;#1525
But I‚Äôm not playing therapist to overreacting 10 year olds


[17-Apr-20 04:44 PM] emma;#1525
If you wanna punish them even tho this isn‚Äôt Bloxton related at all, just be aware of the precedent you‚Äôre setting


[17-Apr-20 04:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That's the reason I gave him


[17-Apr-20 04:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Then he kept going on and on


[17-Apr-20 04:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'm giving a strict warning


[17-Apr-20 04:45 PM] emma;#1525
Okay


[17-Apr-20 04:45 PM] emma;#1525
Tell them to block each other


[17-Apr-20 04:52 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye


[17-Apr-20 04:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can't believe the person who was sent that wants to stay friends after that stuff was said


[17-Apr-20 04:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I would've blocked on the spot

[17-Apr-20 09:26 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[17-Apr-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
well he made it seem like announcing alliance stuff was a huge deal


[17-Apr-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
but if it's something that can wait for him to come off a notice of however long then clearly not lol bc no one's been doing it so


[17-Apr-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well alrighty then lol

empire has the biggest shot but it isn't much of a shot


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
wasn't very impressed when I went before


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
I've never seen empire put on an actual show


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
bc it takes them 6 hours to figure out what they're even doign


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
and their LRs get mod and btools to host


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525
which usually doesnt end well


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye


[18-Apr-20 03:39 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 03:47 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

BMan........ empire *gets a flood of memories....* LMAAOAOAOAOAO @bman


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
ok, i think we just need to make it so everyone has a fair chance of being a rep


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
bc the same 3 people are reps like 4 times


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
like u


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
mr ramm


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
a rep for 3 groups


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
smh


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
minn is a rep for 4


[18-Apr-20 03:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
can me and Emma be reps at same group I wanna be Emma‚Äôs parent


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
partner*


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
...


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
im a rep at glazin


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
stay away


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
...


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
anyways üôÑ


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
bloo you arent a rep anywhere


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no so next time there‚Äôs an opening I CALL for it


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
well we're redoing them


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] bman#0435
@Bloo_Berriez LOL THATS WHAT I MEAN


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
so hopefully everyone will have the chance to rep at least one place


[18-Apr-20 03:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok so I can drop boba.


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Actually


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
i think what we should do is just limit it to max 2 reps per group


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
so basically you would give up one, minn would give up 2


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
and then the new HRs can each take one of the spots


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
bc bman, cam, and story have 0


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
idk if story wants one


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
stacey has 0


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
and i think she wants one


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Honestly for the time being min should give up some more, as he is on notice


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
oh wait bman does have one


[18-Apr-20 03:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
we can give him back some when he comes back


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] emma;#1525
well they have limits


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] emma;#1525
i think that if other HRs want spots then we should be keeping it more even


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] emma;#1525
if cam stacey and story dont want spots then minn can keep 4 but im pretty sure at least stacey has said she wouldn't mind being a rep


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] emma;#1525
and she's a GM lol so its kinda weird she hasn't been given one


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'll ask Min!


[18-Apr-20 03:55 PM] emma;#1525
okie


[18-Apr-20 03:56 PM] bman#0435
ya same thing with rmaam!!!!! hes a rep at 3


[18-Apr-20 03:56 PM] emma;#1525
@Cam do you want to be an allied rep somewhere


[18-Apr-20 03:56 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 03:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[18-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming ok so bliss, stacey, story, bloo, bonnie, cam, and mack all rep 0 groups


[18-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
i doubt bonnie wants one, same with bliss and story but we can still ask


[18-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez do you actually want to rep somewhere


[18-Apr-20 03:57 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[18-Apr-20 03:57 PM] bman#0435
its so easy to get in


[18-Apr-20 03:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[18-Apr-20 03:58 PM] emma;#1525
there's so many on


[18-Apr-20 03:58 PM] bman#0435
seniors never ask to host anymore


[18-Apr-20 03:58 PM] emma;#1525
@Cam i'll harass them for you


[18-Apr-20 03:58 PM] bman#0435
they have us beg them


[18-Apr-20 03:58 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[18-Apr-20 03:58 PM] emma;#1525
sometimes you gotta tag them individually


[18-Apr-20 03:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'd prefer someone who hasn't been an allied rep for right now, we don't have enough for everyone right this second but will make it work.


[18-Apr-20 03:59 PM] bman#0435
i tag all seniors

[18-Apr-20 04:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bloo was already a rep for someone


[18-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
bloo said he'd take one if there was an open spot, cam said he wants one


[18-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] katie#0200
Oh


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying he doesn‚Äôt need that many


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
he's on inactive notice


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
he needs 0


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
but he can keep like

[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying like you shouldn‚Äôt need that many


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Allow others a chance to be a rep


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] katie#0200
Yeah idk what‚Äôs going on with breezys since i can‚Äôt get in their server


[18-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
i say give someone  his boba spot bc they're an active group so it's good practice


[18-Apr-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
glazin doesnt announce many events so thats an easy one if someone wants to take that spot too


[18-Apr-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
and im there so you can party with meeee


[18-Apr-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I can leave SB since there‚Äôs 4 now and go to Boba instead


[18-Apr-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Apr-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525

tsunami used to be a really active group


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'd like to keep Boba as my one but I'm willing to give up Koala


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
but i feel like they just died out


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming you can keep both, give minn's spot to someone


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
we all agree he doesn't need 5 at all, let alone on inactivity


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can't he wants all 4


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
too bad


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He's a senior over me


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
2 gm votes = 1 bod vote


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
we have 3 gm votes


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
so thats 1.5 BOD votes


[18-Apr-20 04:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
take it up over bonnie


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
and he put you in charge of it


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
so


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] bman#0435
bruh what


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] bman#0435
how does min get to keep 4


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] bman#0435
itd be most fair for everyone to get 1


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
breezy's just got back up


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He didn't put me in charge of reorganizing allied roles


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Only ally requests


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] bman#0435
and maybe the bigger groups have a limit of 4 reps


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] bman#0435
like sb


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think it's fair of minn to keep FIVE spots when he went on inactivity notice without giving us any information as to why or when he'll be back, didn't give his jobs to anyone else until it became a live issue


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt get why he needs to be rep for 4+ groups


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'm only giving up what I have for everyone else because I don't need three


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
and literally is trying to control things when HE DOESNT WANT TO BE ACTIVE


[18-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn Be the mature one and give some of your allied rep spots away you dont need 5 and we all agree on that thank you


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
and tell us what your plan is with this stupid inactivity notice bc no one has any idea


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
thank you


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
I think it‚Äôs fair everyone should get at least one ally spot if they want to be rep for at least 1 group.


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
minn is an HR at 3 groups he doesn't have time to be an allied rep at 5 as well


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bloo is gonna get my Koala since he says he's never been an allied rep and he is the longest HR here he gets senior rule


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly.


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
Bloo technically has seniority over minn so let's just get bloo to agree to it


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez Hello


[18-Apr-20 04:35 PM] emma;#1525
if that makes you feel better ramm


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
I thought two GM votes= BOD.


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it does lol


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WHO SAID THAT LOL


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
it is until a BOD disagrees with us


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
And Emma and I both agree so.


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
MINN AND BONNIE AND BLOO ALL AGREED


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
at the HR meeting


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
Sooooo


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah.


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
Me and stacey = a BOD


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
welp


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
and me and stacey say take 2 of Minn's allied reps away


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
There is your BOD decision


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
well I say take all of them away but


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
he can keep like


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
2


[18-Apr-20 04:36 PM] emma;#1525
ig


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Well im not going to just take them right out from him when he said he wants to keep them


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
I'll do it


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
what about every hr gets 1 rep spot and the bigger groups like boba/sb can have 4 reps unless we can only have 3


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
I took the investigations team away bc he isn't in a place to handle it


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We can have a discussion with him first as to why he wants to keep them all


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I don‚Äôt agree with getting rid of all but I def don‚Äôt agree he needs 4+.


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
We have to do whats best for the team


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe like 2-3


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
and an inactive HR repping us at 5 groups isn't good for the team


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Let's talk to him first before doing it


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
please


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
please never do that ever again @RAMMGaming


[18-Apr-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
So go talk to him and let him know that everyone wants him to give up some spots


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
he can pick TWO to keep


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] bman#0435
can yall take my idea into consideration? üò≠


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
and we want to give other HRs the chance to have rep spots


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think i just died on the inside


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
and then let us know


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525

üòÉ


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wym @bman


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] bman#0435
"what about every hr gets 1 rep spot and the bigger groups like boba/sb can have 4 reps unless we can only have 3"


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
@bman we dont pick how many spots we get


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
the groups set that


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
so like sizzle has a max of 3


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
and we technically have 4 but we're ignoring it until they point it out


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
(but we have 4)


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] bman#0435
o i thought we did since we have 3 for all except breezys


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
we can't just have 4  for other groups bc we want to


[18-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
no breezy's prob only set a max of 2


[18-Apr-20 04:39 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming ok go talk to minn and report back

I don't need rank or something to justify myself as a great person, but my personality. Everyone is unique as they are & as special as they are. Nobody can judge you by your looks or on what you do. In the end, your personality matters more than anything else.

DECLINE OF FRIENDSHIP

Hello, @Cam !

As sad as it may seem, but I am announcing that our friendship has officially come to a close as of 5:49 PM. I don't think that us both make a good pair nor do we get along with each other. As a result, your office has been officially removed as well from the office. I am discontinuing this friendship not because I hate you, but due to the fact that we do not get along and that is the main purpose. Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

So basically he's redoing the allied reps right, well minn currently is a rep at 5 places and we all think that's too many so we need you to approve changing some of minn's around so he has less and other HRs who aren't a rep can have a change


[18-Apr-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
and minn doesnt want to give any up ;(( so yeah we need ur approval bc you have seniority says ramm

If Emma gets bod I'd be honor member first


[18-Apr-20 05:40 PM] emma;#1525
if i get bod i'm gonna seriously question the credibility of this whole HR team's decision making

@bonnie591 CAN I RECOMMEND that we remove you from BOD, promote stort instead, and then promote Bloo to head of suspended, polk can be the new HHADMINISTATION bot


[18-Apr-20 05:41 PM] emma;#1525
and just fire everyone else


[18-Apr-20 05:41 PM] emma;#1525

Actually if Emma gets bod


[18-Apr-20 05:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
She will more likely do something that will get her fired


[18-Apr-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 05:44 PM] emma;#1525
bloo no offense but you would probably be the one BOD to keep me sane


[18-Apr-20 05:44 PM] emma;#1525
you aren't allowed to resign


[18-Apr-20 05:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
If I get promoted to honor member then I loose the right to break the bloxton discord rules


[18-Apr-20 05:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg thanks Emma


[18-Apr-20 05:44 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Apr-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
Can we talk about possibly getting new seniors or like increasing the limit on seniors cause legit we‚Äôve been getting too many servers lately. Like a lot more. 7-8 servers, 4-5 for late est times. It‚Äôs a lot. The group has increased in members a lot so I think we need to raise the senior limit to like 22 and get 2-3 new seniors. The ones we have not all are active and not all are available at times. It‚Äôs always us having to ask them to host when maybe that one senior had already hosted a lot in a day and needed a break for the rest of the day


[18-Apr-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
There‚Äôs my argument for new seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
arent we on


[18-Apr-20 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
18 seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
we can hire 2 more


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
19


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
But I‚Äôm saying we need to increase senior limit a bit


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
More group members, higher activity we need more


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
ill bring it up with baby


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
poss increase to 25


[18-Apr-20 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
We can‚Äôt keep up with the amount of set servers we get when some seniors we have aren‚Äôt even fully active


[18-Apr-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not like seniors get paid so I don‚Äôt see the harm increasing it either


[18-Apr-20 06:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Who's ur candidates so far Stacey


[18-Apr-20 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôm looking at Kiki and iidrxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
And possibly emm_yyx


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hmm


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
Or even like


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emm I think needs a bit more time


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But kiki and drxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
She was promoted in October


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait really


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
Same with drxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's been that long


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Woah


[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Apr-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
Noob


[18-Apr-20 06:11 PM] stacey#1000
She was promoted around same time as drxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
O wow


[18-Apr-20 06:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok then


[18-Apr-20 06:11 PM] stacey#1000
Let me look at candidates for a sec


[18-Apr-20 06:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also I just realized that all of them are females


[18-Apr-20 06:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma would be so proud


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How about kenzi @stacey


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
We gotta look at time zones too


[18-Apr-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
Trip is not a bad candidate but like idk if she goes to hotel


[18-Apr-20 06:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She does


[18-Apr-20 06:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I see her quite often too


[18-Apr-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
Or fvarr


[18-Apr-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
So I see 5 people


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
UsuallyTrippieh, Kiki, fvarr, emm_yyx, iidrxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
Only one of them is EST


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
Kiki


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If we pick two


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'd like to see Kiki and Trip


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
I would say Kiki and iidrxzzle or trip


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I‚Äôd like to see trey


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
Me too


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I think he‚Äôs a good fit


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Both of them have really clean records, get along with others very well, etc


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh and pretty mature too


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
Let‚Äôs demote trey to rank 12 and replace him with estrellic


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Wasn‚Äôt someone saying Kiki was inactive for a while?


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
I was


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Obviously not anymore though.


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was Stacey


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
Because still have to consider how long she was inactive


[18-Apr-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
we need more seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I see what she means though


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
my trainings just now


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
i had to beg


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
for people to host


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
nobody asked


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Yes that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm arguing for it Ethan


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
5 servers


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But how much do we need


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
We need the senior limit increased


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
the past week ive had to beg


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Badly


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Same


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause I want at least 3 or 4


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
I had 8 servers earlier


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
only one that asks to host is cory


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
everyone else I need to ask them


[18-Apr-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
And one didn‚Äôt get hosted


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
most of my trainings a server doesnt get hosted


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
because nobody wants to hsot


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
host


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
We need like 2-3 new seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
KIKI


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
PLEASE


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
KIKI


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
I think one of the main reasons is because the seniors we have that host might be hosting a lot in a day and want a break


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] ethan;#0003
#KIKIFORSENIOR


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
Yes Kiki and iidrxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Kiki, Trip, and Drxzzle are my picks


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs one est and bst senior


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If I recall correctly, none of them have been through drama


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh I never really see trip, I mean at least he doesn‚Äôt attend my sessions


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] ethan;#0003
my picks are Kiki, Trip, Moody


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Omg moody


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
Trip is in BST bloo


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
That might be why


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
I agree with moody too


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't think about him


[18-Apr-20 06:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don‚Äôt host that late Stacey


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] ethan;#0003
but WE NEED KIKI


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I agree


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] ethan;#0003
KIKI HAS BEEN HERE SO LONG


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] stacey#1000
But trip is not my first pick so


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Moody actually does really well


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] ethan;#0003
she almost got senior instead of stacey


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] stacey#1000
My first 2 picks are Kiki and iidrxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I tend to host from 12-2pm pst my time which is only like 10 pm for BST at the latest


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] stacey#1000
Then my next two would be moody and trip


[18-Apr-20 06:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I feel like I'm dealing with a different person when I think about Moody


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes Kiki I agree with and drizzle


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When moody first came here, he was uh questionable


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nowadays I'm liking him


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's one of the people that holds people accountable too


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[18-Apr-20 06:20 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs not had any problems since he‚Äôs been back


[18-Apr-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like he's quite consistent with MR reporting which I like


[18-Apr-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs like the only former I respect for changing and coming back


[18-Apr-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think someone else was like that


[18-Apr-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
Because other formers that have come back there has been issues with


[18-Apr-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
Like Saab


[18-Apr-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
And slee


[18-Apr-20 06:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Kyle is one of those formers that never really changed


[18-Apr-20 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
But not every former


[18-Apr-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
i respect moody, and trip they are good formers


[18-Apr-20 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
So first 2 is Kiki and iidrxzzle


[18-Apr-20 06:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Probably the best comeback I've seen this year was Tate


[18-Apr-20 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
Then moody and trip


[18-Apr-20 06:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like there's a lot to like about those people


[18-Apr-20 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
Step 1. Increase senior limit


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
Or fire inactive seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
.


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
.


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
.


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is there any


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
Bearvish and Darren


[18-Apr-20 06:24 PM] stacey#1000
Don‚Äôt do anything


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
They never host


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Everyone else is pretty active


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
They are on notice but been inactive for awhile


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
Megan is not the most active either


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Darren is planning on going soon


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
But at least she‚Äôs not completely inactive


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
Like Darren and bearvish


[18-Apr-20 06:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't like how much attention he brings to him resigning


[18-Apr-20 06:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think Jack did the same thing he did


[18-Apr-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
If Darren is going to resign and he‚Äôs not hosting or doing anything for his last months before he resigns why is he a senior


[18-Apr-20 06:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I would just do it now if I'm not doing activities


[18-Apr-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs legit just holding up a spot for someone else that‚Äôs active and we need people that would be active


[18-Apr-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
What‚Äôs the point in waiting until July if he‚Äôs not doing anything now


[18-Apr-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs annoying


[18-Apr-20 06:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and the thing with bear is I always see him playing games


[18-Apr-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
BRUH HIS INACTIVE NOTICE


[18-Apr-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
LEGIT GOES TO THE DAY HE PLANS TO RESIGN

I‚Äôve seen Darren on games too


[18-Apr-20 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
And school does not go through July AT ALL.


[18-Apr-20 06:29 PM] ethan;#0003
Darren was at my session the other day


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Should I add him to be in the inactive list


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
No


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Him doing 1 session ever 2 months is not active


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
he has a notice


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
Did we ever make that announcement about inactive notices?


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Ethan he has a notice that goes to the day he wants to resign


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
oh-


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs legit doing nothing until July


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
31st


[18-Apr-20 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
then we should message him


[18-Apr-20 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
Because he wants to resign on his like 3 year anniversary


[18-Apr-20 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
Yes because he‚Äôs really taking up a senior spot


[18-Apr-20 06:31 PM] ethan;#0003
same with bearvish


[18-Apr-20 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs said himself he‚Äôs resigning in July


[18-Apr-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
LIKE SERIOUSLY


[18-Apr-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000

‚Äú4 more months‚Äù


[18-Apr-20 06:32 PM] ethan;#0003
like if a senior doesnt have 50 comments


[18-Apr-20 06:32 PM] ethan;#0003
then they are inactive


[18-Apr-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
He wants to stay a senior for 4 more months doing nothing nothing


[18-Apr-20 06:32 PM] ethan;#0003
unless they are new


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
Darren has never had over 50 comments


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs been a senior for months now


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] ethan;#0003
old checlists he did


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
He was active when he first was senior


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] ethan;#0003
the old checklists he had like 200?


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
For like 2-3 months


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y would


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
he make a notice


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
for the day he resigns


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
But the new checklists have been here awhile now


[18-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y noy just resign


[18-Apr-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying


[18-Apr-20 06:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hes taking a spot someone else could take


[18-Apr-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
Darren is holding an active senior spot just so he can resign on his 3 year anniversary


[18-Apr-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
Because he‚Äôs selfish and if he wants to actually resign on his terms he should be active until then


[18-Apr-20 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm putting him in inactive seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
So if he gets enough votes I‚Äôll send him the inactive letter myself


[18-Apr-20 06:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
shouldnt someone tell him he cant have his notice


[18-Apr-20 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
He has had that notice forever


[18-Apr-20 06:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we shouldnt allow notices like that


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
We should have a limit on how long people can go inactive


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
Because honestly I think if its more then 2 months why are they still an MR


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u mean


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
Or at least not updating their notice


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they dont do anything


[18-Apr-20 06:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
in the 2 months


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
not if the notice is for 2 months


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
If they don‚Äôt update their notice


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
And have a notice that‚Äôs like


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
5+ months long like darrens


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
Then like why


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
maybe


[18-Apr-20 06:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
notices shouldnt be used as some sort of way to stay in their position


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and do nothing


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to say basically


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we should make that a rule or something


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc im sure lots of mrs r doing that


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
Like if they have a notice that‚Äôs 2+ months long why are they an MR


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] ethan;#0003
bearvish is inactive but he has a good reason and he isnt resigning when he gets back


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i mean


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
2 months isnt that long


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bman


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
goes to camp for 2-3 months so


[18-Apr-20 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm not really worried about bearvish


[18-Apr-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs Darren


[18-Apr-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so maybe 4+ months?


[18-Apr-20 06:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[18-Apr-20 06:39 PM] ethan;#0003
since january


[18-Apr-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm adding Daren to inactive seniors rn


[18-Apr-20 06:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
k


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
If you agree on my points on Darren vote on it


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] bman#0435
can we reevaluate our inactivity policy


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
And you can‚Äôt say he hosts once every 2 months that he‚Äôs active


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] bman#0435
too many mrs put the end date at unknown


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
Yes we need to


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] bman#0435
i put joey and ethan up


[18-Apr-20 06:41 PM] bman#0435
but min archived


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] bman#0435
im bringing them back up


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
If they don‚Äôt put an end date and they go inactive for 4+ months


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] bman#0435
they havent attended a session since the start of 2020


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
They shouldn‚Äôt be an MR then


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
Ok add it again


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
I voted on it


[18-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
And I will again


[18-Apr-20 06:44 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly I think if they have a notice, regardless if they are inactive for 4+ months we should at least message them


[18-Apr-20 06:44 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm gonna make an announcement


[18-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[18-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
their notice can be however long they want


[18-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
IF


[18-Apr-20 06:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they do something


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like do stuff 2 sort of remain active


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like 1-2 sessions in 2 months


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
is no


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but like if they did something 2 or 3 times a week


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
They need to at least keep in contact with us


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] emma;#1525
I feel like someone needs to be the head of inactivity notices lmao


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then it think it should be fine


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm making an announcement


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
Rn


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
But please


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Why don‚Äôt we make a max limit for notices


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
Go vote on Darren thing I added for inactive seniors


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u mean


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
per person


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And then have them extend as needed by contacting an HR with reason


[18-Apr-20 06:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[18-Apr-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
I have a whole argument against Darren being inactive if you disagree with why I see he‚Äôs inactive


[18-Apr-20 06:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
O I‚Äôm still a business partner in Koala LOL


[18-Apr-20 06:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[18-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[18-Apr-20 06:57 PM] katie#0200
literally every time we're in a vc he talks about how he's resigning on the 31st of july and says the next time he'll host is on his last day

[18-Apr-20 06:57 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Apr-20 06:59 PM] katie#0200
maybe we could also make a list of valid reasons instead of just accepting every inactivity notice we get allowing everyone to go inactive for as long as they want @stacey if they have another situation they can ask to make an exception or something


[18-Apr-20 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
I like the idea of 1 month max and then updating us if notices are longer


[18-Apr-20 06:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but i don't think it's very good


[18-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ur not friended with bear? @ethan;


[18-Apr-20 06:59 PM] ethan;#0003

i think i did


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
ive had a friend request pending since v3


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
Trey that‚Äôs him legit doing reports


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@katie he talks a lot on the discord


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
He doesn‚Äôt host anything


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
dm them


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
2 accept


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya i see darren on disc sometimes


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
those are two not good signs we're dealing with


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
He can‚Äôt just do reports and think that‚Äôs active


[18-Apr-20 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
He needs to actually host


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hes online enough to be able to host


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] katie#0200
he told me hes gonna host on july 30th :>


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] katie#0200
so thats helpful


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
The day before he resigns


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's not exactly him helping considering that we have managements who not only do them also, but are better at it


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that won‚Äôt work for me


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] katie#0200
exactly jdfnm


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like let's use lyoo for example


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
His inactive notice ends on the day he resigns


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] katie#0200
we could have someone in his position actually helping


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[18-Apr-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they both do constant reports but he's like a management and doing better than he is with activity

what is that


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not saying i want him promoted but you get my point


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
Like sorry we don‚Äôt need him sitting around doing nothing for 3 months just so he can resign when he wants


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] katie#0200
exactly


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
when a management has more senior activity capability than him, its pretty sad


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] katie#0200
sorry but if hes going to do nothing until he resigns why doesnt he just resign now


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
at least with fraux, he had a good reason


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc he wants to save his spot


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
for no reason


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
We only need 5 votes to send a letter right


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] katie#0200
thats unfair


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
So we got 5


[18-Apr-20 07:02 PM] katie#0200
on managements


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
dont u need bod approval


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
to send


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think so but like


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2 gms are bod anyways


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
That or 2 GM= BOD


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
@emma;


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; i think we need someone in charge of inactive notices


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
stacey


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
So we both agree

mhm


[18-Apr-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

He‚Äôd fire me


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
Ok we got 3 GM approval


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
We can‚Äôt just fire Darren


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435
STOP I MEANT KIKI


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
LOL


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
Let‚Äôs send Darren the letter now


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
OMG


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
But we can send him an inactivity letter


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
**kiko**


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
And give him a chance to get his activity back up


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah that's what we're planning on


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
And we can fire him if he doesn‚Äôt improve


[18-Apr-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
Which he‚Äôll prob do for a week lol


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
And then go inactive again


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
Also


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
If he does that then he gets fired


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] bman#0435
like leak


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like how he's handling his whole inactivity


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
lol


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
me neither


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but part of the letter is that he needs to stay consistent or he'll get demoted anyway?


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
Can we make a rule that if an MR doesn‚Äôt put an end date on their inactivity notice they have to renew them every month


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
hes saving a space for a potential active senior


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mhm @emma;


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
He can‚Äôt just come active for a week to keep his rank then go inactive again for 3 months


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i like that idea


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
So that way if people actually have to go inactive for a long time they have to at least put effort into it


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's a good concept


[18-Apr-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
yes


[18-Apr-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
instead of just putting the card up and never returning again


[18-Apr-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
Ok


[18-Apr-20 07:06 PM] ethan;#0003
@bman who is far


[18-Apr-20 07:06 PM] ethan;#0003

[18-Apr-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
Would anyone like to announce that


[18-Apr-20 07:06 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so we good to send Darren an inactive letter

[18-Apr-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs been inactive forever and he‚Äôs been saying he‚Äôs resigning July 31st and that‚Äôs when his notice ends


[18-Apr-20 08:20 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[18-Apr-20 08:20 PM] Cam#5887
hes way too inactive


[18-Apr-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
So basically he‚Äôs wasting an active senior spot just so he can resign when he wants and thinks he can be inactive for 3 months


[18-Apr-20 08:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Greetings Darren,

The High-Rank team has been monitoring your activity and has noticed you have been inactive for quite some time now. We understand you may have an inactive notice, but your inactive notice extends for a period of time. We are also aware you plan on resigning soon, but that does not mean you can go inactive until then. We will give you 2 weeks to improve your activity. If you have ant questions or concerns please message me or any member of the HR team. 

Sincerely,
staceyzn
General Manager

[18-Apr-20 10:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah he ain‚Äôt ever getting MR again but like he can still I‚Äôm saying for the actions he was fired for, basically being a stalker and pedophile I thought he was blacklisted


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
He can still do that to people


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
As an LR


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he isn't really a pedophile


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
But it‚Äôs too late


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
He still stalked people


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
And tried to online date


[18-Apr-20 10:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

ok


[18-Apr-20 10:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; no, I'm the only one who deals with alliances and events the most so I'll be keeping my alliance rep spots


[18-Apr-20 10:56 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn You are inactive and currently in 5 so you need to temporarily give at least 3 away because your activity is not reliable enough since you're on notice


[18-Apr-20 10:57 PM] emma;#1525
And we all agree and will have a vote to override that if necessary


[18-Apr-20 10:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
Pretty sure my notice said I'm still on here and there


[18-Apr-20 10:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
In fact I'm still on daily I've just lost a bit of motivation lately


[18-Apr-20 10:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
Literally nobody else ever deals with the organization of events and alliances other than you and me so I'm quite rightfully going to be keeping my representative roles. I also can't oversee the representing HRs if I don't have the roles. Emma needs to tone down her hunger for power.


[18-Apr-20 10:58 PM] emma;#1525
If you're on inactivity notice then you aren't going to be able to keep up your main responsibilities, and the fact that you are taking all the rep spots and not letting anyone else have a chance is unfair and that's not me wanting power bc I don't even want another spot


[18-Apr-20 10:58 PM] emma;#1525
I want the 5 people with 0 rep spots to have a chance


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] xM_inn#2821
Just calm down, it's like you're tryna get rid of me from everything


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] emma;#1525
You got upset that we all called you out and went on inactivity notice bc you had a temper tantrum


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] emma;#1525
Sorry that I don't trust you to be in power any more


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think he is


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] emma;#1525
You put ramm in charge of alliances but won't even let him do what he thinks is right


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] emma;#1525
He wanted to replace you too


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She*


[18-Apr-20 10:59 PM] emma;#1525
But he didn't think you would comply because YOU have a need for power


[18-Apr-20 11:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think ramm would be great for us considering he has the experience that he needs


[18-Apr-20 11:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But yeah


[18-Apr-20 11:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma's kind of right tbh


[18-Apr-20 11:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Hold on


[18-Apr-20 11:00 PM] emma;#1525
All I'm saying is you can't leave us high and dry because you got upset that we wanted to hold you accountable to your position in this group and then get mad when we try to redistribute your jobs that you aren't doing because you're inactive


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
Either be a BOD or be inactive


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
You can't be a slightly inactive BOD


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
he only put me in charge of apps


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly dont know why I'm bothering here anymore. If we want to sort out representative spots then I'll just make it 3 set HRs for all groups and then nobody can complain thsy they're left out.


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
not all ally stuff


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
Minn you don't need to be a rep at 5 groups


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not entirely true but I see ur point lol @emma;


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
Bloo, story, cam, mack, bliss... they dont have a single one


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not asking for myself


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bloo is at koala now


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Where's everyone else


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
I'm asking for the people who aren't being given the chance because you won't be generous


[18-Apr-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
Ramm gave up TWO spots for other people


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I updated the list on ally board


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I left 2 of mine, I'm down to 1


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525
Minn can you honestly explain why you think it's fair you get 5 spots while your FRIENDS get 0


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
actually two because koala kept me lol


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525
If you have a good reason (and no, I don't think "I'm head of alliances" is a good one) then that will help me understand your point of view


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
Literally nobody else ever deals with the organization of events and alliances other than you and me so I'm quite rightfully going to be keeping my representative roles. I also can't oversee the representing HRs if I don't have the roles.


[18-Apr-20 11:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
Do I need to spam that for you to understand?


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] emma;#1525
Other HRs don't do it because they aren't being given the chance to rep us


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Woah minn calm down


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] emma;#1525
How are they supposed to work with groups and organize events if they aren't allied reps anywhere


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] emma;#1525
Minn you can do your whole job and organize events without being an allied rep at 5 groups


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not trying to be rude but that sounded a little passive aggressive


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm agreeing with Emma. It‚Äôs just fairness to everyone if they get a chance to at being an alliance representative. Every HR is capable of it and if there was any problems people would contact you. You just need to trust us.


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not saying I don't want you to be able to still do events stuff, you're our head of alliances so you already get to be an allied rep technically without even having the role


[18-Apr-20 11:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I'm with Stacey here


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
You giving others the official role just lets more people have a chance


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
And I think that would be great


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
And it doesn't harm you at all


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
Or put you in a position to do less


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] stacey#1000
Minn you don‚Äôt need to supervise us on everything. You need to trust us and give us the chance to do stuff.


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If you gave us a chance to take over the investigation team


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
I've never planned ally events, honestly, because I don't feel like I'm "supposed" to because that's always been your thing Minn


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think we could transition well with alliances


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] emma;#1525
And I don't think allies view me like they view you


[18-Apr-20 11:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'm not taking sides here but if you look through ally announcements it seems like there is a variety of HRs who contribute to the channel


[18-Apr-20 11:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm


[18-Apr-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve never had the chance to contribute much to alliances because I‚Äôve never had the chance to be an alliance representative until recently.


[18-Apr-20 11:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
I've been repping allies and doing events since may last year which was when I became BOD and literally nobody has ever helped, particularly with the planning or creation of events. The only person you ever seem to see planning events is me. I'm not giving up my alliance spots when people  haven't worked as hard on communications with alliances.


[18-Apr-20 11:06 PM] emma;#1525
We've never been allowed to


[18-Apr-20 11:06 PM] emma;#1525
Since when have we been allowed to contact allies and do stuff


[18-Apr-20 11:06 PM] emma;#1525
Last time I worked with an ally I got in trouble bc they treated me like trash


[18-Apr-20 11:06 PM] emma;#1525
So


[18-Apr-20 11:06 PM] emma;#1525
Forgive me for not wanting to plan events when y'all gave me 0 support on that


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] stacey#1000
No one has even been given the opportunity to even try really when not everyone is an alliance rep.


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Theres been plenty of spot openings


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] emma;#1525
You always take one


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] emma;#1525
Ramm has taken the others (but he gave 2 up so I'm okay with that)


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] emma;#1525
And then MAYBE one new person gets one


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
If you're not gonna appreciate the way the representative spots right now then it'll be made to 3 particular HRs for each group


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
But the fact that we have like 30 spots total, way less than 30 HRs, and not everyone even gets a chance is ridiculous


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
Why can't you understand that we all want a fair chance for those who haven't gotten one


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
I'd give up my spot if I had an extra but I only have one


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] emma;#1525
It's not that big of a deal minn and you're acting like we're asking you to resign


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
I would as well. It‚Äôs just trusting us and allowing us to see how it goes.


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright people who've been old representatives can have their spots removed and be replaced with people who haven't been a representative then


[18-Apr-20 11:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
how about this: we do a total new ally role hand out. boba does that every 6 months


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
How about Minn grows up and plays fair and gives people like 2 of his spots


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
I don't see why people with one rep need to give it up


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that wasn't needed


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
When you have 5 and you don't even announce stuff that much


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
None of this attitude from anyone is needed but it's how Minn is leading so it's how we're communicating


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
No but I communicate with all of them


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
If Minn was open to a calm and fair discussion then I'd give him one


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
You can do that without having the allied rep roles Minn


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
Why don't you understand that


[18-Apr-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525
You are our head of alliances


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] stacey#1000
Minn if you‚Äôre willing to change the alliance reps to 3 to one group, the same should go for you, you don‚Äôt need to be a rep at so many.


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I would just give the roles to be honest


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey No he wants to pick 3 people total and they rep every group


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
That's what he means


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Fair and calm discussions are impossible here lately


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] stacey#1000
Oh.


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
Only when you refuse to listen


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
We've had a lot of good ideas get passed recently


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
We can't do that without fair and calm discussions


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
We've actually solved a lot today if I'm being honest


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] emma;#1525
A pretty productive day


[18-Apr-20 11:10 PM] stacey#1000
We have honestly.


[18-Apr-20 11:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3 senior promotions coming soon and a change to inactivity


[18-Apr-20 11:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's pretty productive if you ask me


[18-Apr-20 11:11 PM] emma;#1525
My favorite thing about this HR team is how we can do literally anything by voting on it and I'm fully prepared to do that to give everyone the fair chance they deserve


[18-Apr-20 11:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok so it becomes unfair and uncalm when people dont listen to emma, well I've made my decision regarding the representative spots and its staying that way for now. I'll change it again when I'm off notice, I want to see how the new representatives do.


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn I think it makes sense to do it now


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
THat's your choice but you made the choice to focus on other groups


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Allies isnt your jurisdiction emma so the vote  isnt relevant


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
So I think the HRs who actually want to commit to this group can make that choice


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
Because the rest of us are in this through the hard times


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
ANd you being petty and saying if I don't get my way I get upset, when literally everyone is agreeing with me, shows you are petty and immature


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
Oh I used petty twice


[18-Apr-20 11:12 PM] emma;#1525
Oops


[18-Apr-20 11:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Rip


[18-Apr-20 11:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But honestly though


[18-Apr-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
Anyways clearly Minn is incapable of having a conversation in which everyone thinks one thing and he thinks another so what's the point of doing anything, Minn can just override it


[18-Apr-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
Sorry to everyone, like Bloo, a fellow BOD, who's getting screwed over


[18-Apr-20 11:14 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt understand the point in waiting honestly. It feels like you‚Äôre saying you don‚Äôt trust us to allow those that want a representative spot to try it out by not giving up even one of your spots.


[18-Apr-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Honestly tho


[18-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
He doesn't want to give up power, so he's accusing ME of trying to make a power grab


[18-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
???


[18-Apr-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
You knew I was a bitch when you hired me so deal with it


[18-Apr-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If we're able to be productive today, I don't think there's much of a problem doing it now


[18-Apr-20 11:15 PM] stacey#1000
This is just about fairness to everyone on HR team, so we all get a chance to try something if we want to.

is min still allied rep at 5 places?


[18-Apr-20 11:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I see the prepective that min is coming from: He is saying that he usually is the one who deals with the ally stuff and has been doing it for a while now. Min has taken up a lot of work with allies for sure. He has created a lot of events for us and those events require a ton of planning and coordination in order to get everything working properly for everyone. Min is most comfortable keeping those roles because he has done so many different things in the past compared to giving it to a person who hasn't had much alliance experience.

The side that everyone else is trying to convey is that the ally stuff is a lot of work. You wouldn't be stripped away from all of your ally roles at all, but rather the workload would be transferred to another person rather than someone who has a lot on their plate already with not only our group, but other groups as well. Since Min is taking some time away from Bloxton for other groups, it's hard to see Min maintaining constant communication with all 5 allies, creating events, and coordinating while you are working on other groups. The people who want to give the roles to the people who haven't had a previous experience believe that we can benefit by having new people come in with possibly some new ideas to further strengthen the bond with our allies.


[18-Apr-20 11:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For now


[18-Apr-20 11:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

It is

[19-Apr-20 12:58 AM] emma;#1525
Idk I call myself annoying all the time now bc it's my justification for not shutting up so


[19-Apr-20 12:58 AM] emma;#1525

[19-Apr-20 12:59 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Apr-20 01:00 AM] emma;#1525
being a genuinely bad person...


[19-Apr-20 01:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Apr-20 01:00 AM] bman#0435

[19-Apr-20 01:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
the investigation team (if it is one) wasn't very good


[19-Apr-20 01:00 AM] bman#0435
AND BOMB EVERY OTHER TOWER


[19-Apr-20 01:00 AM] bman#0435

maybe 4 times total


[19-Apr-20 01:17 AM] emma;#1525

[19-Apr-20 01:17 AM] bman#0435
ew


[19-Apr-20 01:17 AM] emma;#1525
drunk me just thinks its fun to try then drunk me quickly remembers why it IS NOT FUN


[19-Apr-20 01:17 AM] bman#0435
lungs be like ‚ö´ ‚ö´


[19-Apr-20 01:18 AM] emma;#1525
idk why vaping is such a big thing like it's just annoying to everyone around you


[19-Apr-20 01:18 AM] emma;#1525
and it literally puts solidified oil in your lungs


[19-Apr-20 01:18 AM] emma;#1525
and destroys them


[19-Apr-20 01:18 AM] emma;#1525
literally melts your lungs


[19-Apr-20 01:18 AM] emma;#1525
people are dying from it and ITS STILL A BIG THING


[19-Apr-20 01:18 AM] bman#0435
its disgusting and people who buy puffs and are like "its so good" or "its addicting" are the same people who do it to just fit in lmfao


[19-Apr-20 01:19 AM] emma;#1525
i have a friend who claims she does it bc of anxiety


[19-Apr-20 01:19 AM] emma;#1525
like girl if your anxiety is that bad you need to go get some anti anxiety drugs


[19-Apr-20 01:19 AM] emma;#1525
but she refuses to get any sort of medication bc it's "weak" of her


[19-Apr-20 01:19 AM] emma;#1525
BUT VAPING ISN'T WEAK APPARENTLY

I think manager checklists would be alright since they do have minimum requirements but we don‚Äôt check that on a weekly basis


[19-Apr-20 08:41 AM] Polk#1596

[19-Apr-20 08:41 AM] Polk#1596

[19-Apr-20 08:41 AM] Polk#1596

THANKS :D @RAMMGaming


[19-Apr-20 10:27 AM] Polk#1596
no, i used after effects once and i barely understood any of it


[19-Apr-20 10:27 AM] Polk#1596
so what i did was get baby to send the logo to me


[19-Apr-20 10:27 AM] Polk#1596
then i made a text in photoshop with like the same look


[19-Apr-20 10:27 AM] Polk#1596
and then i used filmora to just make the transition between the two images


[19-Apr-20 10:28 AM] Polk#1596
idk how to do more advanced stuff


[19-Apr-20 10:28 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
oooo nice


[19-Apr-20 10:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I've trying to learn AE


[19-Apr-20 10:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I started doing a animation for Boba but he wants something simlar to koala and I have no idea the right combo of effects to get it like that


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] Polk#1596
BRUH


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] Polk#1596
koala mustve hired a professional for it


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] Polk#1596
its not easy to just make that


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] Polk#1596
yeah, it looks like some


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
So the pop effect isn't hard


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] Polk#1596
bubble effect is used


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It's the striped effect


[19-Apr-20 10:30 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
w/ the background


[19-Apr-20 10:31 AM] Polk#1596

[19-Apr-20 10:31 AM] Polk#1596

[19-Apr-20 10:33 AM] Polk#1596

[19-Apr-20 10:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[19-Apr-20 10:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
this is where I left off


[19-Apr-20 10:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I never got passed the colors lol


[19-Apr-20 10:33 AM] Polk#1596
bruh


[19-Apr-20 10:34 AM] Polk#1596
he isnt making it very easy for u


[19-Apr-20 10:34 AM] Polk#1596
hm


[19-Apr-20 10:34 AM] Polk#1596
yeah their color theme is kinda weird


[19-Apr-20 10:34 AM] Polk#1596
its like yellowish and red


[19-Apr-20 10:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye those were just the options lol


[19-Apr-20 10:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He wants light pink and blue


[19-Apr-20 10:42 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Those colors were based off the logo


[19-Apr-20 11:39 AM] bman#0435
@xM_inn can u say why joey and ethans inactive notice watches keep getting archived with no reason please


[19-Apr-20 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
read the cards


[19-Apr-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
theyre both indeed loophole notices


[19-Apr-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
neither have an ending date, they havent attended a session since the start of 2020


[19-Apr-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
and if ur getting updates on joeys inactivity then why isnt it being added to his card on the mb?


[19-Apr-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
also i thought the whole point of noting down inactive mrs was to reach out to them and see if theyll be active again or not and why


[19-Apr-20 11:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
reach out to ethan unofficially and ask him about it first


[19-Apr-20 11:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
it doesnt look very professional if we're assuming its a loophole


[19-Apr-20 11:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
do we have any factual evidence to suggest it's a loophole? i don't believe we do


[19-Apr-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
neither if them have ending dates and they havent been to a session since the start of 2020


[19-Apr-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
the endless notice is a loophole


[19-Apr-20 11:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
and if their devices genuinely aren't working?


[19-Apr-20 11:47 AM] bman#0435
im not exactly willing to pull another fraux and let an mr keep their position for nearly a year and do nothing between it


[19-Apr-20 11:47 AM] bman#0435
not sure about the others but it was pretty ridiculous


[19-Apr-20 11:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
fraux and ethan are two entirely different cases


[19-Apr-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
fraux technically let us knew what was going on


[19-Apr-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
well if youre regularly getting updates from joey you may as well attach them to the card or send them here


[19-Apr-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
and i guess ill reach out to ethan if its that much of an issue

THERES 10


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
the point is bman, hes giving updates


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
so it isnt a loophole


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
its clearly genuine


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
its not like hes put up his notice


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
and we havent seen


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
him


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] xM_inn#2821

[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] bman#0435
leak last attended a real session may of last year


[19-Apr-20 11:52 AM] bman#0435
lmfao


[19-Apr-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
no idea how leak got away with that for so long


[19-Apr-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
but


[19-Apr-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
hes got 2 weeks to get himself sorted


[19-Apr-20 11:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
or bye bye


[19-Apr-20 11:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
and tbh with ethan, idc if you send the notice officially or unofficially, but granted its only been a few months i just think its a wise option to do it in the form of a casual checkup


[19-Apr-20 11:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[19-Apr-20 12:22 PM] bman#0435
i just wanna know


[19-Apr-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Apr-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435
WHY TF DID YALL VOTE FOR HIM TO BE SENIOR LIKE WTF WERE YALL THINKUNG


[19-Apr-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
Because he was actually active


[19-Apr-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
Didn‚Äôt think it would turn out like this


[19-Apr-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435
o i KNEW he would do something selfish to his extebt


[19-Apr-20 12:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I wouldn‚Äôt really call it a ‚Äútermination‚Äù moreeee like he‚Äôs being let go lol

[19-Apr-20 12:24 PM] bman#0435

[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] bman#0435
@stacey imagine not being my senior promo buddy and it was kiki


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Darren is being demoted technically


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
@bman Omg ikr


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
:crab_rave: :crab_rave: :crab_rave:


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But yeah


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wouldn't be too surprised if he doesn't step it up


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
I see it‚Äôs not like a termination exactly cause it‚Äôs demotion for inactivity


[19-Apr-20 12:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
:emma:


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
As I said I just want to be the one to demote him


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] bman#0435
if we demote then that means hes rank 11


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
no


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I was just about to say that bman


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
Rank 1


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
He won‚Äôt be active as any MR position


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we are?


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] bman#0435
demote is to bring down one rank


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] bman#0435
terminate is remove it fully and goving lowest rank


[19-Apr-20 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so I‚Äôm terminating him then


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I ain‚Äôt letting him keep an MR rank


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
Like no thanks


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
no trey


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
no


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
no


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
no


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs just gonna resign in 3 months anyway


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
no


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The way a demotion works is that they're being dropped down to LR


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
actually can we let him resign when im at camp


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
.


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
.


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
.


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôll demote him to rank 6


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
Just not an MR rank


[19-Apr-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
huh


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Dang a lot of y'all really hate him lol


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
y u demoting to lr rank


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I see why tho


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
TREY OMLLLL


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] stacey#1000
I didn‚Äôt always as I said I use to be good friends with him


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
dont get me STARTED


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
hes so self-centered and selfish


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] stacey#1000
But lately his selfishness has pissed me off


[19-Apr-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
and generally no one likes him because he ‚Äúrecords vcs‚Äù and is just annoys them in general


[19-Apr-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
Like if you want to resign on your terms in July, don‚Äôt be selfish inactive until then for months. That‚Äôs not how it works. It‚Äôs called you be active and then you can resign when you want on your terms


[19-Apr-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
when i tell u i was shocked he got manager


[19-Apr-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
i was SHOCKED


[19-Apr-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
He use to be so active


[19-Apr-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
But not now


[19-Apr-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
All because of his mindset he‚Äôs resigning soon


[19-Apr-20 12:41 PM] katie#0200
sometimes he joins my sessions to say hi or whatever


[19-Apr-20 12:41 PM] katie#0200
so like


[19-Apr-20 12:41 PM] katie#0200
i cant assume he hasnt got other stuff to do but like if he stays for a long period of time in my server then he should be able to host instead


[19-Apr-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
lol imag does the same


[19-Apr-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
she says she cant host but then shell attend a session


[19-Apr-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ


[19-Apr-20 12:43 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[19-Apr-20 12:43 PM] katie#0200
thing is she came to my session WITH darren üíÄ


[19-Apr-20 12:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Omg she annoys me so much to the point where if I‚Äôm talking on staff lounge and she tags me about the convo we‚Äôre talking about I just ignore her üò∂


[19-Apr-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
LMFAO KATIE


[19-Apr-20 12:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like I‚Äôm sorry but when I‚Äôm annoyed with someone like that I just ignore them üíÄ


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
she gonna turn into holly and saab soon enough


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] katie#0200
lolol


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] katie#0200
there were 2 servers that couldnt be hosted bc of a lack of seniors


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] katie#0200
but then 2 seniors show up to my server...


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] katie#0200
like ok.......


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
OMG I HATE THAT


[19-Apr-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
THEY JOIN OTHER SENIOR SERVERS


[19-Apr-20 12:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey no no, dont fire, we demote to LR


[19-Apr-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435

[19-Apr-20 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821

[19-Apr-20 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821

there is no way alistele can get senior, we almost had to give her a writen warning for leaving sessions without telling the host to go to other servers


[19-Apr-20 04:27 PM] bman#0435
im not rly sure how i feel about another channel being added, as it would just be pretty overwhelming looking at the amount of channels they have. also, if they were given perms to tag the mr team, i feel like it would just be easily abused by them to get them to join a game. i just dont like the general idea of the tagging part


[19-Apr-20 04:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
whats the difference between that and posting in SL


[19-Apr-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
i dont have an issue with them hosting gamenights, its just the thought of another channel being added and pinging


[19-Apr-20 04:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
SL works for me


[19-Apr-20 04:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I wouldn't be against a new channel though so I'm neutral


[19-Apr-20 04:29 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; ya same with acelesteq lol literally been a manager for a month and follows every hr around


[19-Apr-20 04:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but you have a point mr bean


[19-Apr-20 04:29 PM] bman#0435
ty rmaam


[19-Apr-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
true, we have so many channels at this point


[19-Apr-20 04:32 PM] Polk#1596
emmas idea isn't bad though


[19-Apr-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming the point with it not being in SL is that it can be super hard to find specific posts in SL if a lot of people are talking and I didn‚Äôt want them to have to repost the link 300000 times


[19-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
If you guys are worried about a new channel added, would you consider letting seniors have speaking perms in announcements then with strict rules that they can ONLY speak in there if it‚Äôs for a game night


[19-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
And any other things they put in there would be a warning


[19-Apr-20 04:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I like that


[19-Apr-20 04:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but could add like a schedule on senior board so we don‚Äôt have like 3-4 pings of games on there everyday. like 2 games a day and seniors can schedule them in advanced


[19-Apr-20 04:40 PM] bman#0435
ik this is bad but i can already tell megan will be like @mrteam JOIN THE GAME NIGHT @mrteam WE NEED 5 MORE PEOPLE @mrteam JOIN JOIN JOIN


[19-Apr-20 04:41 PM] bman#0435
if she did happen to host


[19-Apr-20 04:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
one more channel wouldn't hurt


[19-Apr-20 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
I figured out how to host movie nights too


[19-Apr-20 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm watching Onward rn with Megan, blaire, maya from my pc and it works great


[19-Apr-20 04:43 PM] emma;#1525
@bman that‚Äôs why i clearly said they only get to ping ONCE when announcing the game night and once with the link when it‚Äôs starting


[19-Apr-20 04:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what app Stacey


[19-Apr-20 04:43 PM] emma;#1525
And if they‚Äôre hosting the game immediately they only get one ping


[19-Apr-20 04:43 PM] emma;#1525
I did think this through a tiny bit Bman lol


[19-Apr-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs called Kast


[19-Apr-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm gonna try hosting a movie night in my own discord


[19-Apr-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
Because this works amazing. It replaced rabit


[19-Apr-20 04:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It‚Äôs not laggy?


[19-Apr-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000

Bloo come to my movie night!


[19-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
in a movie


[19-Apr-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
No


[19-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; idk


[19-Apr-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Well it depends if you put it on private or public


[19-Apr-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm gonna do it for private and you can get like 18 people on it for it being private. Or do public and a lot can join


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez can you come to my movie night at 8


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
You can see what it‚Äôs like


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sure


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@emma; honestly make it HR only to post and tag and have seniors request games


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They can host just not post


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
Oki so in 2 hours I‚Äôll DM you the invite thing


[19-Apr-20 04:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Haha that rhymes


[19-Apr-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming The whole point is for us not to need any involvement bc as it stands, we very rarely even host gamenights. I'm putting a strict list of rules up with this and we'll see how it goes, and we can make adjustments or just totally cancel the concept as needed but I don't want us to get in a loop of seniors having to ask 6 different HRs to announce a gamenight and all of us getting super annoying


[19-Apr-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
Y'all can show a bit more trust in the seniors than what I'm seeing from a lot of you right now... they're not babies lol if we set up strict guidelines and follow through on warnings if needed I don't think it's going to be an issue, but again we'll see how it goes and make chances as necessary


[19-Apr-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
Don't let worrying about imag ruin everyone else's chances


[19-Apr-20 04:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Lowkey it‚Äôs just imag I‚Äôm worried about LOL


[19-Apr-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
@bman uh it doesnt seem like jessie misread it in my opinion


[19-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
my bets are kenzi called her out so she's trying to act like it was a mistake so she doesnt get in trouble


[19-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
i mean where in those screenshots does it show her even saying the "bad" thing, all it shows it "i was joking omg"


[19-Apr-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
read the second screenshot

[19-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
how does "suck me off" get mistaked for "fight me off"


[19-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
wtf does fight me off even mean


[19-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
also kenzi is full within her right to report jessie for that so why would we punish kenzi, even if it was a true mistake on jessie's part

[19-Apr-20 05:06 PM] bman#0435
she was being pretty rude


[19-Apr-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah she just saw someone apparently tell a guy she'd suck them off


[19-Apr-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
I wouldn't be too happy about that either bman


[19-Apr-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
We aren't going to extend kenzi's suspension based off of those two messages she sent lmao that's ridiculous. If she continues talking to jessie and making it a bigger situation we can consider it


[19-Apr-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
If kenzi wasn't suspended, we wouldn't suspend her for it right?


[19-Apr-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
Also why would jessie say "I was joking" instead of "omg I read that wrong"..?


[19-Apr-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
That shows me that she didn't say what she did on accident... because she claims it was a joke... aka she said it but "didn't mean it" but still said it intentionally. Idk just my thoughts based on the very small amounts of proof given.


[19-Apr-20 05:10 PM] bman#0435
ill ask her


[19-Apr-20 05:13 PM] bman#0435

the funny part is that even if she did jokingly respond to what that guy said, it wouldn't be something I'd want to suspend her for lmao


[19-Apr-20 05:32 PM] emma;#1525

If we can change settings


[19-Apr-20 07:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
19. You may only have one open ticket at a time using our ticket system. If you are found to have made duplicate tickets both will be closed and a an warning will be issued.


[19-Apr-20 07:38 PM] bonnie591#0591

[20-Apr-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435
especially with themed ones

ik how to set it up


[20-Apr-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
and we make a bloxton server on it where they can play music


[20-Apr-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
and then we can select moderators


[20-Apr-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
who can skip the song if its innapropriate


[20-Apr-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003

[20-Apr-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003

for music nights


[20-Apr-20 03:28 PM] ethan;#0003

[20-Apr-20 04:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
how does it work


[20-Apr-20 04:12 PM] ethan;#0003
You make an account


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] ethan;#0003
You can add songs to a queue


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] ethan;#0003
and they can not be skipped unless voted off or a moderator removes it


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think u need an account tho


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] ethan;#0003
So we wouldn't have random people skipping


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] ethan;#0003
It is very easy.


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] ethan;#0003
Just username and password.


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it says


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
sign up with email


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
I don't like the idea of giving LRs any chances to queue up inappropriate songs that can only be removed if a moderator is paying attention


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
HOLY SHIT


[20-Apr-20 04:13 PM] emma;#1525
That's the whole reason we don't have a music bot


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
IM DOING SOMETHING FOR A HOCKEY GUY I WORK WITH


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] emma;#1525
and I don't see how this is really any different... except its not a bot?


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
AND HE USES TRELLO HAHAHAHAHAHA


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
a hockey guy?


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] ethan;#0003
That isnt the point emma


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] ethan;#0003
If it is innapropriate, we would get the account banned


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes he was the captain for the NJ devils in 2012


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] ethan;#0003
and we would have a lot of moderators


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
oooooooooooooo


[20-Apr-20 04:14 PM] ethan;#0003
and we can close the channel if a moderator isnt in it


[20-Apr-20 04:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
little does he know im the master of trello because of bloxton LOL


[20-Apr-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
Our moderators barely pay attention to general discussion


[20-Apr-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
I don't trust them to moderate this as well


[20-Apr-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
assuming the moderators are managers+ bc that's the only thing that would make sense


[20-Apr-20 04:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that if we were gonna give music to everyone


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it might as well just be in the discord


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
with a role or something


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] ethan;#0003
we can set it to the room is only open if a moderator is in it


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
If they want music so bad, most of them are in other servers with music bots


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they could also technically join a vc and put music into their mic


[20-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so

@ethan; This makes you sign up, meaning people can set their user to literally anything


[20-Apr-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
Idk I just don't love this idea, if our whole reason for not having a music bot is that people will abuse it, this seems just as easily abused


[20-Apr-20 04:24 PM] ethan;#0003
If someone plays something innapropriate, we ban them they can never play music again


[20-Apr-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
And with our "moderation" team not even doing their job half the time i dont see how this will be better moderated when you won't even know who people are


[20-Apr-20 04:24 PM] bman#0435
emma i think thats just for djs


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
They can make a new account ethan lol


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] bman#0435
what if hrs were djs and they request songs?


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] bman#0435
or seniors+


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] bman#0435
sb has that bot i think


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
Then why not just have HRs and Seniors move the music bot to staff VCs whenever we want to play music


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i got an ideaaaaaaaaaa


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what if


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
Oh right bc no one would do that lol


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] ethan;#0003
this is so LR's can have music


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we had a music channel


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that just played music


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
all day


[20-Apr-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
LRs have access to youtube I'm not that concerned about them not having access to music


[20-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so we know what its playing


[20-Apr-20 04:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk if u can even do that tho


[20-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
You can make a long queue but idk if you can make a whole queue loop


[20-Apr-20 04:26 PM] ethan;#0003
lrs  want to play their own music


[20-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
Then they can go to.... YOUTUBE


[20-Apr-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
Or literally any of the other 100s of servers they're in with access to music bots


[20-Apr-20 04:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
YouTube has adverts


[20-Apr-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
But I KNOW that if we give them access to a bot they'll abuse it, and if we give them a website where they can sign up with a million email accounts then they'll abuse that even worse lol


[20-Apr-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
Youtube music typically won't have adverts if you're watching like a lyric video or something bc of copyright so they can't monetixe it


[20-Apr-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
monetize


[20-Apr-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; If you want to use that website, then we should do it so that only MRs can be DJs and they can host "music nights" or something where LRs can DM them requests


[20-Apr-20 04:28 PM] ethan;#0003
can we test out the website with mrs first


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] ethan;#0003
and then if that goes well we can think of lrs?


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
That's going from ~100 people using it to ~5000


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
can u even have that many ppl on the website at once


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] ethan;#0003
the largest server is a streamer with 40k viewers and his thing has 200 average


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] ethan;#0003
it wont be a lot of people


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
Not at once


[20-Apr-20 04:29 PM] ethan;#0003
probaly around 100 at once if we let LR's


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
But technically 16000 people will have access to it


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
and in those 16000 how many do you think will abuse it just bc they can


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
and we can't punish them


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
bc we literally can't prove who they are


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] ethan;#0003
not everyone will use it


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
bc they don't have to set their username as their roblox name OR they could set it as someone else's


[20-Apr-20 04:30 PM] ethan;#0003
so can I see how it goes and test it with mrs?


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think we might as well just use a music channel


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
for everyone


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if u were gonna add that


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] ethan;#0003
but we cant moderate that if no mrs are in the call


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] ethan;#0003
this website we can moderate it


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] ethan;#0003
it has logs


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
ethan


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] ethan;#0003
of the song that is played and who played it


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
yes we can ban the user that did it


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
music bot commands


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
but all you have to do to make an account is sign up with an email


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
or google address


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
you can make unlimited emails for free


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
so essentially we can't moderate this


[20-Apr-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
bc at least discord bans are usually IP bans


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] ethan;#0003
idk this website might also be email banned


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
but if we have someone who really wants to abuse the website it will be super easy for them


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
but you can make emails that aren't connected to each other


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk if anyones gonna want to sign up for that website either


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
idk I just don't really see there being a huge benefit to this vs the risks


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
but if you can get your 5 votes


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] ethan;#0003
if a lot of people use it, it takes a while for songs to get to the front of the queue, atleast one moderator would see the song and remove it before it gets to the front


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
then you have your 5 votes


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
isnt a discord bot the same


[20-Apr-20 04:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
again my point of our moderators dont even moderate general discussion that much stands and should be an indicator of how little they'll be moderating a music website


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
but


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
anyways


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] ethan;#0003
if they like to listen to music, they would use it.


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
idk we dont want to add a bot bc its hard to moderate so we're going to add a website instead where we cant see people's roblox usernames and will be rarely moderated as well


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
so


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
what's the point


[20-Apr-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
honestly


[20-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
just add a music bot so at least we can know who people's roblox usernames are lmao


[20-Apr-20 04:34 PM] emma;#1525
and we can see logs of who requests what songs bc we have delete logs in HR chats


[20-Apr-20 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; i will still test it out with Mr's to see how it goes


[20-Apr-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
ok if you can get your votes go ahead


[20-Apr-20 04:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; i just put a discord bot in my priv server


[20-Apr-20 04:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it has playlists


[20-Apr-20 04:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
im testing it out


[20-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
i think ethan's concern is people want to play their own music


[20-Apr-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
instead of listening to a preset playlist


[20-Apr-20 04:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but


[20-Apr-20 04:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then we might as well use the same music bot as the mrs?


[20-Apr-20 04:39 PM] emma;#1525
that's what i said lol i really dont see the point if the bot and the website function the same way, just the bot lets us know who's actually who and the website... doesn't....


[20-Apr-20 04:39 PM] emma;#1525
but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[20-Apr-20 04:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg


[20-Apr-20 04:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[20-Apr-20 04:42 PM] Cam#5887

[20-Apr-20 04:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
huh


[20-Apr-20 04:45 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; Since if we do it it will be a large server, offical site moderators will also moderatte it.


[20-Apr-20 04:46 PM] ethan;#0003
they moderate large servers


[20-Apr-20 04:46 PM] emma;#1525
but do they have the same rules as us


[20-Apr-20 04:46 PM] emma;#1525
I mean are we going to be keeping a "no cursing" rule on this website


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
bc i doubt the moderators care about cursing so much as more inappropriate things or offensive songs


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] ethan;#0003
they skip troll songs


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
ok but i ask again


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
are we gonna keep our "no cursing" rule


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
since it's a bloxton sponsored website


[20-Apr-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
so we probably should


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
someway you are able to give warnings


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
i saw in one channel


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
cursing is a kick from the disc server


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
they had a warning bot


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
except we don't know who's who so we can't even do that


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
ill test it out with the mrs later


[20-Apr-20 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
and see how it goes

[20-Apr-20 05:44 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk or u i guess


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
Wow


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
I wasn't referred to as BoD


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
Therefore I will not help you


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] emma;#1525
ur not in charge of the bot


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
Jk


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OMG I NEED TO GO VOTE


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah ask bonnie


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I want toy story


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] emma;#1525
bonnie isnt here


[20-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
He knows how to deal with it


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] emma;#1525
no he doesnt


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] emma;#1525
if he did it would be fixed by now


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Polk#1596
Oh


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah true


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] emma;#1525
hence why i want to try the age old trick of "turn if off and back on"


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Polk#1596
But I'd still get his permission


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Polk#1596
Since he tried to set it up


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] emma;#1525
him and minn were both on like 10 minutes ago


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] emma;#1525
smh


[20-Apr-20 05:46 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; im testing the music thing if you want to see it


[20-Apr-20 05:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey if im not mistaken I think polk already has sessions up at that time


[20-Apr-20 05:53 PM] ethan;#0003
The mr's seem to really enjoy tthe music website


[20-Apr-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
If anyone has sessions for that time cancel it


[20-Apr-20 05:54 PM] emma;#1525
stacey i thought only 16 people could join at once


[20-Apr-20 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
No


[20-Apr-20 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
On a public server


[20-Apr-20 05:54 PM] emma;#1525
does that really necessitate polk cancelling sessions he's had planned since before you had a movie planned haha


[20-Apr-20 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
You can have 20 moderators and up to 100 people watching


[20-Apr-20 05:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
-hosts- @stacey


[20-Apr-20 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
Well MRs might not go to the movie cause of it so


[20-Apr-20 05:55 PM] emma;#1525
ik but polk had his sessions up first


[20-Apr-20 05:55 PM] emma;#1525
and he's had them up for a long time too


[20-Apr-20 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
He can still host but can‚Äôt complain when a lot of MRs do the movie instead


[20-Apr-20 05:56 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; im glad the MRs like it but i still have many concerns and you still only have like 3 votes l


[20-Apr-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
if it ends up being approved can we keep it MR only for a week or so to see how much they even use it


[20-Apr-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
bc again if they dont use it for fun, they aren't going to be going on just to moderate it


[20-Apr-20 05:57 PM] ethan;#0003
they would use it if there where other people there to talk to


[20-Apr-20 05:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Has everyone saw that frappe got a tiktok


[20-Apr-20 06:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@emma; did it fix itself


[20-Apr-20 06:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
no


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming i havent done it


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
@emma; we already tried kicking and re adding ticket bot


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
bc stupid polky wolky didnt let me


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Didn't work


[20-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
fun


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
That's what the devs suggested too


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 btw the role for the ticket systems didnt even have speaking perms lol but that didnt fix the problem


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Rip


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Lol


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wonder if there's an alternative ticket bot


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
i mean it worked for HRs so i guess that wanst the problem in the first place


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey minn says he found one


[20-Apr-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
O


[20-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 permission to mess around with the bot settings since it is probably hopeless anyways


[20-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
and im bored


[20-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
also btw im using my alt to test it


[20-Apr-20 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure but don't make the server explode, but if you do maybe we can fire you so yay


[20-Apr-20 06:05 PM] emma;#1525
so if you see me giving a random person roles (not mr or HR roles just like verified)


[20-Apr-20 06:05 PM] emma;#1525
thats why


[20-Apr-20 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma has an alt exposed


[20-Apr-20 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
For the record I'd like to commend Emma for her patience

@katie


[21-Apr-20 07:47 AM] stacey#1000
He should‚Äôve replied to me. Maybe he‚Äôs immature about it and upset I sent him it.


[21-Apr-20 07:47 AM] stacey#1000

[21-Apr-20 07:53 AM] stacey#1000
He was inactive before this whole thing started....???


[21-Apr-20 07:54 AM] stacey#1000
And immature of him not to respond to me.


[21-Apr-20 08:23 AM] bman#0435
@Polk k, but i dont see why we should he required to only use that one template. as long as it displays the hosts of the secondary servers i think that should be enough, but ill use the template version


[21-Apr-20 08:43 AM] Polk#1596
its mainly because it looks way more organized if we had a standard template we all use

@katie wow please yell at Darren for being immature and not responding to Stacey about this


[21-Apr-20 11:49 AM] emma;#1525
also literally he had plenty of time to be talking on discord


[21-Apr-20 11:49 AM] emma;#1525
but not to go to a session? Hmm ok


[21-Apr-20 11:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think his reply was very good


[21-Apr-20 12:04 PM] bman#0435
doesnt he have to respond to stacey for it to count towards his notice letter


[21-Apr-20 12:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yes


[21-Apr-20 12:04 PM] bman#0435
oop


[21-Apr-20 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
Not necessarily


[21-Apr-20 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
But it would've been nice for him to respond to Stacey


[21-Apr-20 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
As long as hes given his excuse in some form then its fine


[21-Apr-20 12:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the problem is


[21-Apr-20 12:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's not really a valid one


[21-Apr-20 12:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
What's his excuse


[21-Apr-20 12:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's mostly about the pandemic


[21-Apr-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he talks about his studies for a bit but


[21-Apr-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
Does he have coronavirus


[21-Apr-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
doubt it


[21-Apr-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
Does his family have coronavirus or something


[21-Apr-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he didn't really talk about it so no


[21-Apr-20 12:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmm


[21-Apr-20 12:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well from my experience I'd recommend you give him 1-2 months to get his activity back in shape due to his reasoning before reassessing his case


[21-Apr-20 12:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i still think he should reply to stacey


[21-Apr-20 12:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
So do I


[21-Apr-20 12:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
But


[21-Apr-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
The point is hes replied, him not replying directly to stacey just shows hes immature and wont be getting shift anytime soon


[21-Apr-20 12:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like he has a chance lol


[21-Apr-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
He was lucky to get senior lmao


[21-Apr-20 12:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[21-Apr-20 01:54 PM] bman#0435
only the application


[21-Apr-20 01:54 PM] bman#0435
no formclosing date, no passer release date


[21-Apr-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe they're still selecting people


[21-Apr-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's no announcement about it sooooo


[21-Apr-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
ya but they should be more precise about dates and stuff lol


[21-Apr-20 02:27 PM] stacey#1000
Darren will still be fired. Sorry he can‚Äôt use this pandemic as an excuse when this whole thing when this was an issue before. He can‚Äôt just do 2 sessions for these 2 weeks to keep his rank then go back to doing absolutely nothing. If he doesn‚Äôt respond to me I‚Äôm taking that as he doesn‚Äôt care and he‚Äôs really immature. When this 2 weeks are done and if we still decide to demote him and anyone wants to they can.


[21-Apr-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Cause he‚Äôs legit doing this just so he can resign when he wants and be inactive as heck until then.


[21-Apr-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Funny he didn‚Äôt address that at all cause I did bring that up in his 2 week letter.


[21-Apr-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
@katie if you are talking to Darren flat out just bring up if he‚Äôs inactive and can‚Äôt supposedly do anything until July 31st when he ‚Äúresigns‚Äù why not just resign now instead of  being inactive until then and taking up an active senior spot for someone else


[21-Apr-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
Cause he‚Äôs legit still going to be demoted


[21-Apr-20 02:32 PM] bman#0435
ya like theres no point in him keeping his rank if he isnt doing anything


[21-Apr-20 02:32 PM] bman#0435
like i planned to resign on my birthday (then yall decided "lets promote bman!" and here i am) but i still worked lol


[21-Apr-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Like idc what his excuse is. He‚Äôs using the pandemic to his advantage, showing immaturity by not responding to me, and still is being selfish by being inactive until he resigns.


[21-Apr-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
All reasons to demote him.


[21-Apr-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
He low key shows attitude towards me now lmao


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
also


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
didnt he reply to katie about it?


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
he should have gone to u


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] bman#0435
katie, not stacey


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc u sent it


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
stacey sent the letter?


[21-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and he replied to katie which makes no sense


[21-Apr-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
He didn‚Äôt respond to me at all because he now is a child with an attitude with me not wanting to talk to me anymore because he‚Äôs mad


[21-Apr-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
I just want to demote him rn just for his attitude and selfishness alone but can‚Äôt


[21-Apr-20 02:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[21-Apr-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
She said she was back start of April then no. She keeps going inactive and deleting discord without keeping us updated which she can‚Äôt do.


[21-Apr-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
She has no excuse not to update her inactive notice.


[21-Apr-20 02:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
STACEY


[21-Apr-20 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve got concerns with her. I‚Äôll give her 24 hours to respond. And I‚Äôm not messaging her on Snapchat as if she deleted discord or is not on a lot on it, she should‚Äôve told us

cuff abuse, trolling, spamming, cursing, bypassing, probs more


[21-Apr-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
He had a chance once and showed he‚Äôs too immature to get another chance

[21-Apr-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
Yes no appeals ever


[21-Apr-20 03:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont think if his mom told him the stuff he said that he would curse like crazy


[21-Apr-20 03:16 PM] stacey#1000
Cookie you blacklisted and fired him and now you got to ban him from discord where he can never appeal from that again either üëè

[21-Apr-20 03:17 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe it‚Äôs like he secretly knew you were the one that blacklisted him and he decided to try to get revenge and it backfired


[21-Apr-20 03:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

only OGs will remember person299's admin commands, one of the first publically available admin systems


[21-Apr-20 11:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT


[21-Apr-20 11:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
ya it was a classic


[21-Apr-20 11:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
i used to use it


[21-Apr-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
```lua
Person299's admin command script is a command script created in 2008 by Person299. It was one of the first "admin commands" scripts and is now the most popular and known admin command script that has been created on Roblox. The command script has been republished countless times and is currently the most republished model on Roblox.
```


[21-Apr-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
Later, this happened


[21-Apr-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
```lua
Today, Kohltastrophe's admin script is more commonly used than Person299's.

[21-Apr-20 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760

However


[21-Apr-20 11:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
I dislike all admin systems for being so commanding as to forcefully make themselves a perm admin.


[21-Apr-20 11:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
kinda power hungry lol


[21-Apr-20 11:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
if your offering a free admin system you could at least do so with no strings attached


[21-Apr-20 11:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that's a thing?


[21-Apr-20 11:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I mean I love our admin but like even if we wanted to change we cant


[21-Apr-20 11:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

@RAMMGaming actually yes it is a thing


[21-Apr-20 11:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
but thats not my reason for wanting to change our admin system


[21-Apr-20 11:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
i want more flexibility


[21-Apr-20 11:57 PM] Beartikal#9760

[22-Apr-20 09:33 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs very new so I wouldn‚Äôt find this that major. She could‚Äôve been reporting something or asking a question, or like reading through hotel regulations again I sent her. If this is an occurrence that keeps happening then I will speak to her. She hasn‚Äôt even been an MR for 24 hours and she didn‚Äôt admin abuse so.


[22-Apr-20 09:33 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-Apr-20 09:33 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah it‚Äôs not major. That was legit her first shift on her who


[22-Apr-20 09:33 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-Apr-20 09:33 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-Apr-20 09:33 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-Apr-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000
Nothing will happen


[22-Apr-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah he might be trying to get her false fired because she got promoted


[22-Apr-20 09:34 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-Apr-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000
That happens a lot when new MRs get promoted


[22-Apr-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000

[22-Apr-20 01:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I could of sworn I saw molly at my sessions the other day unless we have two mollys


[22-Apr-20 01:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But there was definitely someone named molly lol


[22-Apr-20 01:09 PM] bman#0435
ya shes active


[22-Apr-20 01:09 PM] bman#0435
but she has a notice


[22-Apr-20 01:09 PM] bman#0435
with no end date


[22-Apr-20 01:10 PM] ethan;#0003
If she is active I don‚Äôt think we should worry about molly


[22-Apr-20 01:18 PM] bman#0435
then ill ask her if she wants the notice removed


[22-Apr-20 01:18 PM] bman#0435
either she will have the notice the right way or wont have the notice


[22-Apr-20 01:19 PM] bman#0435
shes had the notice for nearly a month now


[22-Apr-20 01:20 PM] bman#0435
it wouldnt hurt to ask her to change/delete it

[22-Apr-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
See I‚Äôve messaged Alex on discord but no response as I think she‚Äôs like gone inactive again without telling us she‚Äôs away from discord. And I know her Snapchat but legit I‚Äôm not going to message her on Snapchat for it. She should‚Äôve notified us and we should be able to contact her on discord


[22-Apr-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
What happened to Alex she used to be super active


[22-Apr-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
@Bloo_Berriez do i have ur perms to contact the mrs i listed (minus alex joey and ethan) to update their notices


[22-Apr-20 01:37 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs been inactive since like January


[22-Apr-20 01:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah @bman


[22-Apr-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
So how long is she on activity watch


[22-Apr-20 01:45 PM] bman#0435
Greetings USERNAME,

I am contacting you today to inform you that your inactive notice has been identified as invalid. With the most recent announcement in hand, we ask that you update your notice to include an ending date. If you are having complications doing so, you can always contact an HR or submit a new notice. This will give you the ability change the ending dates, reasoning, or the whole notice in general. Once again, I am asking that you update your notice as soon as possible. Thank you for your time!

[22-Apr-20 06:29 PM] emma;#1525

[22-Apr-20 06:33 PM] ethan;#0003

@ethan;


[22-Apr-20 07:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
we were told no so i mean we cant


[22-Apr-20 07:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
they dont change unless your group name was tagged or a mistake in the group title ,etc


[22-Apr-20 07:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
they dont change just to change like our case


[22-Apr-20 07:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont know their case


[22-Apr-20 07:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
but we cant we were told no


[22-Apr-20 07:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
unless the real hilton comes to us or something


[22-Apr-20 07:42 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[22-Apr-20 07:43 PM] bman#0435
i dont see why they let them change it and not us...


[22-Apr-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal i thought you said the whole reason we had to change "hilton" in the first place was bc of copyright issues...


[22-Apr-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
started by roblox... or hilton i dont remember


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] bman#0435
UM


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] bman#0435
@stacey @katie @a. ·É¶ WASNT MERVIN SUPPOSED TO BE BLACKLISTED?? OR...


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
if we changed from hilton to bloxton for no reason imma THROW HANDS


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
no we cant blacklist him


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's probably for the better


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
@bman apparently we suck at blacklisting bc i thought zippy was blacklisted but nope he's a good ol staff member


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
we only banned him from the discord


[22-Apr-20 07:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
saves us from strikes


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
not enough evidence to blacklist him


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
or any content deleted


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
however roblox handles it


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] bman#0435
he said he liked how katie had "off the shoulders" and wanted to "ride story"


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
trey we're still operating under "hilton hotels" technically lol


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] bman#0435
how-


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey ok that doesnt make a *ton* of sense


[22-Apr-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
if you could ban him from the server without the 9 total warnings but not blacklist...?


[22-Apr-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
if u want to blacklist him idc, but I was told before not to blacklist


[22-Apr-20 07:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
from what i know, he was uhh


[22-Apr-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
i mean, he should be blacklisted because he can pose as a threat to katie and story and whoever he talked nasty to/about...


[22-Apr-20 07:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
questionable with stacey and story in general discussion


[22-Apr-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
also, last time before i send the note to the invalid notice mrs

Greetings USERNAME,

Today I am contacting you to inform you that your inactive notice has been identified as invalid. With the most recent announcement in hand, we ask that you update your notice to include an ending date. If you are having complications doing so, you can always contact an HR or submit a new notice. This will give you the ability change the ending dates, reasoning, or the whole notice in general. Once again, I am asking that you update your notice as soon as possible. Thank you for your time!

[22-Apr-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma;


[22-Apr-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
we did it to AVOID copyright


[22-Apr-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
we wanted to be original


[22-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
theres no dignity in walking around saying you own the largest hotel group on roblox yet its called Hilton Hotels


[22-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
its best to be original


[22-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
so you can brand it, etc


[22-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
we were never copyrighted


[22-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
hence why they wont let us change the group name


[22-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
even so we changed it to Bloxton


[22-Apr-20 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal you should ask the owner of the other hilton that changed names and see what they did that got it changed


[22-Apr-20 08:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no fuck that group


[22-Apr-20 08:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
they are a bunch of pussys for stealing baby and bear's idea in the first place


[22-Apr-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal this all happened before i was an HR so what was my understanding is we were being actively copyrighted lol hence why everyone was confused when our actual name wasnt changed


[22-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
when a trainee randomly asks me if i like having a valk and they are sus :flushedbella:

[23-Apr-20 10:27 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

@bonnie591 ya ik but usually people have a question and so instead of them DMing me or opening a new ticket or just not asking id rather keep the ticket open for a day


[23-Apr-20 10:40 AM] emma;#1525
I‚Äôm good about checking my tickets and closing them after a day lol some of y‚Äôall keep them open for a week but I don‚Äôt typically do that

ye


[23-Apr-20 10:49 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think we needa rename them


[23-Apr-20 10:49 AM] Cooqkie#2809
bc it doesnt make sense


[23-Apr-20 10:49 AM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre all written down so


[23-Apr-20 10:55 AM] emma;#1525
I agree


[23-Apr-20 11:03 AM] Cooqkie#2809
what other things could we call them?


[23-Apr-20 11:09 AM] bman#0435
what if we just dont write down verbal warnings lol


[23-Apr-20 11:10 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but we gotta log the warnings so we know if they already got warned for it?


[23-Apr-20 11:10 AM] Cooqkie#2809
like so we can see if they need a verbal one or a written one


[23-Apr-20 11:10 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[23-Apr-20 11:10 AM] Cooqkie#2809

y dont bans count with tickets?


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] emma;#1525
bc bans... arent... tickets...?


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
nono


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like how tickets


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
count


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y dont bans count


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc i think theres more bans than tickets


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] emma;#1525
bc baby and bonnie said they dont want to count admin acts for now


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[23-Apr-20 01:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
bc they are hard to differentiate between


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
or track


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
or something


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
idk i feel like we should count bans but not suspensions/promos bc there are less of them so it doesnt really matter


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
but as long as we log what we do in the comments it would be easy to track


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
SO IDK


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i feel like bans should replace cohosting bc idk when any of rly do that


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] bman#0435
since when did we count promos-


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[23-Apr-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
i mean hopefully you didnt do enough promos to satisfy your admin act requirements with them lmao


[23-Apr-20 01:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we dont have admin acts anymore tho?


[23-Apr-20 01:09 PM] emma;#1525

[23-Apr-20 01:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[23-Apr-20 01:09 PM] bman#0435

@Cooqkie ok so for warnings being ‚Äúwritten‚Äù or ‚Äúverbal‚Äù what if we did like levels or tiers or warnings


[23-Apr-20 03:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok :D


[23-Apr-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
So tier 1 would be what our verbal warnings are now, minor offenses that we want to note down but overall don‚Äôt really affect their career

Tier 2 would be what written warnings are now, so stuff that‚Äôs more serious that could affect promo chances


[23-Apr-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
And if we need a tier 3 we can make one haha

@stacey Hi so I know you're doing your movie night at 2:00 pm EST, however SizzleBurger is going do be doing a joint public gamenight with us at 3:30 pm EST. Since your event is for MRs only and would surely be more than halfway through by the time the public event is starting, it shouldn't necessarily effect you too much, but just a heads up. Short notice ik but it'll be fun


[23-Apr-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
toy story 4 isnt too long of a movie so it should be fine


[23-Apr-20 05:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yay alright


[23-Apr-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
it might be like 10 mins left it

at 3:30


[23-Apr-20 05:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
Didn't want to turn them down when they asked cause it's not often we do joint alliance events


[23-Apr-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
yeah thats fine

@RAMMGaming honestly how dare you **attack** that person by nicely asking them not to say that phrase like oh my god you are such a horrible person for not ALLOWING them to continue bypassing

[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
i mean


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
we cant rly do claiming


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
since everyone hosts at different times


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
@katie So my whole 'guess' as to how hosting games went is that they're all gonna want to host in the first few weeks and then no one is going to host except for the occasional time


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
but we can limit how many people can do it like


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
weekly ig


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
hence why I didnt want to set up a "schedule" bc that was only gonna make people want to do it less


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
Maybe we can limit it to each senior gets to host 2 times a week maximum


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] katie#0200
yea


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
but tbh i see what hes saying


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] katie#0200
i agree with that


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
monday to sunday


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
bc we have what


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
megan especially has been hogging e.e


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
20 seniors


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
and imag


[23-Apr-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] bman#0435
imag has only hosted like 2


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
we could also add something on the senior board


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
bc i dont want to make a whole new board


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] bman#0435
ya ig it wouldnt hurt


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
basically "add a card with the time you claim" max a week in advance


[23-Apr-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
idk


[23-Apr-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
megan's only hosted 2 times


[23-Apr-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
so she's not the one hogging lol


[23-Apr-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
looks like omer and imag have hosted the most


[23-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
@katie so you approve something being added onto the senior board?


[23-Apr-20 09:21 PM] emma;#1525
bc if so i'll go ahead and do it


[23-Apr-20 09:22 PM] katie#0200
yes


[23-Apr-20 09:22 PM] emma;#1525

**IMPORTANT NOTICE** PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

Hello everyone, the Bloxton HR team has learned of several new scams/hacks circulating on Discord that could lead to your account being hacked. 

You may get a message asking you to download some type of file, whether it be a song from the Roblox website or your avatar. These users typically word it as if it's a favor for you or someone else, such as a free GFX or a song ID for a popular account/server (sometimes they will follow that up by asking you to copy and paste a code into your web browser.) These users can then steal your data and gain access to your account, even if you have 2-step authorization turned on in your settings. I have posted a few examples of these scam/hacks below.

**DO NOT OPEN ANY LINKS, VIDEOS, PICTURES IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THE USER!!!!** Don't interact with these users, instead contact an MR/HR **IMMEDIATELY** with the Discord tag and screenshots of what was sent to you.

Thank you all for your vigilance! Stay safe and stay home!



Signed,
RAMMGaming
General Management
Bloxton Hotels

[24-Apr-20 01:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563
As you know the next version has room customization, so that means hotel money has a way better purpose now. Staff would earn this by working, but what about guests who are not in the group?


[24-Apr-20 01:11 PM] Polk#1596
i assume one of the things is a statue of me


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Polk#1596

what cam said + money through doing activities or something?


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Cam#5887
yes yes


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Cam#5887
GAMES


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Plus a join bonus like we have now


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Polk#1596
maybe like by doing minigames


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
No if you give money for free the game has no purpose LOL


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Cam#5887
if u have an arcade


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Cam#5887
u may make


[24-Apr-20 01:12 PM] Cam#5887

sorry............ :(


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I was thinking what if the guests can also be employees, but they work different, smaller sub-jobs?


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
So it doesn't affect the real staff


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] Cam#5887
what jobs were you thinking?


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
like little objectives


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] Polk#1596
what about abuse


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Great idea


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] Polk#1596
it must be a very very small job if it isnt going to be abused


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Abuse?? They dont have admin they're players


[24-Apr-20 01:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Lol


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
not admin abuse


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
for example, security can cuff abuse


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
receptionists can give rooms to everyone


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
the guests aren‚Äôt gonna have cuffs lol


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Well security won't be a player role obvs


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
bartenders *can* give items to everyone


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
so what would that small job be


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Polk he is talking about non jobs


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like those are staff positions


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Baby is talking about new jobs


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
"I was thinking what if the guests can also be employees, but they work different, smaller sub-jobs?"


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't have any ideas based on that lol


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Reception will be changed to where the other player has to be nearby and willingly accept


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Maybe like you have to deliver food to different people? Wether it be poolside or outside rooms


[24-Apr-20 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
i just said those sub-jobs shouldnt be able to be abused in any way


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
as guests would be having them


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like room service almost


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait I just may have an idea for a new role


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
that would be sick


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
room service


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
that would be DOPEEEEEEEEEEEE


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So here's my concept


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
lifeguard


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ya it‚Äôs like pizza deliverer in pizza place


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
isnt room service basically housekeeping though


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
it would give them a bigger purpose


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
yeah but its food instead


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can basically have a chef right


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no more bartender


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Polk#1596
if they could deliver food


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
ye


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
facts


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Also, you know hoe sometimes staff are just sitting idle, what if they also serve NPC as well as people so that way they're always making in game money they can use?


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Hoe


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
How


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
WOAH BABY


[24-Apr-20 01:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
HAHAHAH


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LMAO


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
NO NEED TO THROW DISRESPECT LIKE THAT!

[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ya make them computers not guests


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that would make it easier


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] Cam#5887
yes we have a marching band that walks through le hotel


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You know what would make the new version interesting


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
OMG WAIT


[24-Apr-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WHAT ABOUT A BELL HOP


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
So basically staff serve NPC and real players so they're always working?!


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe have a role that makes food for the hotel


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
YOU HAVE TO DELIVER THE BAGS TO ROOMS


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Holy shit


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's actually a good idea


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Cam#5887
that would be cool..


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Cam#5887
damn


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Cam#5887
nice ramm


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait I can add on to that


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
So something I notice at Bloxton is guests tend to refer to the self check-in rather than going straight to the receptionist desk where there's receptionists on, now obviously removing self check-in wouldn't necessarily help because of the servers without receptionists, but what if there was a system where the self check-in only worked if there was no receptionists in the server?


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah i was thinking like bellhop and chef maybe for 'fake' roles


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
It'd attract more attention to the actual receptionist desk


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can have the delivery people lead to directions to the room


[24-Apr-20 01:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ya what about the spa too


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Similar to SB


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
we never have had a job there


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I‚Äôm sure there is something you could do there


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Maybe like a puzzle where you have to arrange hot stones


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
idk just a thought


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Hot stones? üòÇ


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
YES THE ROCKS YOU PUT ON SOMEONE AT THE SPA


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] Cam#5887
it'd be cool if bloxton becomes apart of an egg hunt one day


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Deaddd


[24-Apr-20 01:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
lifeguards! just a general thought for the pool, not sure how it'd be entertaining or anything but just an idea


[24-Apr-20 01:19 PM] babymariobebe#7563
"No RUNNING üò©"


[24-Apr-20 01:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
NO RUNNING UP THE SLIDES


[24-Apr-20 01:19 PM] babymariobebe#7563
GET OFF THE DOG AND STOP PRETENDING ITS A SEAHORSE


[24-Apr-20 01:19 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I was thinking that we could make Housekeeping a bit more interesting


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
what about going to the gym


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe having trash to their rooms


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and doing weight lifts like a gutiar hero game


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Also nezt version phones work


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Next


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] xM_inn#2821

[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Cam#5887
what phones, like V1 phones??


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
where you have to click when the dot gets to a certain point


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
i agree @xAfroTrey


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Phones can be used to call other players and order food yes


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Cam#5887
ooo


[24-Apr-20 01:20 PM] Cam#5887
thats **hot**


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
it would be cool if like after 5 minutes of a person checking in, the windows would get dirty and like the bed looks messed up etc


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
make an HR suite üòé


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
then housekeepers can do more than just roleplay


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
we can call room service 24/7


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] Cam#5887
YES PLEASE ADD AN HR ROOM


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yesss that would be a good idea polk


[24-Apr-20 01:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We said that already


[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
o


[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Dumb dumb mc dumb dumb


[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How about we add a drive thru


[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[24-Apr-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[24-Apr-20 01:28 PM] Polk#1596
i said that @RAMMGaming


[24-Apr-20 01:28 PM] Polk#1596
like instead of roleplay


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ye like you have to clean it


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
like koala


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
with the mops


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Polk#1596
we should rather get them to do actual stuff, interact with dirty windows and have an animation of you cleaning it


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Polk#1596
yeah thats what i had in mind as well


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Polk#1596
i was actually about to use that as an example


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Polk#1596
but i dont want random puddles in like the hotel


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Polk#1596
just in rooms


[24-Apr-20 01:29 PM] Cam#5887
i think koala cafe has dirt spots on the ground to clean


[24-Apr-20 01:30 PM] Cam#5887
pretty damn cool


[24-Apr-20 01:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ye and tables too


[24-Apr-20 01:30 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[24-Apr-20 01:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
how about groundkeeper


[24-Apr-20 01:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
you have to mow the lawn


[24-Apr-20 01:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
like in a mini game


[24-Apr-20 01:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
im still thinking about stuff for the spa


[24-Apr-20 01:32 PM] babymariobebe#7563
No even better, spills and stains to be cleaned only appear if you request a room clean, so even if you dont request a clean no harm done


[24-Apr-20 01:32 PM] babymariobebe#7563
And obviously housekeeping would get paid for it


[24-Apr-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
oo


[24-Apr-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
yes i like that idea


[24-Apr-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
as long as housekeepers have more things to do, im happy


[24-Apr-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
then people will maybe stop saying its a boring rank


[24-Apr-20 01:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's a good idea


[24-Apr-20 01:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
nice


[24-Apr-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
u should make it so housekeeping can put guests bags on their trolley and bring it up to their rooms


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
make it more interactive


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
even do it in empty rooms as well, like it was a previous guest. Gives people something to do in slow servers


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes bman we said bellhop


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
o ok


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
u should make the gym more interactive too


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
like u know robeats


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
something like that


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
idk


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL I SAID THAT TOO


[24-Apr-20 01:35 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
like survior


[24-Apr-20 01:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
on the pole game where you have to click the right circle at the right time

[24-Apr-20 07:41 PM] bman#0435
just a random thought lol


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] emma;#1525
@bman didn‚Äôt someone get warned for that once lol


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] emma;#1525
I wouldn‚Äôt personally just bc that‚Äôs borderline admin abuse


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
not sure


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] emma;#1525
and if we wouldn‚Äôt want seniors doing it then we shouldn‚Äôt do it


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] emma;#1525
that‚Äôs how I make choices üòÇ


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
was just asking because i was gonna do it as something for fun because of coronacation


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] emma;#1525
‚ÄúIf imag did this would I suspend her for it‚Äù


[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435

[24-Apr-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
like depending on the response i got


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that ain't a good idea lol


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's for sure


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
if you do it like at the end of the session so there‚Äôs not 50 people it‚Äôs prob ok


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
but I wouldn‚Äôt do it for the whole session personally, unless it‚Äôs a themed session


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
if its considered borderline admin abuse then im not risking it


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
lol


[24-Apr-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[24-Apr-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's hope she backs up her word


[24-Apr-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[24-Apr-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Greetings Sirmxj

I'm contacting you in regards to the Pastriez alliance request to Bloxton Hotels. After a long period of continuous High-Rank discussion about the possibilities of Pastriez becoming an alliance with Bloxton, we've made the decision to kindly decline your request. Our reasonings for this decision is as noted below.

Our first reasoning for making this decision is due to the fact that your company trainees are immediately able to begin working at the cash registers without any prior training, causing a lot of implications such as them not knowing certain items on the menu or not knowing how to use the cash register system which unfortunately effected some of our HR's visits. Our second reasoning for making this decision is due to the "Kitchen Leader" rank game pass which is sold for a very low price of 2,000 ROBUX and we personally aren't a big fan of the whole selling ranks idea due to the implications it can cause further down the line. Our third reasoning is due to the fact that a lot of activities are gamepass-locked which causes a disadvantage for the players with little to no ROBUX, and also due to the fact that there's a lot of gamepass advertisement posts cluttering the screen while at the cafe. While we fully understand Pastriez needs to make a fund income one way or another, we personally believe that making nearly all of the activities gamepass-restricted isn't very fair for others, but perhaps this method works well for your group and we do respect that.

[25-Apr-20 11:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
Now while there is also negatives, our HRs have some positives about your company which we'd like to mention. We liked the design of the cafe, the colours were very nice and we can see a lot of impressive development was put into the cafe. We also like how well you're group is doing in terms of group growth and events, we like how you host events a lot and engage with the community. Your company Middle-Ranks are very polite and welcoming and ensure moderation action is executed quickly and efficiently when it's necessary. We'd like to recommend Pastriez reapplies for an alliance in around 1-2 months if still interested in partnering with Bloxton Hotels.

I do ask that you're not offended by anything which I've stated within this letter as it's just our pure opinions and we hope you're able to understand and possibly take this as advice for the future. Bloxton would like to wish Pastriez all the best with it's future and if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate in responding to this letter.

Greetings JustAbadboy,

I'm contacting you in regards to the Grand Luxe Hotels alliance request to Bloxton Hotels. After a long period of continuous High-Rank discussion about the possibilities of Grand Luxe Hotels becoming an alliance with Bloxton, we've made the decision to kindly decline your request. Our reasonings for this decision is as noted below.

Our first reasoning for declining this request is due to the amount of ranks your group sells using game passes. We think it's very unprofessional to be selling MR ranks, especially at such low prices, due to the implications it would cause in regards to no official training and possible admin abuse. Our second reasoning for declining this request is due to the fact that your group game has copied models from a previous Bloxton/Hilton Hotels version which is in complete violation of ROBLOX Terms of Service and our regulations too. Our third and final reasoning is due to the fact that your company trainees are able to immediately begin working as receptionists if they pass their quiz/interview which isn't very good since they would have no prior training and it causes implications such as trainees not knowing how to properly serve people or how to use any of the operating systems.

I do ask that you're not offended by anything which I've stated within this letter as it's just our pure opinions and we hope you're able to understand and possibly take this as advice for the future. Bloxton would like to wish Grand Luxe Hotels all the best with it's future and if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate in responding to this letter.

[25-Apr-20 12:31 PM] bman#0435
@xM_inn so its basically a campfire minus the campfire


[25-Apr-20 12:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
kinda


[25-Apr-20 12:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
it isnt cheap!!!


[25-Apr-20 12:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@xM_inn what do you think about venti for an ally when they get their footing again?


[25-Apr-20 12:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
yesss


[25-Apr-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't mind seeing them


[25-Apr-20 12:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
we were going to begin discussing them right before they got hacked


[25-Apr-20 12:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
they got all their funds back which is good


[25-Apr-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They seem like a good group


[25-Apr-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
Ok does anyone want to make an announcement to our MRs about what I brought up. Apparently many of them do info at the hotel and kick people with an account age of 0. If no I else wants to I will later


[25-Apr-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
I just don‚Äôt have time to right now


[25-Apr-20 01:44 PM] bman#0435
i can later


[25-Apr-20 01:45 PM] bman#0435
since i made the cb doc and i guess its solely around that topic


[25-Apr-20 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
the sooner it‚Äôs announced the better


[25-Apr-20 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
Because people will start getting real consequences for falsely kicking people


[25-Apr-20 01:45 PM] bman#0435
ok nvm LOL


[25-Apr-20 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôll make one up quickly


[25-Apr-20 01:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'd suggest you do an announcement first and then begin warning anyone who continues **after the announcement**


[25-Apr-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Yes that‚Äôs the plan but like have you noticed this before at the hotel


[25-Apr-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
did we make like a set amount of how many accounts banned would make them a cb


[25-Apr-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
i was thinking like 3-5 accounts banned but idk if we have an official number


[25-Apr-20 01:59 PM] katie#0200
thing is like


[25-Apr-20 01:59 PM] katie#0200
im losing track of who is a cb and who isnt anymore


[25-Apr-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
katie i made a list-


[25-Apr-20 01:59 PM] katie#0200
ik but like


[25-Apr-20 02:00 PM] katie#0200
sometimes theres a new one that hasnt been added and then they want me to ban and im like idk who this is


[25-Apr-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
u can check reports or mb


[25-Apr-20 02:02 PM] katie#0200
yea i mean like the ones with random usernames - a staff member then claims its a cb that i havent heard of before plus i cant prove theyre that specific cb


[25-Apr-20 02:02 PM] katie#0200
if u know what i mean


[25-Apr-20 02:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
a CB is a person who circumvents their ban


[25-Apr-20 02:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
so its 1 banned account


[25-Apr-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
Ok thoughts

Dealing with CBs at the Hotel

Greetings, MRs 

It has been brought the the HR teams attention that many of you have been misinterpreting who is a CB at the hotel and falsely kicking people who you believe is a CB. We understand CBs can become frustrating and at times and can be hard to predict who is really a CB. That is why we have the CB list for you created by Bman. This CB list was created to help you pin point who is a CB and who is not. You should be using this while you are at the hotel and not just guessing who is a CB and who is not. 
If you believe someone is a CB, but don‚Äôt know for sure and just guess, kicking them over and over for being a CB, when in reality they mat not be a CB at all, that is admin abuse.  You also can NEVER kick people based on their account ages at the hotel. It doesn‚Äôt matter if their account age is less than 10, that doesn‚Äôt always mean they are a CB and you cannot kick them based on it. Kicking people based on account ages at the hotel is another form of admin abuse. If you are ever unsure if they are a CB, use the CB list to your advantage and check it, it‚Äôs pinned in this channel. If you are still unsure you may ask another MR in staff-discussion or DM an HR. 
Going forward, please don‚Äôt be guessing who is a CB and kicking them based on it. Remember to be using the CB list and not be afraid to ask for help if you are unsure of who is a CB or not. The CB list was made for MRs+ to benefit you while you‚Äôre on a shift at the hotel, as we understand CBs can become frustrating. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this announcement please message any member of the HR team.

staceyzn

[25-Apr-20 02:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[25-Apr-20 02:37 PM] Cam#5887
thats what i was thinking


[25-Apr-20 02:38 PM] Cam#5887
there is no proof of them saying "losers"


[25-Apr-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
did kenzi receive the report or was kenzi with them


[25-Apr-20 02:39 PM] Cam#5887
not sure, want me to DM Kenzi asking?


[25-Apr-20 02:40 PM] Cam#5887
but like i said, nothing on the cards give out that they were trolling


[25-Apr-20 02:40 PM] Cam#5887
they were simply telling the staff member that they were allowed to be there


[25-Apr-20 02:40 PM] Cam#5887
in which they are


[25-Apr-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so going forward if any mr falsely kicks people for being a CB or kicking off of acc ages they will get warned or suspended


[25-Apr-20 02:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait wha


[25-Apr-20 02:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809

told they werent allowed to be doing an "alliance visit" as LRs


[25-Apr-20 02:42 PM] Cam#5887
without MR/HR supervision


[25-Apr-20 02:42 PM] Cam#5887
which is wrong


[25-Apr-20 02:42 PM] Cam#5887
they are allowed to visit alliances


[25-Apr-20 02:42 PM] Cam#5887
and, there is legit no issue in taking a picture with the alliance


[25-Apr-20 02:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lmao that‚Äôs so dumb if there‚Äôs no evidence of them doing anything


[25-Apr-20 02:43 PM] Cam#5887

[25-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
k


[25-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887
because that proof


[25-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887
was


[25-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887
false


[25-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it wasnt even proof


[25-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Cam#5887
ikr


[25-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Cam#5887
it was them stating


[25-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Cam#5887
they were allowed to be there


[25-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Cam#5887
in which, they are


[25-Apr-20 02:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[25-Apr-20 03:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[25-Apr-20 03:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they


[25-Apr-20 03:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
legit see someone 2-3 times


[25-Apr-20 03:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and think theyre a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] emma;#1525
I think we're way too general with who we call a "cb"


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
ya thats why we need to set a number that would deem them as like an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù cb or one that would be added to the list


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
min said whoever is banned and comes back is a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
but thats just


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] emma;#1525
Like the term CB didn't start until kaylee and sadder came around bc they made literally hundreds of accounts


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
like


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
wayyyy to many people


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] emma;#1525
Okay well we can't ban every single person that CBs


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
ya


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] emma;#1525
and we also can't get proof lol


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
i was thinking like 3-5 accounts


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
probs like


[25-Apr-20 03:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
5-10


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
accounts


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or more


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
3 isnt enough


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
thats a lot-


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
ok


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
ill


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
make an announcement


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc then theyd be banned


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
for


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
major trolling


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] emma;#1525
Y'all how are we gonna track that lmao


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre just


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] emma;#1525
IMO we don't need to worry about CBs unless they're making it as personal as swan, kaylee, sadder, etc did


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
announcing someone as a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
without asking us


[25-Apr-20 03:05 PM] emma;#1525
Bc we can't track it unless they get that personal with us


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think they need to get it approved if they want someone to be known as a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] emma;#1525
If some random 13 year old makes 10 accounts and trolls on them we litearlly won't know its the same person unless the usernames are all basically the same


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i mean


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we could just get rid of cbs


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cam#5887
how so?


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they keep coming bc we keep banning


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so if they dont get banned


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they wont come


[25-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc its not as interesting


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
but what if they keep doing a major offense?


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
then we have to ban


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then we can ban for that


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
I HOPE THOSE MFS GET IP BANNED


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but saying cb is 2 common now


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
i would pay roblox to ip ban


[25-Apr-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[25-Apr-20 03:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
im pretty sure


[25-Apr-20 03:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
cbs just come bc theyre bored and have nothing else to do


[25-Apr-20 03:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so if we stop banning them


[25-Apr-20 03:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and make what theyre doing boring


[25-Apr-20 03:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre just gonna stop coming bc its not ending their bordem


[25-Apr-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
@emma; all the major cbs use the same name for their accounts lol


[25-Apr-20 03:09 PM] emma;#1525
yeah the MAJOR ones


[25-Apr-20 03:09 PM] emma;#1525
but people are trying to kick anyone and everyone for being a CB


[25-Apr-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
and im not talking about that. im talking about how many times a user has to be banned to be added to the list and etc


[25-Apr-20 03:09 PM] emma;#1525
even the not major ones


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; what if we just got rid of the cb thing


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oooof


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so no ones a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't love the idea


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we got rid of it last time and it worked out horribly


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435
the point of staceys announcement is to tell them to be more aware of who theyre kicking


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's basically a lose lose situation until they stop cookie


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre kicking anyone they think is a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
without knowing


[25-Apr-20 03:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] emma;#1525
Just tell them they're only allowed to kick people on Bman's list for being a CB


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
mine is abt tracking the wmount of times they got banned to be added to the list/considered as a cb


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] emma;#1525
and if they think someone else needs to be considered a CB they need to submit their name to us


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] emma;#1525
I don't think we need to have a concrete line of CB vs not CB, we can decide on an individual basis


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so what exactly should be the number for them to be considered a CB


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i usually go with 3 accounts


[25-Apr-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
thats what im asking lol


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kind of like the 3 strike system


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
3 isnt that much though


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
that was what my message was abt


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
but emma changed it to be abt usernames


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what do you guys personally think


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
more than 3


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
i said 3-5 but cookie says 5-10


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that doesn't sound like a good idea


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
hence why i wanted more opinions to conduct a poll


[25-Apr-20 03:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because they can still sneak in with different usernames


[25-Apr-20 03:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and do that "HAIL SOOTY" bullshit lol


[25-Apr-20 03:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then again


[25-Apr-20 03:13 PM] emma;#1525
@bman I didnt change it to be about usernames, I said we can't track every person who could be classified as a CB, only the ones *with* similar usernames for each alt


[25-Apr-20 03:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can ban them for major offenses


[25-Apr-20 03:13 PM] emma;#1525
Which I think is something we need to take into account


[25-Apr-20 03:13 PM] emma;#1525
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[25-Apr-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435

I mean like


[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's their fault lol


[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] bman#0435

[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Meme included him into the fired list üò≠


[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] emma;#1525
i think drew is friends with swan and sadder


[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] bman#0435
meme included everyone


[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] bman#0435
lol


[25-Apr-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I ain't mad at that lmao


[25-Apr-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
i dont have an issue of him being friends with swan and sadder


[25-Apr-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
but i dont see y he tryna get involved in their drams


[25-Apr-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
drama


[25-Apr-20 03:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think both of them might have a pretty good shot considering their circumstances


[25-Apr-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[25-Apr-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
that's his choice


[25-Apr-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even tho I reported Swan, she at least stuck to her word (for now at least)


[25-Apr-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
i mean I have no intention of appealing swan and sadder


[25-Apr-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sadder is basically like


[25-Apr-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
but they've chilled a lot now


[25-Apr-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Yeah I'm done lol"


[25-Apr-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
and i dont hate either of them


[25-Apr-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525
idc if MRs are friends with them anymore bc i do think they actually changed for the better


[25-Apr-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525
and have 0 interest in us anymore


[25-Apr-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525
thankfully


[25-Apr-20 03:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Last time I declined them right away but now


[25-Apr-20 03:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think I'll give them the benefit of a doubt


[25-Apr-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they seem a lot better


[25-Apr-20 03:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have no issues nowadays

it's Gumdroxps^^


[25-Apr-20 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
What they said was


[25-Apr-20 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
"For starters, there are several groups that have been allowing Trainee's to work in their establishment like Koala Cafe, Soro's Restaurant Franchise, etc. I do understand that it may be difficult, but at the same time, it's because we're attempting to purposefully allow the younger kids on the platform to enjoy a game unlike the groups that would prevent them. Although I am extremely disheartened you had a bad visit due to that, you have to take into account how our group runs overall. In addition to the gamepass for Kitchen Leader, several groups sell ranks like Koala Cafe, SizzbleBurger, etc. Concluding my statement, you said a lot of our areas are gamepass restrictive. The only areas that are gamepasses restrictive are the jetski area and the upstairs dining. Besides that, we have the Ferris Wheel, Spa, Pirate Obby, DIY Kitchen, Staff Lounge, Lighthouse, Pool, etc, so I don't really understand how most of our areas are gamepass restrictive. Like I completely respect Hilton Hotels and all, but do you get what I'm attempintng to state?"

honor member


[25-Apr-20 07:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its given to former hrs i dont remember why she never got it


[25-Apr-20 07:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
maybe it was because she quit with drama thats why


[25-Apr-20 07:39 PM] bman#0435
not sure either


[25-Apr-20 07:39 PM] bman#0435
ik bekah got hers taken since she came back as a manager


[25-Apr-20 07:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she got it taken @Beartikal


[25-Apr-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so let me explain


[25-Apr-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the reason she got it taken because she was constantly causing a lot of issues towards the group


[25-Apr-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she was trolling as a security several times


[25-Apr-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she pestered ryan quite often so that's fun


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and plus she leaked 3 boards


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know that it's 3 years ago but that ain't honorary lmao


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
ya so basically she quit with drama


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
plus i don't like how she's constantly tagging bloo for it either


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she doesn't deserve it to me


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
sorry chief


[25-Apr-20 07:43 PM] bman#0435
what abt bekah


[25-Apr-20 07:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't mind bekah


[25-Apr-20 07:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
shes much long forgiven herself b y now she apologized and everything which is definitely sincere because its been 3 years and she probably knew it wasn't right but yeah idk about giving it back though


[25-Apr-20 07:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
naw i don't think she deserves it back


[25-Apr-20 07:44 PM] bman#0435
she said the only way shed come back to bloxton is if we promtoed her to hr


[25-Apr-20 07:44 PM] bman#0435
then she begged bloo to rank her

[25-Apr-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525
I mean giving a known troller a free rank to cause issues at a hotel is not something I'd ever personally do


[25-Apr-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525
And had I been an HR when you did it you know you'd be hearing me bitch at you for a long time

[25-Apr-20 11:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this isn't suspension worthy


[25-Apr-20 11:46 PM] Cam#5887

[25-Apr-20 11:46 PM] Cam#5887

[25-Apr-20 11:55 PM] bman#0435

[25-Apr-20 11:55 PM] bman#0435

[26-Apr-20 01:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You know what would make weather conditions better


[26-Apr-20 01:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You guys should add a sunset sequence


[26-Apr-20 01:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe find a way to make the skybox pink


[26-Apr-20 01:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Kind of like this

[26-Apr-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
then I searched her username and saw she was perm denied LOL


[26-Apr-20 01:35 AM] bman#0435
y is she undervinvestigatikn


[26-Apr-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
i put it there temp


[26-Apr-20 01:35 AM] bman#0435
o ok


[26-Apr-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
while i was searching her


[26-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
then i comment shes perm denied


[26-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
then archived it


[26-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
no thanks to her app


[26-Apr-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
has she even tried appealing


[26-Apr-20 01:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She can't


[26-Apr-20 01:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like she got fired quite a number of times and leaked 2 separate boards


[26-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
yeah i saw that


[26-Apr-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
i searched her username


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
and yikes


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
bye bye to that app


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Joud and I gave the info and she was out


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
ik she cant appeal but like has she ever asked lmao


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not that I know of


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
im surprised she even sent in an app when shes banned


[26-Apr-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well uh


[26-Apr-20 01:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
We only do two games lol


[26-Apr-20 01:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't see the point in bringing her back


[26-Apr-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
but like shes gotta know shes blacklisted at this point


[26-Apr-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
so like why is she even trying to get through apps


[26-Apr-20 01:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She kind of pestered bloo for the honor member role which I really don't like


[26-Apr-20 01:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have a problem with it because she kind of ignored all the crap she put us through lol


[26-Apr-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
like i had no idea who she was legit then saw her username sounded a bit familiar so i searched it on trello and sent the app out the window


[26-Apr-20 01:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Plus I don't like how conceited she was acting with her comments


[26-Apr-20 01:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nothing disturbing or causing drama but like


[26-Apr-20 01:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think she deserves it


[26-Apr-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
so she was fired from rank 14?


[26-Apr-20 01:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't hate her but she isn't really honorary at all


[26-Apr-20 01:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
No she was fired as an LR


[26-Apr-20 01:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She was brought back quite a number of times since there was zero control in the HR Team and still fucked up


[26-Apr-20 01:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I sound like I'm still cancelling her but I don't think she's going to have much longevity


[26-Apr-20 01:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think the former role is all she needs


[26-Apr-20 01:44 AM] stacey#1000
oh she has former MR role


[26-Apr-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
i mean I saw the things she did was like 2-3 years ago but it was still pretty bad


[26-Apr-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The thing is


[26-Apr-20 01:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The point of the honor member role is to maintain stability all the way through with your behavior


[26-Apr-20 01:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm still have glimpses of her not really doing so hot


[26-Apr-20 01:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nothing awful or that serious, but she's not really honor material


[26-Apr-20 01:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also let's compare her to other members


[26-Apr-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
she also shouldnt be begging for the role


[26-Apr-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
that says something


[26-Apr-20 01:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah exactly


[26-Apr-20 01:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
You don't see people like Liana and Horse doing those type of actions


[26-Apr-20 01:51 AM] stacey#1000
and it seems like shes not trying to own up to her actions from the past and thinks she can get a job again that easily without even apologizing


[26-Apr-20 01:51 AM] stacey#1000
not how it works


[26-Apr-20 01:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They have a concept of their own behavior and had a blueprint from beginning to end


[26-Apr-20 01:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mallory didn't do that and that's why I think it's better to not give her the role


[26-Apr-20 01:53 AM] stacey#1000
yeah I agree


[26-Apr-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
if she applies at the application centre again ill throw her app out the window again

I wish we could call them out but we have no idea what their intentions are


[26-Apr-20 10:19 AM] xM_inn#2821

[26-Apr-20 10:19 AM] xM_inn#2821

[26-Apr-20 10:45 AM] stacey#1000
Wowww


[26-Apr-20 11:11 AM] Cam#5887
Has there ever been a rule that MRs are allowed to kick LRs with the reason "Server hop"? Or am I just blind


[26-Apr-20 11:27 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@xM_inn what about the mr only ones


[26-Apr-20 11:27 AM] Cooqkie#2809
for the shift


[26-Apr-20 11:27 AM] Cooqkie#2809
lrs r def gonna come


[26-Apr-20 11:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
MRs will be told of their events in #staff-announcements


[26-Apr-20 11:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
on the public board, MR events are listed as classified


[26-Apr-20 11:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[26-Apr-20 11:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
so nobody will know the actual MR events unless they're leaked


[26-Apr-20 11:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so should we be able to see them


[26-Apr-20 11:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
from the link u sent


[26-Apr-20 11:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[26-Apr-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
i just think having a temporary trello board to store the event timings will be handy


[26-Apr-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
rather than a long announcement


[26-Apr-20 11:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
and expecting people to remember


[26-Apr-20 11:29 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[26-Apr-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we good i maybe kinda made her make a new one

[26-Apr-20 02:42 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie does she fail people for saying ‚Äúhotel‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhotels‚Äù


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
Bc that‚Äôs literally a trick then


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
since the word she gives them is ‚Äúhotel‚Äù


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
you should ask her


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
2 years and she‚Äôs been doing that??


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[26-Apr-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont think shes using it anymore


[26-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
she said she would try the new one (which looks ok)


[26-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and if more ppl fail than pass then she'll make a new one


[26-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but like


[26-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if u know 6 people normally pass


[26-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and only 6


[26-Apr-20 02:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u would think she'd notice something was wrong


[26-Apr-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bruh i think amiee might be back @bman


[26-Apr-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[26-Apr-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@bman


[26-Apr-20 03:37 PM] bman#0435
nope


[26-Apr-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why can't she be like swan or sadder


[26-Apr-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
because shes attention seeking


[26-Apr-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
also


[26-Apr-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
didnt we suspect bearvish of being cuffmedad but never drew a conclusion to who they actually are?


[26-Apr-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my best bet is an attention seeking person also


[26-Apr-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
or did we draw a conclusion


[26-Apr-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we drew a conclusion it wasn't him


[26-Apr-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
ya well who was ir


[26-Apr-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
it


[26-Apr-20 03:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no idea but it certainly wasn't bear

tresni said he was an mr at the same time


[26-Apr-20 03:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im going to take that info with a grain of salt


[26-Apr-20 03:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if she knew, she would've been reported it


[26-Apr-20 03:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's just me though


[26-Apr-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my best guess is that she's believing a claim w/o evidence and she got gullible over it


[26-Apr-20 03:44 PM] Cam#5887
ok i think my pc is broken


[26-Apr-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@bman @stacey @ethan; if you see kyle at any of ur remaining sessions spam tag me


[26-Apr-20 04:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
also i need a plan, what should i do


[26-Apr-20 04:44 PM] emma;#1525
bloo you know what would be ICONIC


[26-Apr-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[26-Apr-20 04:44 PM] emma;#1525
if we played TDI and like rigged it so kyle could win


[26-Apr-20 04:44 PM] emma;#1525
and then you promote him after he wins LOL


[26-Apr-20 04:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OMG LOL


[26-Apr-20 04:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
should we? but what about everyone else. u best know they about to vote him out anyways


[26-Apr-20 04:47 PM] emma;#1525
we'd have to get a few people in on it


[26-Apr-20 04:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
unless we get like, me you stacey ethan, trey, bman not to make it sus since we've all played together and that should hopefully work if were not all on the same team lmao


[26-Apr-20 04:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that would be funny though, having him win lmao and then being like UR ALSO GETTING PROMOTED


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
if you think it would work, then you should tag hr announcements and ask who'd be willing to help


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
i know ethan will bc hes obsessed with TDI LOL


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
We would need enough of us to vote out everyone else and not Kyle


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Also finding out who Kyle is


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
stacey if you got like megan, blaire, etc to go

[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
On the game


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
without them needing to know that we're saving kyle


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause ik some of u guys have a session in liek 2 hours and TDI at least takes an hour


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
the hard part is figuring out who kyle is


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
bc he likes to lie


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
LOL


[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Apr-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[26-Apr-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so should I cancel my session?


[26-Apr-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Apr-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
he could announce it on the disc server in staff announcements


[26-Apr-20 05:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

@Bloo_Berriez kyle will defo be in the VC so if you're willing to talk you can do it over VC


[26-Apr-20 05:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if ur willing too @stacey


[26-Apr-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
or if you don't want to, then I'd say announce it in staff lounge


[26-Apr-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
I am yeah


[26-Apr-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525

[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435
didnt we do that before


[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435
because we thougjt it was bloo


[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435
but it was him


[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok well ima announce gamenight for 5pm pst / 8 pm est


[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435

[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435
idk


[26-Apr-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
for this to work we'll have to tell each other who we are


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
so that we don't vote each other out


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
i say as if i can even go


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
Someone get rid of my training card pls


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
but my point stil stands


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
ok stacey


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
ok im ezekiel i already know it


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
ya


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
its just


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
meant to be


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez if you do it at 9 pm est i can maybe go ;((((((


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
but if 8 works out better for you do that haha


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
obvs you and kyle are the priority


[26-Apr-20 05:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if u want sure


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but i hope kyle


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
What if it doesn‚Äôt go as planned


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmm


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
Cause Kyle could still get voted out


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
if kyle doesnt even show up thats a big rip


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
so this all rests on kyle A) going and B) telling bloo who he is


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ill ask kyle and be like "Wanna play TDI later?! I'ma host it!!"


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
ok yeah do that


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
figure out if he can even go first


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and he will be like "sure!!" (hopefully)


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
and if he cant


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
Emma we need you to go for vote


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
then we can put stacey and bman's sessions back up üòÇ


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
stacey my family has plans


[26-Apr-20 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok let me ask


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
and idk when we'll be done


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
bc we're going somewhere after dinner, for prob like an hour


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
and if we dont eat until  7 est then i wont make it at 8


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] bman#0435
somes mrs r gonna be ignorant and not tell us who they r


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] bman#0435
or say theyre someone else


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] bman#0435
so


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
we dont need to know who the MRs are


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
bc if we have like


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
6 HRs going


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
that's hopefully 3 per team


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
I got Megan to go


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
I will tell her who to vote


[26-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
which with megan teaming with stacey and bloo teaming with kyle


[26-Apr-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
means that we should have voting power each round


[26-Apr-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
HOPEFULLY


[26-Apr-20 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
I will get maya and blaire to go too

Greetings Managers!

I am here to inform you that **bubble chats** for staff reports should no longer be accepted. Complications such as no requirement to use grammar in whisper chats and possible photoshopping can occur through chat bubbles. The chatbox is the most efficient and reliable source we can use in order to pick out staff who don't use grammar to their best abilities. From now on, please only accept chatbox proof and decline bubble chat proof. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to an HR!

@bman should i be a bit petty and say "If you understand why he is ineligible, why are you recommending him again?"


[27-Apr-20 07:20 PM] bman#0435
i dont think cory even edited the original saying


[27-Apr-20 07:20 PM] bman#0435
NO WONDER OLIVIA WANTED HIM PROMOTED, THEYRE BEST FRIENDS üíÄ


[27-Apr-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Apr-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
lol


[27-Apr-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
i highly doubt he read the promo card


[27-Apr-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm tempted to say something about him fishing and pestering for head


[27-Apr-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
and just saw "omarzarur" and unarchived it


[27-Apr-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435

[27-Apr-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
idc if its too harsh or too lighthearted (its omar lol) but we supposed to be saying the truth on this, not agree with eevrything everyone else says


[27-Apr-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
ya it really annoys me when all i see on a card is one person who says something and everyone else goes "what they said"


[27-Apr-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
like there's no way 20 of you have the EXACT same opinions as one person


[27-Apr-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
honestly can we tell the seniors that if they are commenting on promo suggestions they need to write their OWN reasoning instead of saying "I agree with XYZ."


[27-Apr-20 07:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oof i was going to say he fishes way too often for a promo


[27-Apr-20 07:24 PM] bman#0435

[27-Apr-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
wth happened to mirk


[27-Apr-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
he became so immature


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did he do something


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
hes just being so immature


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
for many reason


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also idk if he's mature ever


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
ill explain all


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
there was far too many things at my session


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
so 1


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Are we going to vote on it


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435

[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like is he going to face a sus-


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
O


[27-Apr-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
not worthy enough for a vote


[27-Apr-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll let u explain


[27-Apr-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then I'll judge


[27-Apr-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When u said immature, I was thinking vacron type of immature


[27-Apr-20 08:55 PM] bman#0435
well the thing is i dont rly have proof of it because its like stuff u either wouldnt expect him to do or stuff that was just annoying people


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
ok so


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
@stacey u can read this too if u want since u joined the server


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
so


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
1)


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
apparently slock broke and i asked kami to slock for me


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
so she did


[27-Apr-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
and she said others were joining


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000
so u want me to see if slock works for me?


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
so mirk saw others joining and decided to say stuff like "Be our guest! Welcome to Mirk's server once again! <3"


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
maybe


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
gimme like


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
1 min to explain what mirk did


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000
btw why are you playing boring music at your session


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
so i just ignored that


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
IM PLAYING MINECRAFT MUSIC LOL


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
ok


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
so


[27-Apr-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
then


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
i do my intro


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
i tp myself into the tc


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
he starts to run towards the door


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and hes trying to get in when its closed


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and so other people see it


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and they join in


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and i said idk why people are getting up


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and he still tried getting in


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
after everyon had sat down


[27-Apr-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
and i knew it was mirk because 1) he was the only one with wings on


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
and 2) people in chat were telling him to sit


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
then


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
while kami was naming


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
2 people were trying to take a photo together


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds like a suspension given the context


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
and mirk kept "photobombing" it every single time


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] stacey#1000
did you speak to him at all or no?


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
and one told him he was being annoying


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
no because my dad was yelling at me to help my dog lol


[27-Apr-20 08:59 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if he wasnt following your directions


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
so like right after i released staff i had to go afk


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
he deserves a warning for sure


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
well thats the issue


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
but like


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
its not that he wasnt following my firections


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
directions


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
he shouldve known better


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
since i dont have directions like u cant run into the door when i tp myself or that u cant photobomp other potos


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
lol


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The way ur describing it pisses me off


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
no but like


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
he was just annoying others and was being self-centered and immature


[27-Apr-20 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
when u told people to sit down


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
did he not listen to that?


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds a lot like OBC @bman


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
thats not following your directions


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
and its like one of those things that happen but you cant get proof of it because its all unexpected


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
nope


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
he didnt


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
so there u go


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
i couldsee his wings through the door


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
he failed to follow directions


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
try speaking to him about it


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
and if he lies


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
ya but i dont have proof of it other than the h message in logs and the chatlogs of people screaming "mirk"


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
suspend


[27-Apr-20 09:01 PM] stacey#1000
o


[27-Apr-20 09:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[27-Apr-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
can you explain why you failed to follow directions and were being immature prior to/during the session?


[27-Apr-20 09:06 PM] bman#0435
@stacey @xAfroTrey


[27-Apr-20 09:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I would ask that


[27-Apr-20 09:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's straightforward and to the point


[27-Apr-20 09:08 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[27-Apr-20 09:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@bman


[27-Apr-20 09:08 PM] bman#0435
k


[27-Apr-20 09:09 PM] bman#0435
he said "Immature? Oh! If I was apologies!"


[27-Apr-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
i-


[27-Apr-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
imm respond with this


[27-Apr-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
Yeah. From what I have observed, you claimed this server as your own and welcomed staff who should have been kicked from the slock into the server. You also failed to follow my directions in sitting back down after you and many other people decided to charge at the door when it was not opened. To end off, you continuously "photobombed" staff members' photos after they told you to stop many times.


[27-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey @stacey


[27-Apr-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[27-Apr-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
is that good


[27-Apr-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
yes

You could tell him you're gonna discuss it more once the session ends


[27-Apr-20 09:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Another option is to forgive but not really forget


[27-Apr-20 09:20 PM] stacey#1000

Considering how long you've been an MR and the number of times we've mentioned the importance of maturity at sessions, you should've known better. Remember you set an example for the LRs as they observe your behaviour, like how they all got up to crowd the door to try and get inside as you were doing. You need to set a good example for LRs, by following directions, and not purposely trying to annoy others by photo bombing. This is an official warning, if this kind of behaviour continues keep in mind further consequences can occur. Remember this for any time you attend a session or do a shift, maturity is important.


[27-Apr-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
That gets straight to the point, but something like that.


[27-Apr-20 09:25 PM] bman#0435

[27-Apr-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
yea

You can still have fun at sessions and shifts, but remember to keep it at a professional level.


[27-Apr-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Apr-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
wait is this gonna be written or verbal


[27-Apr-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435

ye


[27-Apr-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
so send him that then post it in warnings


[27-Apr-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
its a warning no matter if its written or verba;


[27-Apr-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
verbal*


[27-Apr-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
honestly both are pretty much the same


[27-Apr-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
a warning is a warning


[27-Apr-20 09:29 PM] bman#0435
wait but shouldnt there be a vote for it to be a warning? or nah


[27-Apr-20 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
we dont do votes for all warnings


[27-Apr-20 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
because its not that big of a consequence compared to a suspension


[27-Apr-20 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
or demotion


[27-Apr-20 09:29 PM] bman#0435
ye


[27-Apr-20 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
i never post votes for something I just warn them for


[27-Apr-20 09:30 PM] bman#0435

**BUBBLE CHAT STAFF REPORTS**

Greetings Managers!

       From now on, I kindly ask that you please refrain from accepting bubble chat proof in staff reports. Complications such as no requirement to use grammar in whisper chats and possible photoshopping makes it challenging to depict what is valid and invalid evidence against a staff member. While the chatbox can be photoshopped as well, it is a more reliable and dependable source compared to the bubbles. Again, bubble chats should no longer be accepted within the staff report channel. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to an HR!

**BUBBLE CHAT STAFF REPORTS**

Greetings LRs!

       I am here to inform you that we will no longer be accepting chat bubble proof as evidence against a staff member. Complications between viability of proof has become a challenge when reviewing reports. Please refrain from submitting and evidence against a staff member that only includes the chat bubble above their head, as it will get declined straight away. If you have any questions or concerns about this change, please don't hesitate to contact an HR. Thank you and have a nice night!

Greetings cryinqheart,

This letter serves 28/04/2020 at 04:00 AM BST confirming your termination as Head of Services here at Bloxton Hotels. The High-Rank Team was recently notified of inappropriate behaviour while training one of our trainees at a Bloxton training session. After reviewing the evidence provided, we've deemed your actions as sexual harassment and this is completely unacceptable coming from a Bloxton Hotels MR. Due to your actions, we've therefore decided to terminate your employment. We apologize things have come to an end like this, however behaviour like this warrants such actions. We hope you learn from this mistake, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate in replying to this letter.

Signed,

xM_inn
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels

@everyone 

:bloxton3: **NOTICE OF TERMINATION** :bloxton3: 

Greetings Bloxton MRs,

As part of our agreement to be transparent with terminations, I regret to inform you all that **cryinqheart** has been terminated from their position as Head of Services here at Bloxton Hotels due to sexual harassment during a Bloxton training session. This individual thought it was acceptable to sexually harass a trainee during the troller simulation which is completely unacceptable. Due to their actions, the High-Rank Team has decided to terminate this member from the team.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this termination, feel free to DM a member of the High-Rank Team. Please also remember that you may not leak this termination to any non-MRs as that'd be leaking which can and will result in an instant termination from your position. Have a nice evening everyone.

Best regards,

xM_inn
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels

**BUBBLE CHAT STAFF REPORTS**

Greetings Managers!

       From now on, I kindly ask that you please refrain from accepting bubble chat proof in staff reports. Complications such as no requirement to use grammar in whisper chats and possible photoshopping makes it difficult to depict what is valid and invalid evidence against a staff member. While the chatbox can be photoshopped as well, it is a more reliable and dependable source compared to the bubbles. Again, bubble chats will no longer be accepted within the staff report channel. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to an HR!

Hi Blaire, just wanted to remind you to be keeping a closer eye on supervision at trainings, specifically heads, as the recent issue with an MR being terminated was at session you were at. Remember that just because heads are MRs as well, you still need to be supervising them. All MRs need to be acting appropriately at sessions and if you‚Äôre ever unsure of a situation, you can notify the host or message any HR concerns you may have.


[27-Apr-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
Ok how‚Äôs something like that

[28-Apr-20 01:00 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ik it‚Äôs a drug but like that would be a stupid reason to demote


[28-Apr-20 01:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye its appropriate


[28-Apr-20 01:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause theres ecstatic too


[28-Apr-20 01:04 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs different tho


[28-Apr-20 01:05 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ectasy is a drug and estatic is an emotion


[28-Apr-20 01:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
no choiceeeeeee


[28-Apr-20 01:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[28-Apr-20 08:38 AM] ethan;#0003

Me: So, do you think this is acceptable behaviour? *provides screenshots*

Her: **Yes,** however, that was during the troll test. I thought I was allowed to say that, so the trainee can warn me for being "inappropriate".


[28-Apr-20 10:53 AM] stacey#1000
BAHAHAHAHA


[28-Apr-20 10:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809

BUBBLE CHAT STAFF REPORTS

Greetings LRs!

       I am here to inform you that we will no longer be accepting chat bubble proof as evidence against a staff member. Complications between viability of proof has become a challenge when reviewing reports. Please refrain from submitting and evidence against a staff member that only includes the chat bubble above their head, as it will get declined straight away. If you have any questions or concerns about this change, please don't hesitate to contact an HR. Thank you and have a nice night!

[28-Apr-20 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
It's worth it


[28-Apr-20 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
Bloo is going to a LEO as well!


[28-Apr-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
um about death1y and his promo option...


[28-Apr-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
he clearly didnt want to work with us anymore considering he left bh for sb


[28-Apr-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
and he "resigned" from sb once we reported harriet to them and magically got his rank back when the investigation was finished


[28-Apr-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
not to mention, i dont think ive ever seen him since like 2019 lmao


[28-Apr-20 04:57 PM] bman#0435
@xM_inn ^


[28-Apr-20 04:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
..


[28-Apr-20 04:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
he didnt resign because of harriet


[28-Apr-20 04:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
that isnt fair bringing SB inside of it


[28-Apr-20 04:59 PM] xM_inn#2821
and i see him whenever i host


[28-Apr-20 04:59 PM] xM_inn#2821
hes usually on during early to around 7-8pm BST hours


[28-Apr-20 05:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
and he left BH to focus on SB in 2018, we're now in 2020. if he didnt want to work for us, maybe he **wouldn't** be working for us?


[28-Apr-20 05:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
and if i remember correctly, deathy was the only person who actually handled the harriet situation properly


[28-Apr-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
I mean I think him resigning from SB just to come back a month later is something we need to consider


[28-Apr-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
And no it's not because it's SB specifically


[28-Apr-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
I'd be concerned for anyone who showed a lack of commitment like that and changed their mind super fast


[28-Apr-20 05:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
true


[28-Apr-20 05:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
He didn't resign nor come back because of Harriet, it's something else but I can't leak that because it's private


[28-Apr-20 05:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
I understand your concern tho


[28-Apr-20 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
But I don't think we should be allowing SB to make a huge impact on his promotion at Bloxton


[28-Apr-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
Ngl I had no idea he even worked for us, I don't think I've ever seen him lol and I've been visiting a lot of sessions lately


[28-Apr-20 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
I mean, if we're going to look at his resignations, let's also look at the good stuff he's done at SB


[28-Apr-20 05:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
He was in the management at SB for 2+ years which is great commitment


[28-Apr-20 05:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
He's professional


[28-Apr-20 05:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
And I see him a lot, particularly before I went on notice, but I saw him today at my session as well


[28-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
He's also only submmited like


[28-Apr-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
MAYBE 15 reports total in the 2 months he's been back


[28-Apr-20 05:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Maybe he sends them to a manager


[28-Apr-20 05:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[28-Apr-20 05:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
I just think we should also look at the positives rather than jumping straight to negatives


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
Jk it was 7 reports lol


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
And he has a lot of experience; former MR here and a current HR at SB


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
o oof


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
I thought we weren't looking at SB stuff


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
Y'all started looking at SB stuff


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
If you don't wanna count his resignation we can't count what he's done at SB


[28-Apr-20 05:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
Then we shouldn't count SB at all


[28-Apr-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah and I'm saying I have other reasons not to want to promo him rn lol so I can ignore the whole "I'm gonna resign, not tell you about it as you're actively reporting something huge to me, then come back 2 weeks later and still not acknowledge you"


[28-Apr-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
Fiasco


[28-Apr-20 05:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright, well let's stay off the topic of SB


[28-Apr-20 05:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Reasons we should and shoudn't promote?


[28-Apr-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
7 reports total in 2020


[28-Apr-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
Which likely indicates minimal hotel activity, as we all know it's pretty hard to be at the hotel for more than 10 minutes and not find one  reason


[28-Apr-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
I've never personally seen him at a session, could be due to timezones but I visit sessions at different times so idk


[28-Apr-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
He doesn't really talk in our discord server either


[28-Apr-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
Which yeah isn't a requirement but it does kind of show he's not active in our community


[28-Apr-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think we should just give him more time as far as i'm concerned


[28-Apr-20 05:09 PM] emma;#1525
Did anyone actually recommend him


[28-Apr-20 05:09 PM] emma;#1525
Like a senior


[28-Apr-20 05:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i just don't think he'll fit


[28-Apr-20 05:09 PM] katie#0200
i think ive seen him at a couple of my sessions but if he‚Äôs only submitted 7 reports that‚Äôs a bit unfair to those who‚Äôve had to submit hundreds before getting promoted


[28-Apr-20 05:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not from what i recall


[28-Apr-20 05:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't really see him that much at the hotel either


[28-Apr-20 05:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Idk I didn't check the senior board


[28-Apr-20 05:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's the thing though


[28-Apr-20 05:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's look at another sb member who has a huge role


[28-Apr-20 05:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
jessica might i add


[28-Apr-20 05:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
I just think he could be a good candidate


[28-Apr-20 05:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well i'm gonna disagree


[28-Apr-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
Ya I disagree for now


[28-Apr-20 05:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok I'll archive


[28-Apr-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
If he shows more commitment to us


[28-Apr-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
then I would reevaluate


[28-Apr-20 05:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i find his activity to be a bit behind compared to others and i don't think his focus w/ us is going to be very high


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] emma;#1525
but it doesn't seem like he really actually.... does much... with us right now other than an occasional shift and session, which is totally fair considering I'm sure he's busy most of the time


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] emma;#1525
But yeah just not hyped about it


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright let's give him more time


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] emma;#1525
i want to promote someone ugh who should i recommend


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
i want to promote someone too


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] emma;#1525
Bman literally has 4


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not sure but i'll probably watch over sessions and the hotel


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] emma;#1525
can we limit how many recommendations an HR can have at once


[28-Apr-20 05:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
vote please: https://trello.com/c/1KS9BUxO/33251-xlilvyy-head-of-security

No he didn't go rogue


[28-Apr-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
Ik. Milo never did anything wrong did she.


[28-Apr-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
She just resigned


[28-Apr-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
And came back like other formers


[28-Apr-20 05:35 PM] bman#0435

[28-Apr-20 05:35 PM] bman#0435
deeply involved with the zippy situation


[28-Apr-20 05:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah but it wasn't really her fault


[28-Apr-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
She reported it to us


[28-Apr-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
She was a victim of it


[28-Apr-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
She never did anything wrong to get fired


[28-Apr-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
She resigned on her own terms and now she‚Äôs back and has been really active for over a month


[28-Apr-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
true but her behavior is a bit much still


[28-Apr-20 05:40 PM] emma;#1525
i thought milo was involved in drama


[28-Apr-20 05:40 PM] emma;#1525
that she started


[28-Apr-20 05:40 PM] emma;#1525
i could be wrong tho


[28-Apr-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bonnie591 nah deputy director


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Director


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Actually


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Fuck that she should be governor


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
lets just make her DPS


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
No governor


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
dps sec getting impeached


[28-Apr-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
üíÄ


[28-Apr-20 05:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Eek


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
And the deputy sec declined his nomination since he's ss director


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
Which ig that's reasonable


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
That means its gonna be offered to t1dtony probs


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cause hes associtate director


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
And I dont like him


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey Wait so did Bia leave because she was being questioned?


[28-Apr-20 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm new secretary


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
She knew she did something wrong and when Emma was questioning her the next day she resigned


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok well


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
I believe


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
She also made up stories and lied about things


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
She shouldn't be given her former MR role


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
If she's leaved during an active investigation


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
To avoid consequences


[28-Apr-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
We can do that but rn can we decide punishment for Lauren


[28-Apr-20 05:49 PM] stacey#1000
And if Ella is getting consequences or not


[28-Apr-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
alright


[28-Apr-20 05:49 PM] stacey#1000
This was a messy investigation. Like honestly


[28-Apr-20 05:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This was a shitshow


[28-Apr-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
There was so many people involved I told Emma and trey and they helped me with this


[28-Apr-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
Because like


[28-Apr-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
So many people


[28-Apr-20 05:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
omg ive just loaded the card-


[28-Apr-20 05:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
theres so much proof im confused already


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
Yes it‚Äôs confusing right


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
The thing that stood out to me the most was Bia and Lauren‚Äôs behaviour


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
aight so


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
go from bottom to top @xM_inn


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
And the proof of Ella trash talking was over a month before she was even a head


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that should basically summarize it


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] bman#0435
isnt the first report with wolfy being included and disrespectful


[28-Apr-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs like 3 months old evidence against Ella now


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm confused on what to do with Ella


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
alright brb in 10 hours when ive finished reviewing all of this


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
She reported this to us but was also involved


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
So-


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
And Lauren legit her behaviour as a senior.


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
Is disappointing


[28-Apr-20 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
No thx to her getting shift


[28-Apr-20 05:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
lauren always seems to be involved in drama


[28-Apr-20 05:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
whether


[28-Apr-20 05:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
its her being the reporter


[28-Apr-20 05:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
or her being involved


[28-Apr-20 05:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
like remember those reporting GCs a while back, she always seemed to be involved in them


[28-Apr-20 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah she‚Äôs always seeming to be doing some sort of trash talking


[28-Apr-20 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I need to add something to the card


[28-Apr-20 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
I forgot


[28-Apr-20 05:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
ok so there seems to be a LOT of proof on ella (wolfy)


[28-Apr-20 05:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
and this aint the first time shes been involved in drama


[28-Apr-20 05:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
now did ella report herself or is there an additional source?


[28-Apr-20 05:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
ik ella reported bia and lauren


[28-Apr-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
but i dont think shes capable of reporting herself


[28-Apr-20 05:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the proof against her was by them @xM_inn


[28-Apr-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
ah ok


[28-Apr-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
so lauren and bia reported ella while ella reported lauren and bia?


[28-Apr-20 05:59 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok so


[28-Apr-20 05:59 PM] stacey#1000
I attached evidence of me questioning Ella


[28-Apr-20 05:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yessir @xM_inn


[28-Apr-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we questioned all of them so far and uhh


[28-Apr-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
none of them are adding up


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
stacey can back me up on this


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
Everyone else seems to have a different story


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
And it‚Äôs confusing


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i hated how all of them handled it ngl @stacey


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
Ella tells me she was randomly blocked by Lauren and Bia and then they trash talked in a gc


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] emma;#1525
Here's my whole understanding of this situation


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
And Kayla then reported it to me as well


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
While we appreciate Ella's cooperation in reporting this incident, she isn't exactly innocent herself and there is a big pile of proof against her on that card, this also isn't the first time she's been involved in something like this. Not as much proof on Lauren, but again not the first time she's been involved in something like this, and she's also a senior which means she should be withholding better standards. Bia tried to run from her problems and resign once she knew she was under investigation, not cool.

I'm personally going to suggest the following:

> Lauren and Ella: 4-7 day suspension, both equally involved in trash-talking and petty drama.

> Bia: Removal of former MR role + promotion black for 6 months.

Opinions? (We can look into it more before finalizing punishments.)


[28-Apr-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
And Ella reported it to trey

Ella has trash talked and said stuff, but it wasn't necessarily about the lauren group FROM WHAT they were able to send us proof wise


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
Whereas there was plenty of proof of Lauren and co trash talking ella directly


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i agree with these to be honest @xM_inn


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
Oh there's plenty of proof on lauren


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but i think both lauren and ella deserve a promotion black too


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
who said there wasnt much


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
There's proof of lauren lying to my face about the apologies she sent lmao


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
is it on the card


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if saab and slee got one for bullying alex


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause if it isnt i havent seen it yet


[28-Apr-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think they should too


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
Saab and slee didn't get an official promo blacklist lol


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
well lauren isnt getting shift, if we want to make it official then sure


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
they did!!!


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
They're unofficially blacklisted bc of their attitudes


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
oh they did?


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
Didn't hear about that one lol


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
ya


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
not mad about it


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
anyways so Lauren told me that she sent two apologies to Ella


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
One she sent through another person (Kylie? was that her name) and Ella rejected it


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
Kayla


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
Which ella confirmed


[28-Apr-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
So she did send the one


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
But Lauren told me she sent a second apology in a gc they all made later with Ella


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Lowkey, it feels like Wolfy and Lauren look for drama sometimes, they always seem to be involved in drama somehow


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
But there was no apology from lauren in that gc after kayla added us to it


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
Only threats


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
:)


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
so


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
I think all of them lied too


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
Because that‚Äôs how it got so confusing


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
minn if you wanna see their "apology" groupchat, its a good read


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes pls


[28-Apr-20 06:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
(:


[28-Apr-20 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
Omg I forgot about that gc because there was so many with this investigation

[28-Apr-20 06:08 PM] bman#0435

[28-Apr-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000
And if she decides to resign because of it and not learn from her actions then I won‚Äôt be sad


[28-Apr-20 06:08 PM] xM_inn#2821

Early death is better


[28-Apr-20 06:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
shes just throwing away everything shes worked for, if shes prepared to do that, then ok


[28-Apr-20 06:09 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Just for a freaking small punishment


[28-Apr-20 06:09 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[28-Apr-20 06:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[28-Apr-20 06:11 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

Let‚Äôs suspend both for a week


[28-Apr-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I guess the question now is who wants to suspend who


[28-Apr-20 06:21 PM] bman#0435
a week? 0-0


[28-Apr-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Apr-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000

Greetings ellaaqz,

This is a letter to inform you of your suspension from your position of rank 9 | Head of Services here at Bloxton Hotels. This suspension will last for a duration of 5 days and will end on May 3rd at 8:00 PM EST. You have been suspended from your position because the High Rank team has determined you have been directly involved with trash talking others and contributing to a drama situation. We understand you have reported your concerns to us and we would like to thank you for doing so. However, you were still directly involved with this situation and we hope you learn from your mistakes during the duration of your suspension. As an MR, you set an example to others and should never contribute to any drama situations. As soon as it happens, it is best to report the situation to an HR ASAP. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message any member of the HR team. 

Sincerely,
Mackpacker
Shift Manager 
Bloxton Hotels.

[28-Apr-20 06:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[28-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
Basically other MRs trash talking people and acting immature


[28-Apr-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Apr-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
We should ask her why she‚Äôs using 2 accs


[28-Apr-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
what if she gave the other account access to a cb or someone that shouldnt be viewinhg sl...


[28-Apr-20 06:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Apr-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Apr-20 06:57 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[28-Apr-20 06:57 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Apr-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't suspend her yet


[28-Apr-20 07:35 PM] bman#0435
its fine, i can deal without them. they clearly arent interested enough to assist in an interview session


[28-Apr-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She was hosting a session earlier


[28-Apr-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525

[28-Apr-20 07:40 PM] bman#0435
@emma; i get that u wanted to do something for fun with the mrs and to have min play tdi for the first time but just be more considerate and not plan them last minute the same time/near sessions .over half the mrs in my server left to go to the gamenight and u guys were telling me to just beg for them to come back but u had already begged for them to "ditch" my session. i understand that was a joke too but its just annoying because i already struggle enough to get mrs into my servers


[28-Apr-20 07:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait u struggle?


[28-Apr-20 07:41 PM] bman#0435

[28-Apr-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
@bman I never told you to beg for anyone to come back, I told you that almost 20 MRs had said they aren't going to the gamenight so if you'd just asked in staff discussion (not begged, *asked* like a normal person) you prob coulda replaced the 5 that left lol


[28-Apr-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
I also never begged anyone to ditch your session


[28-Apr-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
I said "leave interviews" as a joke and then dotted it 5 times, which Minn also did lol so don't just get mad at me üòÇ we've been having gamenights overlap with sessions for a long time and no one's ever been this pressed about it


[28-Apr-20 07:53 PM] Cam#5887
this person got mad at me cause i fired them for copying bloxton models


[28-Apr-20 07:53 PM] Cam#5887
lol


[28-Apr-20 07:53 PM] Cam#5887
now shes trying to get out of it


[28-Apr-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
u told me to harass people to come back to my server lol. and im not mad about the fact that you told people to leave interviews, its that you decided to last minute plan a gamenight which caused a bundle of mrs to leave my session. idc that they left since im pretty much used to having a low count of mrs at my sessions at this point but its just annoying


[28-Apr-20 08:19 PM] emma;#1525
@bman Are you literally thick


[28-Apr-20 08:19 PM] emma;#1525
How many times do I have to say "I didn't tell you to harass anyone to come **back**" before you listen


[28-Apr-20 08:19 PM] emma;#1525
Whatever be mad lmao you literally aren't going to listen to a word I say so whatever

yeah @stacey kelvin was asking me about how people get promos and then he photoshopped what i said making it seem like i said he was close to a promo and he sent it to jessie


[29-Apr-20 09:59 AM] stacey#1000
Time for him to get blacklisted!!!


[29-Apr-20 10:00 AM] katie#0200
and kelvin is denying all of it saying some person whos been targetting him or whatever has somehow magically got into our dms, photoshopped it and sent it to someone using the same tag as kelvin

what the fuck


[29-Apr-20 01:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm actually tempted to suspend him


[29-Apr-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's acting worse than kenzi


[29-Apr-20 01:39 PM] bman#0435
apparently im a snob???


[29-Apr-20 01:39 PM] bman#0435

[29-Apr-20 01:39 PM] bman#0435
that i sent


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
tbh mirk has been acting differently


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
nah bro


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we gotta vote


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
like his grammar isnt even proper


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this shit is inexcusable


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
ye i wanted more people to see what he did before doing a vote


[29-Apr-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
since only 2 people were online when i pinged


[29-Apr-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
cookie and katie


[29-Apr-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is actually making me angry


[29-Apr-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
ill do a vote when i get home


[29-Apr-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
honestly


[29-Apr-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this should be a fire


[29-Apr-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's why:


[29-Apr-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) I doubt the user gave them permission, and he's not telling who it is either. Out of all places, why staff lounge?


[29-Apr-20 01:44 PM] emma;#1525
He claimed the photos were of a manager, right


[29-Apr-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) He was really disrespectful and insulting towards you, and given the context after the Training Center, he is not getting better. I'm fed up of the way he's behaving even though we told him to stop. @bman


[29-Apr-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, he did. @emma;


[29-Apr-20 01:44 PM] emma;#1525
So... why don't we just ask him which manager it is


[29-Apr-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll proceed to ask him.


[29-Apr-20 01:45 PM] bman#0435
he wont say who lol hes keeping it ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù but had no issue letting every mr guess who


[29-Apr-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If circumstances are different, I say go for a long suspension, due to acting disrespectful to Bman.


[29-Apr-20 01:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's basically creating a situation where he could've fixed it, and it's pissing me off.


[29-Apr-20 01:46 PM] emma;#1525
Literally tell him that we need to verify with the manager that it was okay or he is going to be in trouble for doxxing


[29-Apr-20 01:46 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey


[29-Apr-20 01:47 PM] emma;#1525
So if he can't give us a name we'll assume he doxxed


[29-Apr-20 01:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let me question him first. @bman


[29-Apr-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then we'll go for it.


[29-Apr-20 01:48 PM] bman#0435
ight but either way he shouldnt be posting the managers face in sl lol


[29-Apr-20 01:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No doubt.


[29-Apr-20 01:49 PM] emma;#1525
If the manager gave him permission, it's not doxxing and we can't punish him for it


[29-Apr-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
These people are free to send their faces around if that's what they want lol


[29-Apr-20 01:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can however punish him for his treatment with Bman.


[29-Apr-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
Well


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
You can't prove that a status is directed at anyone without their name being included


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
he changed it when i didnt message him back...


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
And the DM mirk sent wasn't even aggressive


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not sure why y'all are getting super pressed over it


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
Tbh lol


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
i never said it was aggressive


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It kind of was, pretty immature too.


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
not sure where u got aggressive from


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
No it wasn't Trey


[29-Apr-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
We tell MRs that we want them to let us know when they're upset


[29-Apr-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
So mirk does that and now he's aggressive and immature...?


[29-Apr-20 01:52 PM] bman#0435
he used being inactive as an excuse


[29-Apr-20 01:52 PM] bman#0435
brb


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know, the screenshots kind of add up.


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm waiting for him to respond.


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not saying Mirk is gonna win a manager of the year award


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mirk's a head lol


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
But just based off the things Bman has sent, I don't see anything more than a warning being applicable based on those conversations


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
Whatever same gist


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
If there's more that I don't know about that might impact my view on the situation then I'd love to know it lol


[29-Apr-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
But I kind of think y'all are overreacting a bit


[29-Apr-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think so, I'm a little worried of how he's acting.


[29-Apr-20 01:54 PM] emma;#1525
If mirk got upset because Bman didn't answer his DMs fast enough, that's something Bman should have handled himself by reminding Mirk that we can't answer DMs right away and that he needs to be respectful of that instead of getting upset


[29-Apr-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let me explain the situation from yesterday.


[29-Apr-20 01:54 PM] emma;#1525
But the actual 'paragraph' mirk sent isn't bad in my opinion


[29-Apr-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So basically, he was acting kind of childish. Bman teleported himself in the TC, and he proceeds to run in and try to get in. LRs try to join in, then Bman proceeds to say "I'm not sure why people are getting up." He still tries to get in and everyone else tells him to sit down, which I'm a little concerned about. Also, while Kami was naming and two people tried to have a photo together, Mirk proceeds to act really annoying and photobombs them. If I'm being honest, he's not following directions very well.


[29-Apr-20 01:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no that isn't bad at all emma


[29-Apr-20 01:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
idk why a termination would be brought up because of that, even a suspension if that


[29-Apr-20 01:59 PM] emma;#1525
Okay well Trey that wasn't mentioned anywhere at all in Bman's report and that would be a totally separate incident to handle


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Still, the fact that these are different days apart makes me kind of concerned.


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
That's not related to the "potential doxxing" thing at all so if you are wanting to address training center immaturity then that's fine but that's not at all related to this other thing


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
concerned about what


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Less than a week, might I add.


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that paragraph isn't concerning at all


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
The other tuff yes


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
You know what concerns me


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
stuff*


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
not that shit


[29-Apr-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
Y'all see MRs acting badly, do nothing about it and then are confused when they keep doing it üòÇ


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
emma


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Why wasn't Mirk confronted about that during the situation


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Why is it only becoming an issue after the fact


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma, he was literally warned and confronted about it.


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
please point out in that paragraph what is so concerning


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
you too try


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
trey


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Then if he was already warned


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Why is it still an issue


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Has it happened again since the warning


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
the other shit has been dealth with


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
this is a new case


[29-Apr-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not liking how he points out "I know you don't like me"


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming The only part of the paragraph I don't love is the beginning when he says "Ik you either hate me or dont like how i act" bc that's just dramatic but other than that I don't see his paragraph as a big deal


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
And that's not termination worthy at all lol


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he should've been a little more respectful


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
not at all


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
im sure he is pissed


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
I mean I felt like the rest of the paragraph was respectful


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
imo


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I would be too


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like that's not really a good start


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but he learned his lesson


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oop hold on


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He just DM'd me


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Brb


[29-Apr-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
So let's just go over all of the concerns with Mirk and why I'm confused as to why we're still talking about them lol


[29-Apr-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
1) If he was misbehaving at the TC, that is the hosts job to correct and if he was already warned it's already been dealt with


[29-Apr-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
2) If he was upset at Bman in DMs for not answering right away, that's Bman's thing to deal with and warn him for if needed


[29-Apr-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
3) we literally can't prove a status was aimed at anyone even if the timing is coincedental lol


[29-Apr-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525
The only potential issue we have is mirk "doxxing" which hopefully we'll have answers to in a minute


[29-Apr-20 02:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ya agreed


[29-Apr-20 02:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
nothing more should come from this unless something drastic happens


[29-Apr-20 02:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
he shouldn't be treated any differently either to try to provoke him.


[29-Apr-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
People are so trigger happy when it comes to punishments lol


[29-Apr-20 02:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh-

[29-Apr-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
lol


[29-Apr-20 02:12 PM] bman#0435
it was the first thing i mentioned in the ping


[29-Apr-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah but you said "He clearly hasn't learned anything from it" and yet to my knowledge his TC actions weren't repeated?


[29-Apr-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
o i was just saying that since u said i didnt mention the warning anywhere in the report


[29-Apr-20 02:15 PM] emma;#1525
Well you didn't mention it was a TC incident so I didn't realize that's what you were talking about lol


[29-Apr-20 02:15 PM] emma;#1525
But if he was already warned for it, can you explain how he continued to be immature and unprofessional outside of the manager photo and DMs thing

Trey, I am on a message with her, and she doesn't want too.
If, she didn't feel comfortable she would tell a HR.


[29-Apr-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
Literally if he's not complying then we're treating it like doxxing


[29-Apr-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[29-Apr-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525

[29-Apr-20 06:58 PM] Cam#5887

[29-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Cam#5887

**DECLINE OF FRIENDSHIP**

Hello, @RAMMGaming!

As sad as it may seem, but I am announcing that our friendship has officially come to a close as of 5:49 PM. I don't think that us both make a good pair nor do we get along with each other. As a result, your office has been officially removed as well from the office. I am discontinuing this friendship not because I hate you, but due to the fact that we do not get along and that is the main purpose. Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

[30-Apr-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
lol probably that i told her if she's going to refuse to comply and is involved in leaking scandals that she can't be trusted to be in the discord server


[30-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
so now i'm gonna tell her that since she's disclosing private conversations related to an investigation, she is going to be banned


[30-Apr-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
:)


[30-Apr-20 10:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she made a ticket about you lol @emma;


[30-Apr-20 10:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
go to  #ticket-1459


[30-Apr-20 10:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
scare her off there lmao


[30-Apr-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
i just closed her ticket


[30-Apr-20 10:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what is basically the full context of it @emma;


[30-Apr-20 10:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
sorry if i sound slow


[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
so she had this screenshot

[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
yes


[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
so I dmed her asking who sent it to her


[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
and she said "my friend who isnt an MR"


[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
so i asked for a name


[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
and she goes "he doesnt want me to tell you, also he blocked you"


[30-Apr-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
so i said she needs to give me a name and that i can't punish her friend for having that screenshot if he's not an MR so it's not an issue


[30-Apr-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
she still refused


[30-Apr-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
and given her history of being banned and causing trouble i told her that if she's involved in a leaking scandal and will not cooperate with an investigation, she will be removed from the server as that is a threat to our safety


[30-Apr-20 10:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ahhh


[30-Apr-20 10:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i see


[30-Apr-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
so she tried to report me i guess bc i said i *could* ban her (guess what i didnt ban her)


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
OHHHHH


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
now she's saying she talked to an MR about the situation and he asked for our private DM conversations


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
now i get it


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
mxxndo apparently


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
which i do NOT appreciate him asking for private DMs between an HR and someone being investigated


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
at all


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
so if he was gonna be promoted


[30-Apr-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525

[30-Apr-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
im waiting for him to respond


[30-Apr-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
its not *that* serious but it just irritates me that he would knowingly ask for screenshots of an investigation


[30-Apr-20 10:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@emma; wasn‚Äôt his fault


[30-Apr-20 10:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I‚Äôm already talking to him


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] emma;#1525
Why lol


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He DMed me


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] emma;#1525
like just now?


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
An hour ago


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Casp approached him


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] emma;#1525
About verdin?


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Mhm


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Did you not see what I tagged you in


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] emma;#1525
He needs to not be involved in that ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He didn‚Äôt ask


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] emma;#1525
He already got her to send him private DMs between me and casp that are *confidential* or at least are supposed to be


[30-Apr-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Casp approaches and sent it all to him


[30-Apr-20 10:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Where do you see him asking for proof


[30-Apr-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
That's what Casp told me, that he asked her to send him screenshots of our DMs


[30-Apr-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
Hence why I dmed casp


[30-Apr-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
to ask


[30-Apr-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
and put that thing on the card


[30-Apr-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
I don't think it's a *huge* deal either way


[30-Apr-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I means that just proves he‚Äôs even more ready for management to me as he‚Äôs willing to get involved but your right it isn‚Äôt his business


[30-Apr-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But why Casp approached him, NO CLUE


[30-Apr-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Approached him at the hotel

[30-Apr-20 10:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what the fuck is she doing hiding info


[30-Apr-20 10:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's my biggest concern


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] emma;#1525
I think he's friends with casp


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We can use the good old youre a threat to Bloxton so we will ban you from the server


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] emma;#1525
So apparently she wanted to get me fired (new day same threats)


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] emma;#1525
and mxxndo did try to calm her down and be like that's probably a bit extreme


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] emma;#1525
and in the process asked for the DMs that she found offensive


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] emma;#1525
and she ended up sending the whole thing LOL


[30-Apr-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He yeah got involved indirectly.


[30-Apr-20 10:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Definitely not on him tbh


[30-Apr-20 10:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
In my opinion


[30-Apr-20 10:27 PM] emma;#1525
so i just told him in the future to direct people to another HR instead of trying to get involved directly because usually the HRs will be aware of the situation anyways and will handle it better


[30-Apr-20 10:27 PM] emma;#1525
not a reason to not promote him, I just wanted to be cautious because literally you NEVER KNOW WOOOO love this job lol


[30-Apr-20 10:27 PM] emma;#1525
so i deleted my comment


[30-Apr-20 10:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
