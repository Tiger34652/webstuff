:washiez: **High Rank // Operations Department Application |** @Supervision Team 


Greetings everyone!

Many of you have been patiently waiting for the opportunity to become a member of our High Rank Team and now is your chance! The newly formed Operations Department is looking for many new and experienced users to join us in jumpstarting the ~~best~~ department here at Washiez!

Below you will find the link to our application, please take a moment to read over the requirements that are listed before you begin your application. We ask that you take your time and put some consideration into your answers while completing this application. Anyone above the rank of Shift Leader is welcome to apply!

If you make it past the application phase, you will be required to undergo an interview with one of our Chief Operating Officers. These interviews may also be observed by any member of the Operations Department. You are required to have a microphone and be open to speaking in a VC. 

The main goals of the operations department are to supervise the game, answer tickets and promote users at trainings. The official list of duties is obviously more in-depth but these are the main tasks you would be completing on a day to day basis. 

On behalf of the Operations Department, we wish you the best of luck!

Greetings everyone!

I have seen in the past few days that there‚Äôs always arguments going on about the TC. The topic which has been argued about the most is joining the training center too early. I just wanted to remind y‚Äôall that joining the training center too early isn‚Äôt punishable, so it‚Äôs **allowed.** Also one last thing I‚Äôd like to mention is that you guys shouldn‚Äôt use :sm or :m without receiving perms from the host or a BOD+. Not following this rule will lead to consequences. 

*Thank you for reading this, hope you‚Äôll have a great a day!*

We apologize for the issues some of you guys have been experiencing. Moving forward, we'll be enforcing stricter security measures to make sure this doesn't happen again. Everyone has been unbanned from the game. We've also removed the ability to use "all" with the admin commands. Thank you for your understanding!

:washiez:  **Joining The Training Center Too Early**

Hey everybody, I've noticed MRs joining the training center way too early when they are supposed to be joining. Not only this, but certain MRs have also joined early, and admin abused. Firstly, there is no reason to be joining the training center an hour in advance. You should also not be joining an hour in advance to claim your roles, join at **xx:30.** If you happen to be new, feel free to ask if you cannot find the training times or guides. If you are still confused or have any questions feel free to ask around! 

**Training Times:**  12:00 PM EST, 9:00 AM PST, 5:00 PM BST
3:00 PM EST, 12:00 PM PST, 8:00 PM BST
6:00 PM EST, 3:00 PM PST, 11:00 PM BST

:washiez: **STAFF PANEL UPDATE**

Hello Management Team! I am ecstatic to announce the newest update to the main wash. This update is the long waited for, Staff Panel! This panel will assist you all in supervising the carwash. This feature is located in the top left of your screen. (Where the shield emoji is) Once you click that icon, a panel will appear where you can then warn people. Once a person reaches 3 warnings you will be able to send them to the jail. 

Along with the Staff Panel update, @Iced (@FormallyIced) and I have worked together on updating the Basic Admin commands. We have now updated what commands MRs and Corporate have access to. This will hopefully make it easier for overall in-game supervision. 

Thank you to everyone for waiting so patiently for this update. Stay tuned for future staff updates.

:washiez: | **Promotions and Hinting**

Hello everyone, I hope you're having a great day so far. I would like to make it clear to our management team that you can only be promoted to a higher rank by attending many trainings sessions/outstanding  activity in the car wash and displaying professionalism.

-Explicitly or implicitly asking for a rank up WILL result in your chances of a promotion **being decreased** :
e.g. *'I've been so active and I'm still a Shift Leader!'* or *'I want to be a High Rank!'*. 

The Human Resources Department are supervising the MR team very closely to make sure hard work and dedication is rewarded. You may feel as though you are not seen, however we do accept promotion recommendations **from other MRs exclusively**.

Please note that if you are caught hinting excessively/disrespectfully, this will result in a consequence. If you have any questions, feel free to message a member of the  Corporate Team.

:washiez:  | **Board of Director Rank Reformation**

Greetings, everyone! The SR team have been discussing and we have decided to enforce stricter rules upon Board of Directors and make changes on the requirements on earning the rank.

‚û£ We are enforcing the activity requirements more from now on. Spending minimal amounts of time in-game will no longer be accepted.
‚û£ Unprofessionalism, inadequate grammar, toxicity (in-game and in the Discord server) and any sort of admin abuse will now be considered a major offence; a demotion to General Manager may be issued as a consequence.
‚û£ From now on, you must be a General Manager for a minimum of **3 weeks** in order to be eligible for a promotion to Board of Directors. We will also ask for a clean record in terms of admin abuse.
‚û£ The limit of Board of Directors at a time will be **41** - however this will be subject to change.

This may seem harsh, however please remember that you are 1 rank away from becoming part of the Corporate Team. I'd like to remind the current BODs that you are all meeting these standards and are doing an amazing job- *you wouldn't be where you are if you weren't!* 

If you have any other inquiries, please feel free to direct them towards me or any other member of the Human Resources Department.

Signed,

~~Greetings Washiez moderation team! I‚Äôm happy to announce that the @Human Resources Department  members will join a few servers and give out well deserved promotions! Please note that the joins are going to be random, so don‚Äôt feel discouraged if there‚Äôs no HRD member in your server since this is not the last time we‚Äôre doing promotional shifts. 

**How can I get promoted?**
Only MR+ are getting promotions and you can earn them by outstanding moderation and professionalism. Asking a higher rank, expressing an aspiration for, or hinting towards a promotion is prohibited as a staff member, and will result in a consequence.

*Now make sure to join the car wash and have a bigger chance on receiving a promotion!*~~

:washiez: | **Management Team Reminders**

Hello everyone. I'd like to remind you all of the standards and expectations put into place for MRs - most importantly **professionalism** - in the Training Center and the Discord.

*Training Center*
-It has come to my attention that many MRs have been acting unprofessionally during trainings once they've finished their group. Please note that while there are Low Ranks in the server, **you are to remain professional at all times**. Playing/goofing around in the presence of those trying to concentrate during trainings is  not the sort of behaviour that should be displayed.
-Another issue that has been raised is trainers leaving sessions midway. If you are unsure that you are unable to stay in-game for the entirety of a session, please **do not** ask to be a (Co)Host/Trainer. 

*Discord Server*
-We understand that #supervision-chat is a space for our staff to be themselves and to have fun with colleagues- however we've received far too many complaints on users referencing NSFW, bypassing, being disrespectful to staff and starting drama. We aren't trying to restrict your fun, but please make sure to strictly abide by our regulations while chatting.

If you have any inquiries, feel free to DM the Corporate team.

**Role Color Poll** 

Hey Management Team! Recently Magik, Bella, and myself worked on changing the role colors to make things less confusing for all parties within Washiez. Before this color change, we had 2-3 roles under one color, and we had a hard time differing who was what. We changed the role colors, and our HRs and LRs all liked the change. I have been made aware that a lot of you are not happy about your colors. Therefore I have decided to do a poll for what color scheme you would rather have. 

:yellowhearts: - Yellow Gradient 
:1n_pastelredhearts: - Red Gradient

Hello everyone! Due to there be a lot of misinformation and confusion around the utilization of grammar on discord I just wanted to update everyone.

We do **not** require you to utilize grammar within the **Discord**, grammar is still required in game and for @Corporate Team(s) while handling any tickets. 

We only require grammar through formal means of communication, such as strikes, tickets, in game operations, etc. So to reiterate, grammar is **not** required in the discord chats and you will not be punished for such reason. If you have received a strike or at some point in the future do, please simply DM one of our @Leadership Team(s) and they will assist you.

:pin: **Training Center Update** 

Hey Management Team! Recently we made a change to our Training Center. Many of you have already picked up on it, but for those who have not, I will help clear things up. Here is what has been changed, along with who is allowed to use what. 

:1line3: Slock/Unslock commands added to Service Manager+ (Should only be used by the host/co-host.) 
:1line3: Trainee - Head Operator has level 0 Basic Admin - (No commands)
:1line3: Shift Leader - Supervisor has level 1 Basic Admin - (Restricted moderator commands)
:1line3: Service Manager - General Manager has level 2 Basic Admin - (Restricted administrator commands) 
:1line3: Board of Directors - Head Corporate has level 3 Basic Admin - (Restricted super administrator commands)
:1line3: Chief Human Resources Officer - Chairman has level 4 Basic Admin - (Creator admin commands) 

Each level of admin has been edited to restrict mass admin abuse. Therefore your admin list may not look the exact same as other games with the same admin system. The biggest change with this update is the **slocking**. This command is only for the Host and Co-Host of the training. Adding this command is making it so our trainings always start on time. **These commands have been added to help, if you choose to abuse them you will be terminated.**

Hello everyone! After discussing with the Super Rank team, we have decided to implement former roles for retired MR+, these will be awarded to users who have dedicated their time to Washiez, giving them deserved recognition within the community. There will be strict requirements to gain this role, due to factors such as rank selling and consequence distribution.

üìù **Middle Rank Requirements**
In order to receive the Former MR role, you must:
‚Ä¢ Have no past terminations.
‚Ä¢ Have worked as an MR for a minimum of  **2 months**.
‚Ä¢ Have attended 30+ sessions.

> High Ranks and Super Ranks have no additional  requirements other than having no past terminations/demotions.

These roles will be distributed effective immediately, meaning we will not be handing out roles to former MRs that have retired before this announcement. If you would like to resign from your position, DM a Chief Human Resources Officer/Chief Administrative Officer so that we can give you the role. Please direct any inquiries to a member of the SR team.

:pin: **PROMOTIONAL SHIFT**

Greetings Washiez Middle-Rank team! I‚Äôm happy to announce that the @Human Resources Department  members will join a few servers and give out well-deserved promotions! Please note that the joins are going to be random, so don‚Äôt feel discouraged if there‚Äôs no HRD member in your server since this is not the last time we‚Äôre doing promotional shifts. 

**How can I get promoted?**
Only *Shift Leaders - Assistant Managers* are getting promotions and you can earn them with outstanding moderation and professionalism. Asking a higher rank, expressing an aspiration for, or hinting towards a promotion is prohibited as a staff member and will result in a consequence.

Concluded, thanks for attending!

:washiez: **RANKING DOWN**

Hello @Supervision Team . We are aware that our ranking is down. Senior Corporates+ can still rank manually but it will take longer than normal. Please keep your group patient while we rank each person. Do not open tickets or tell your trainees to leave the game unless they have to go, we will make it through every server eventually. To add, please encourage those in smaller servers to join larger ones to make this process easier. We thank you for your help in advance.

:washiez: **| BEHAVIOUR AT OTHER GROUPS**

Hey, everyone. It has come to my attention, when visiting groups you do not represent Washiez appropriately. No matter the group, allied or not, if you make it known you work at Washiez, you are representing our group. **You should not be trolling at other establishments regardless of an affiliation or not** and you should definitely not be getting banned. If this issue is reported to us with proof, you are at risk of a consequence. Please represent Washiez maturely, this includes alliance visits. This announcement has nothing to do with the recent events at Cleaniez as it has been reported at other groups. In addition to the recent events with Cleaniez, please do not join their game to cause issues or say anything more about them from this point forward. The SR team will handle anything that may happen, so please do not cause any issues as this will also lead to consequences. We hope to see improved behaviour in the future. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me. 

React once understood.

:washiez: **BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPLICATIONS**

Hello, everyone! On behalf of the Human Resources Department, I am excited to announce that we will be opening applications for the Board of Directors. This rank comes with much more responsibility and trust and we will be choosing the most capable applicants to take the current **16** available spots. The Board of Directors is a group of individuals entrusted with admin commands at the car wash who are held to higher standards by our High Ranks. Please read the following requirements before submitting an application.

:pin: **Requirements**:
> :blueArrow: Applicants must be a **Service Manager or higher**.
> :blueArrow: Applicants must not have safechat.
> :blueArrow: Applicants must have a Discord account and be in this server.
> :blueArrow: Applicants must be able to be active on a daily basis.
> :blueArrow: Grammar, punctuation, and detail are mandatory.

The closure date for these applications will be on **Saturday, August 13, 2022 12:00:00 PM**. Any troll applications will result in a deletion of your application and put you at risk of losing your rank, the same goes for anyone lying about meeting the requirements above. If you have any questions, feel free to DM any Senior Corporate+ in the Human Resources Department. 

Cooldowns are **not** in effect for applications. Good luck! :WhiteSpinningStar:

** :washiez:  Behavior in the Middle Rank chat** 

Hey Management Team! After lurking in the #supervision-chat the past month, I have decided to make an announcement to clarify our rules for MR+ chats. I have seen extremely unprofessional and rude behavior coming from this chat. Being allowed to not use grammar, does not mean to go crazy and cause a scene. I have seen spamming of gifs/emojis, spamming of fake nitro links, hosting random unofficial gamenights, promising Robux and other prizes, advertising other games/groups, and much more. Due to all of this, I have prepared a quick list to help clarify our rules. 

üìï **Rules and Clarifications:** 

Spamming of gifs/images/emojis - You are not allowed to spam at all. Spamming is sending 6+ images/emojis without separation. This will result in a strike.
Sending fake nitro or other clickbait links - This is not permitted. Sending fake prize links will result in a demotion. 
Hosting unofficial gamenights - Gamenights that are not hosted by a PR member will be counted as advertising within Washiez. 
Promising prizes - Promising things like robux, nitro, gift cards, or any of the sort is not permitted. 
Advertising - This is one of our main server rules, you **are not** above the rule. Advertising will result in a ban from our server. 
Online Romance - I have seen many people hosting "weddings" or talking about dating eachother. Online Romance is not allowed. 
Disrespect - Another main server rule. You are not to be disrespectful, and must respect your higher ranks. I have seen so much back talk, and it will not be tolerated anymore. 
Drama - Causing drama within MR chat is not permitted. Discussing strikes/demotions/terminations within our server is not allowed. 
Resignations - If you discuss your resignation within MR chat, saying things like "should i resign" or "i am resigning" is not tolerated. Along with this, if you **MASS RESIGN**, resignations of 5+ people at once, that group of people will be blacklisted. 

I hope this helps all of you to understand our rules better. Keep in mind our main server rules along with my clarifications. **You are not exempt from our rules no matter what channel you are in.**

We will **not** be giving out individuals any reasoning behind their failure due to the massive amount of applications. If you did not pass, please assume your application did not have enough detail or your overall activity did not compare to others who applied. Thank you and have a wonderful rest of your day!

:washiez: **REQUIREMENTS AND INACTIVITY NOTICES**

Hello, everyone! During my time as Chief Human Resources Officer, my main goal has been to make my department more functional and to avoid confusion with our Middle-Rank policies. Today I will be clarifying activity checks and requirements in light of some recent changes.

As for requirements, the **only** rank with enforced requirements is the @Junior Director. Requirements are **NOT** enforced for ranks Shift Leader - General Manager. Attending sessions and being active in-game, however, are required in order to earn a promotion. The requirements for BoDs have slightly changed, they are listed below.

**Board of Directors WEEKLY Requirements**:
> :RedDot: Attend** at least** three training sessions.
> :RedDot: Spend** at least** 90 minutes at the car wash.

As of right now, we are looking for an alternative to checking minutes as our current service is extremely buggy and unreliable. This means that we will not be checking minutes until we find a more reliable service. In-game activity is still required for the Board of Directors and for anyone wanting to earn a promotion, so this is not an excuse to stop moderating the car wash entirely.

Finally, to conclude this announcement, the #inactivity-notices channel has been limited to only Board of Directors. Shift Leaders - General Managers no longer need to log inactivity as requirements are not being enforced. If you need to go inactive, you may do it on your own time and there is no need to let anyone know beforehand.

That's all for today, thank you all for reading and have a wonderful week! ‚ù§Ô∏è

:washiez: **RACING/FIGHTING FOR HOST**

Hello, everyone! Recently, we have had many people racing for host and ending up with arguments that last 10-20 minutes. These arguments have ended in an overall waste of time and with a plethora of disrespectful and entitled comments towards others. To make some clarifications, hosting a training does **not** increase your chances of a promotion or increase your activity at all compared to training or spectating. We do not encourage you to aim for host during all of your attended sessions. This will only cause more arguments which is something we want to avoid.

That being said, if an argument does break out for host, we have a few **suggestions** for those involved.
> :RedDot: Avoid making disrespectful or entitled comments.
> :RedDot: If needed, choose the host by giving it to someone who **1.** claimed on time and **2.** has not hosted at all during that week or has hosted the least amount of trainings.
> :RedDot: Avoid participating in games (hide and seek, pick a number, spin the wheel) to choose hosts or co-hosts in order to save time to prepare for the session.
> :RedDot: If assistance is needed in choosing a host, DM an online Junior Corporate+ in the Operations or Human Resources Department.
> :RedDot: The only people with the authority to tell a server who the host is directly are **Corporates**. They should only be called if either party is not cooperating.

Overall, fighting for host is a waste of time and will more than likely result in you being reported if the situation becomes out of hand. I suggest avoiding these situations, in general, to avoid intense disagreements and wasting time where we could be preparing for a smooth training session.

:washiez: **PROMOTIONAL SHIFT**

Greetings, MRs! I am happy to announce that the @Human Resources Department will be hosting a promotional shift today. These are hosted on Wednesdays each week at varying times depending on our department's availability. Our department members are scattered among servers at the car wash to look for potential promotions! For more information on receiving one of these promotions, keep reading!

**How can I get promoted?**
> During this shift, only *Shift Leaders - Assistant Managers* will be receiving promotions. In order to earn one of these promotions, you can be noticed for outstanding moderation and professionalism. Cooldowns are in effect (10 days since your last promotion) and activity from trainings and minutes will be considered when making our final list. Asking a higher rank, expressing an aspiration for, or hinting towards a promotion is prohibited as a staff member and will result in a consequence.

> Shift concluded.

The finalized list of promotions will be posted in this channel once the shift has ended. Good luck! ‚ù§Ô∏è

:washiez: **Middle Rank Role Model**

Hello Management Team! Have you wondered what it means to be a role model for the lower ranks and customers? Well I am happy to announce a new bi-weekly event to help you all understand what it means to be a role model. This event will be a way for our @Corporate Team and @Leadership Team to see who is upholding the management reputation within Washiez. Here is what we will be on the lookout for;

:linegreen: Helping answer the LRs questions in game and in #staff-chat 
:linegreen: Answering fellow co-workers questions in game and in #supervision-chat 
:linegreen: Welcoming new staff with open arms 
:linegreen: Including your co-workers in conversations
:linegreen: Being professional within the wash and when answering questions 
:linegreen: Helping when asked and not asked 

Those are just a few examples of how to show **us** that you are a role model. Every other week we will host this role model event, and decide on winners. This event will start every other week at **12:00 AM EST, on Sunday** and end at **8:00 PM EST, on Saturday** of the end of the next week. At the end of the week, the High Ranks and Super Ranks will choose our top **five** Middle Rank Role Models. They will receive the following prizes; 

ü•á **1000 Robux**
ü•à **750 Robux**
ü•â **500 Robux**
4Ô∏è‚É£ **250 Robux**
5Ô∏è‚É£ **100 Robux**

This event will be starting this weekend. All of us look forwards to seeing you all step up and be a role model.

:washiez: **Update**: Following discussions with others, we have decided to make it a **requirement** to give **verbal warnings** alongside ones that are given on the warning panel. This is to clear up confusion with necessarily why people are being warned, as doing it from the warning panel does not show them why they were. This causes incidents and arguments to happen and we‚Äôre hoping this resolves it. @Supervision Team

This can be very distracting for both the person training and the trainees. As the host, try to enforce this rule on your trainers. Anyone consistently crowding around groups and causing distractions can be reported to a Human Resources Department member. *Sorry for the abundance of mini pings lately, however, these are important topics so make sure to read each of them carefully.*

:washiez: **Punishment Appeals**

Hello, everyone! Recently, we have made some changes to our punishment appeal form and processes. In the past, we have only revoked punishments for being false or lacking evidence/context. The changes below will allow minor strikes to be revoked if improvement is shown through the appeal.

> üîó **Form**: https://forms.gle/X486Y1ivNhGpNjAD8

These appeals are read on a daily basis by Senior Corporate+ in the Human Resources Department. They will decide whether your punishment can be revoked based on a certain standard and message you with the results.

To clarify, these are the two reasons why you should fill out a punishment appeal:
> :RedDot: **Demotions/Terminations**: You should fill out a demotion or termination appeal if you believe that you have been demoted or terminated falsely. This includes if the reason is completely false, there is a lack of context in the reason, or if there is not enough evidence behind your demotion/termination.
> :RedDot: **Strikes**: As of today, you can now appeal a strike **two weeks** after it has been given. In order for it to be removed, your appeal must show improvement and good effort.

This change goes into effect as of today. If you have any strikes that you believe you have improved from and it has been **two weeks** or more since it was given, you may now appeal for it to be revoked. Make sure to read all information located in the form before submitting.

:washiez: **Reminder:** In the training center, you should only be striking or failing during an ongoing training, **not before one.** You also should strike for valid reasons such as roaming, trolling, being disruptive or disrespectful. If any huge issues occur, whether it‚Äôs exploiting, discrimination or bypassing, you should call a BOD+ to deal with it. Strikes can be given using the :name command and failing another person should be done if they have 3 strikes or are not participating throughout most or the entirety of the session. @Supervision Team

:washiez: **New Grammar Policy**

Hello, everyone! The Chief Team has discussed modifying our current grammar policy. Due to a large number of strikes being handed out for lack of grammar, we have decided to remove the requirement. Please take a look at the in-depth grammar policy below.

üìå **Grammar Policy**:
> As of today, grammar will only be required in the **Training Center** for anyone with a role (Host, Co-Host, Trainers, and Spectators). Not using grammar will result in a strike. Grammar will not be required in the main game (car wash). We will not be handing out strikes for lack of grammar at the car wash, however, using grammar is encouraged when working and when speaking to customers. Anyone who uses grammar does get a boost when it comes to promotions as well. To summarize, **lack of grammar cannot hurt you, but using it is beneficial**!

If you have any strikes for lack of grammar in the main game, they will be ignored from this point on. You can appeal them if you wish to, but it is not necessary.

:blackExclamation: **Note**: Not using grammar does not excuse unprofessionalism. Strikes and other punishments will be handed out for anything considered unprofessional in both the Training Center and the car wash. We expect you to be kind, respectful, and appropriate in-game whether you are using grammar or not.

:washiez: **Rank Changes**

Hello, everyone! As you can see from the most recent announcement, we have some rank changes that have recently been implemented. This announcement will go into more specifics regarding these changes and how they will affect you all going forward.

:redArrow: **Rank Tiers**
> Low Rank -> Staff Team (Trainees - Head Operators)
> **(NEW)** Staff Leads (Shift Leaders)
> Middle Rank -> Management Team
> **(NEW)** Senior Management (Associate Directors and Board of Directors)
> High Rank -> Corporate Team (Corporate Intern - Head Corporate)

:redArrow: **Senior Management**
Our Senior Management team now includes both Associate Directors and Board of Directors. All of our previous Board of Directors have been ranked to Associate Director. Both of these ranks will moderate in-game with moderation commands. They will also have session and minute requirements.

The Human Resources Department has chosen our top **25** Associate Directors based on their overall activity and superiority to become Board of Directors. Please congratulate them below.

:washiez: **Management Team Applications**

Hello, everyone! I am happy to announce, on behalf of the Human Resources Department, that we will be opening applications for Junior and Senior Director. This new rank comes with more responsibilities and duties, so we will be choosing the most qualified applicants to take the **36** available spots we currently have. Junior and Senior Directors are a part of our new rank tier, **Management**, which includes a group of people who are entrusted with admin commands at the car wash. These individuals are also held to much higher standards by our Corporate Team. Please make sure to read through the requirements below before submitting an application.

üìå **Requirements**:
> :blueArrow: Applicants must be a **Supervisor or higher.**
> :blueArrow: Applicants must not have safechat.
> :blueArrow: Applicants must have a Discord account and be in this server.
> :blueArrow: Applicants must be able to be active on a daily basis.
> :blueArrow: Punctuation, grammar and detail are mandatory.

The closing date for these applications will be Sunday, October 2, 2022 12:00:00 PM. Any troll applications will result in a deletion of your application, and can put you at chance for consequences. This also goes for anybody lying about meeting the requirements given above. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to DM a Junior Corporate+ in the Human Resources Department.

Cooldowns will **not** be in effect for applications. Good luck!

Junior and Senior Directors have been moved up one rank as well. **For applications**, anyone who applies has the chance of becoming Junior OR Senior Director depending on application quality and experience due to the need to fill ranks.

:washiez: **In-Game Supervision**

Hello, everyone! The Human Resources Department has recently noticed many instances of AFK farming and improper supervising at the car wash. We have decided to confirm our rules regarding these scenarios to cut down on the number of punishments handed out. Please take the time to read through this announcement to avoid making a careless mistake when it comes to supervising the car wash.

**Minute Farming**
Minute farming refers to going AFK for long periods of time at the car wash or using certain techniques to bypass the idle kick feature. Going AFK for more than 20 minutes at a time will result in a **strike** while continuing to do so will lead to a demotion. Using techniques such as auto clickers or other cheating mechanics to bypass the "20-minute" idle kicker will result in a **demotion ** if caught. Sending little to no messages in a long period of time or not despawning any cars (Management Team+) during a shift will raise suspicions as well, so make sure to be actively working for the majority of your time at the car wash. Any punishments regarding AFK farming are up to the discretion of the Human Resources Department and there may be exceptions to what punishment is handed out.

> **Note**: Management Team members are more likely to receive more severe punishments for minute farming as they would be cheating their weekly requirements.

**Supervising Etiquette**
Currently, many of our Supervision Team members are making a habit of standing in the center of the car wash, remaining idle for long periods of time, and ignoring obvious problems going on in-game. As a Shift Leader+, you are expected to be walking around and helping those around you. Socializing and breaks are allowed, but when they are done primarily and begin to replace your supervising duties, that is when in-game issues are ignored. Anyone who does not follow these criteria will receive in-game reminders through PMs before being issued a strike for insubordination.

If you have any questions regarding these topics, feel free to DM a member of the @Human Resources Department. Thank you!

Congratulations, everyone! Wait momentarily as we work on ranking each of you. In the meantime, passers will be messaged by a member of the Human Resources Department shortly with more information regarding your new position. Please use the ``/getrole`` command in #commands in order to update your roles. If you did not pass this round of applications, we will continue to hire more Junior Directors as time goes on.

We will not be giving individuals any reasoning behind their failure due to the massive amount of applications. If you did not pass, please assume that your application's detail did not compare to others or that your activity did not uphold to others. Thank you and have a wonderful rest of your day!

Hello, everyone! As of today, any strikes will expire after two weeks of being sent. This means that they will no longer count against you. Any previous strikes from September 19th and back have now expired. If you have any demotions due to 3/3 strikes, the demotion will not expire.

This also means that we will be discontinuing our strike appeals for improvement as strikes will expire automatically rather than you having to send in an appeal. The punishment appeal form should only be sent out if you believe your punishment is FALSE.

If you have any questions regarding this, any member of the @Human Resources Department can assist you in direct messages or in a ticket ( #support ).

:washiez: **Talking in Photo Album**

Hey, everyone! Recently, a lot of discussions are taking in place in #photo-album. The Chiefs and I just want to remind you that photos should **__ONLY__** be in that channel. If you wish to respond to a photo, you can do so in #chat or #supervision-chat. From now on, if people continue to ignore this rule, you will face moderation consequences. Thank you for understanding. <3

:washiez: **Session Logging**

Hello everyone! We have recently updated the way that sessions will be logged!

:green_dot:Anyone logging a session in #session-logs should use the new format that I have posted. It can be found in the pinned messages of that channel. This format splits up users by the group they were in instead of the role they played at the training. Any corporate+ spectators can be logged in the "Corporate Spectators" section.

:green_dot:Any senior director+ that is logging a session on Hyra, should input usernames as they are shown on the session log. We have moved some things around and the log is sorted by group instead of what role you played at the training.

As always, if you have any questions, please make a ticket.

:washiez: **Behavior & Unprofessionalism**

Hello, everyone! Recently our Leadership Team has noticed many instances of unprofessional in both our chats and in-game. I am going to take some time today to clarify a few of our rules when it comes to unprofessional and the overall behavior of our Supervision Team+. **Keep in mind that these rules are enforced for ALL Shift Leader - Head Corporates**, no one is exempt from any rules regarding behavior & unprofessionalism.

:redArrow: **Jokes**
When making jokes to your friends, please consider those around you and whether others may be uncomfortable or take your joke the wrong way. As well as this, refrain from taking jokes too far or "overdoing" them in a sense. As an example, the many jokes regarding "furries" and the constant dog/cat noises can be joked about to a certain extent, but going too far and bringing them in-game can be considered unprofessional and out of line.

:redArrow: **Online Dating**
Any topics regarding online dating, virtual weddings, etc. should be kept out of our chats and game. Whether it is an inside joke or not, please keep anything that could make others uncomfortable in private.

:redArrow: **Inappropriate/Weird Topics**
All topics that could be considered inappropriate or weird to others should be kept in private/DMs. Please consider whether the conversation topic could make others uncomfortable or offended before starting the topic.

:redArrow: **Resignations & Punishments**
Any resignations and punishments should not be discussed in any of our chats. If a resignation has not happened yet, it should not be brought up publicly in our chats or game. Please keep any conversations regarding future resignations in DMs. As for punishments, any strikes, demotions, or terminations, should not be discussed whether it be with the person who received the punishment or not. We would like to avoid any unnecessary drama and dramatic tangents in our chats.

As well as this, I encourage each of you to read through one of our past announcements regarding some specific rules in #supervision-chat. It has been linked below.
> https://discord.com/channels/838853852374499392/982333383122247750/1006617884832841748

Now that this announcement has been made, our @Human Resources Department has been encouraged to hand out punishments if any of these discussion topics are brought up in the future. If you are unsure whether a topic is appropriate for #supervision-chat, you are more than welcome to message one of the department members or create a ticket.

We cannot wait to see all the pictures and themes throughout the week! Have fun, we appreciate you all!! You can find the theme for each day in the poster below.

:washiez: **Training Revamp:** Our last major update to the training procedure has just been released... a new Senior Operator guide! The outdoor area for the Senior Operators has been updated as well, go check it out! You can access the new guide in the training handbook. I'm not going to ping for this, so make sure everyone knows to use the new guide. I'll make an announcement within the next week that describes all of the improvements we have introduced this past month.

:washiez: **New Training Commands**

Hello, everyone! We have added some new commands to the Training Center to help you with dealing with disruptive Trainees - Senior Operators and other distractions. These commands have been explained below, make sure to read them thoroughly in time for your next training session!

:redArrow: !warn <player>
‚Ä¢ This command is available for anyone with a role at the Training Center. Using this command will give the individual an overhead "WARNING". **Warning someone for a second time will cause the overhead to be changed to "FAILED" and they will be spawned back to the lobby.** Anyone failed in the lobby will not be able to return to the current training and will be kicked by a Junior Director+.

**Note**: You can only give warnings to one person at a time. For example: !warn all will NOT work.

This command can be used for Trainees - Senior Operators who are:
‚Ä¢ Trolling
‚Ä¢ Disrespectful
‚Ä¢ Roaming
‚Ä¢ Not Following Directions
‚Ä¢ Disruptive

:redArrow: !unwarn <player> and !unfail <player>
‚Ä¢ This command is available for the Host and Junior Director+. It will remove any effects of the warn command. These two commands are interchangeable and both do the same thing.

These commands are now available at the Training Center! If you have any questions, feel free to make a ticket using #support to speak directly to a Corporate.

:washiez: **Reminder:** Hello everyone! As a reminder, we have a specific protocol for choosing host as of right now. When choosing a host, it should not be your first instinct to send a recording or have a Corporate choose for you based on said recordings. The proper way to choose host is to have a mature discussion with everyone involved and choose the best option for host based on their total trainings attended/hosted and if they claimed on-time. **Corporates should only be asked to make the final decision if no one is chosen after 10 minutes of discussing.** As well as this, anyone below Corporate Intern should not take authority during a host discussion. You can make proper points and move the discussion along, but you should not make final decisions that others have not ultimately decided alongside you. We hope to find a better way of claiming host in the future, but for now, please try to discuss rather than calling for a Corporate or depending on recordings. I have attached an announcement made back in August about this that many of you may not have been around to read at the time, so please take a look for more details on this topic! Thank you and have a great rest of your weekend! @Supervision Team @Management Team @Corporate Team

:washiez: **NEW: Team Selection Menu**

Hello everyone! The Leadership Team is very excited to announce the newest feature being added to the Training Center, the team selection menu! This will replace any current claiming methods and practices as this addition is completely automated! Read through the following informational bulletins regarding this new system.

:blue_dot: This menu allows the Supervision Team to join a training server, select a role to run for, and be randomly chosen for that server's roles. Each rank has the ability to run for roles only their rank has access to. At XX:40, or twenty minutes before the session, users will be randomly added to the teams based on the selections made.

:red_dot: If there are open spots after the menu has randomized each role, you will be able to join the team by using the team selection menu until the session begins. At XX:00, the team selection menu can no longer be used.

:blue_dot: The claiming commands (!host, !cohost, etc.) have been removed. The menu will be used for all role claiming from now on. The **!ungroup** command can now be used only on yourself, while Corporates can use it for any individual. This will remove you from the team you are currently on.

We hope you enjoy this change and that it helps with unfair decisions, host fights, etc. Any bugs or questions can be forwarded to a member of the Corporate/Leadership Team through a ticket using #support.

While many of these accounts are just trollers, some are spreading dangerous rumors through their bios and chats. The current problematic accounts have been listed below. If you see any new accounts, please contact a member of the Operations Department through our #support system in order for them to be permanently removed from our games. We want Washiez to be a pleasurable experience for all, so do not hesitate to get in contact if you have any issues with fake accounts or harassment through our games.

Thank you all for attending mass trainings!

It's been a blast and we hope you all had loads of fun! We are very open to suggestions on what should be included in these mass trainings which we will attempt to host monthly.

> 
> :red_dot: We will also be announcing mass trainings a couple of days beforehand, once we have a date and time finalised. 
> 
> :red_dot: Regarding timezones, we will try to select a time that is suitable for the majority. In addition, we will be avoiding all session times so more of you are able to attend!

:washiez: **Addressing Recent Issues**

Hey, everyone! Following recent events, I wanted to put a reminder out to everyone. **This may not include you, but please read the full announcement.** As you know, the Public Relations Department has recently brought five individuals into the department. Two of them were corporates, one was a Head Director, and the final two were Senior Directors. A lot of hate and negativity has been directed towards multiple people who were promoted, and I wanted to clarify it. Before Senior Directors were chosen, ALL Head Directors had a chance to join the department and had priority. We chose who we thought was fit for the department, and everyone had the same opportunity. Our new members have been doxxed, harassed, and bullied for just being in the department. I wanted to let you all know that this will not be tolerated, and if we find out you are being hateful towards anybody in Washiez, you will be immediately removed from the community. You all are old enough to be mature, so there is no reason to act like this. If you are one of the people who have been toxic to anyone in this community, please grow up. At the end of the day, it is Roblox and this will not matter a few years from now. It is extremely childish and shows who you are as a person. Washiez is supposed to be a safe community where everyone can come together, and it is not that right now. 

Before being malicious to someone, try being on the receiving end of it. Please treat others the way you would like to be treated. You never know what someone is going through in their personal life. If someone you know is participating in the toxicity, do not be afraid to report it, even if it is one of your friends. It is the right thing to do, and staying quiet causes you to be half of the problem. **If you ever need help with something/someone to talk to, Washiez related or not, I am here for each and every single one of you.** I do not want to see another issue like this again. Please react when you have read the full announcement. Thank you!

Hey, everyone! The Public Relations Department is ecstatic to announce our final event for the weekend. This event will be a comedy night, and it will begin in five minutes. When it is time to start, more information is given. In addition, **please stay on mute unless you get permission to talk.** I can‚Äôt wait to see all the jokes you guys can tell!

:washiez: **Staff Appreciation Week Conclusion**

Greetings, everyone! As the weekend comes to an end, the Public Relations Department would like to thank you all for participating. Our team had tons of fun over the weekend, and we hope you did too. If you weren't able to participate, don't worry; we'll have more staff events in the near future. Besides that, as the theme of the weekend is staff appreciation, I would like to thank you all for your hard work. Each and every single one of you contribute to how Washiez is as a whole, and our team could not thank you enough. With all of the activity shown from you guys, remember that it is healthy (and likely needed) to take a break every once in a while. Whether you take a few days or a few weeks; Washiez will still welcome you back whenever you are ready. With school coming up, it will be stressful to try and get a healthy balance between the two. Please do not choose Washiez over your in real life tasks. It is important to prioritize both your mental health and anything IRL over a virtual game. As I've said before, if you need anyone to talk to, you can always come to me. I appreciate all of you not just as someone who works at Washiez; but as a person. A collage of photos from over the week will be given below. Hope to see you all soon!

Therefore, HRD would want to stress that you rejoin during shifts to make sure that your minutes are logging as if you happen to go on an extremely long shift and your minutes didn't log, it's really difficult for you to prove that you have been down at the carwash.

:washiez: **Game Update** 

Hello everybody! With the recent game update, we‚Äôd like to turn the cafe into an active and fun place. A few things need to change in order for this to happen.

First, spend time at both the car wash **and** the cafe. Make an effort to remove blockers, handle disruptive customers, and answer questions. As a leader of our group, it‚Äôs your responsibility to establish the cafe as a fun place for customers and staff to visit. 

Second, cars **need** to get through the car wash in order for us to have a steady flow of customers at the cafe. The cafe is positioned at the exit of the car wash. Long blockages that prevent cars from getting washed cannot happen. Staff will leave the cafe to work somewhere else if we have this problem.

Our staff members look up to you. By setting an example for them, you can help the cafe succeed. Thank you for everything!

:washiez: **Testing Session**

Hey guys! We‚Äôre providing an opportunity for the *Supervision* and *Management Team* to find bugs in the cafe. Join one of the private servers and help us test. Each server will be overseen by a member of the Leadership Team. We need people constantly making orders, serving at the windows, and ordering at the registers. 

The only way we can fix the issues with the cafe is if we know **exactly** how the bug is caused. Your report becomes useless if you can't provide steps on how it happened. Please work **collaboratively** and communicate with others.

This is an example report of a bug that has already been fixed. 
*If a player leaves while the items for their order is going through the conveyor, the bag comes out and is unable to be collected*

Once you have found a bug, report it in #deleted-channel with a clear description of the issue and evidence. We're **not** able to fix the issue if your steps cannot be replicated. Any questions can be directed to the overseer of your server. Thank you!

Minute farming is not tolerated. This includes using an autoclicker to bypass Roblox's 20 minute auto-kick -- being caught doing so will result in a consequence.

__Behaviour at Other Groups:__
Please keep in mind that as a staff member here, you are representing Washiez. This means that being disruptive i.e. trolling, breaking rules of other establishments should not be occuring. Being caught doing so will result in a consequence depending on its severity. Feel free to refer to the previous announcement here. https://discord.com/channels/838853852374499392/982333383122247750/1004506462543941653

:washiez: **Safechat Verification:**

Hello, General Managers! Effective immediately, if you wish to become eligible for Junior Director, you must undergo our safechat verification process. You will notify a Corporate from HRD to join you in-game to verify that you have safechat disabled. To do so, you can simply DM them and wait patiently for their response. Please do not spam ping or flood their DMs upon reading this announcement.  Thank you!

:washiez: **Reminder:** Hey, everyone! To reinforce a rule that we've had, if you disconnect or leave with a role prior to the session commencing, you are not guaranteed to have your role returned to you if you rejoin the same server. However, those who are caught staying past role selection to 'steal roles' will be issued a punishment. If you need to rejoin the server for a reason such as glitched camera, getting guides, etc. please notify a Corporate in-game to hold the role for you. You can refer to the training guide in #supervision-information.   @Supervision Team @Management Team @Corporate Team

** :washiez: Reminder:** As a reminder, you are expected to leave after trainings. When trainers stay behind, the server stays slocked which causes issues for later sessions and confusion amongst staff. We do not wish to see any more individuals staying behind after trainings have concluded from now on, thank you!  @Supervision Team @Management Team

:washiez: **Answering PTS calls**

Hey, everyone! Recently, it has been brought to our attention that several of you are purposely avoiding PTS calls before a session by going AFK. Please keep in mind that since you have decided to attend the session, you are expected to perform your responsibilities and answering PTS calls prior to the session is a part of your responsibility. From now on, please see this announcement as a reminder to be actively answering PTS calls. Thank you!

:washiez: **Reminder:** Hello, I‚Äôd like to clarify and make it clear to you all that Supervision members should **NOT** be going on alliance visits (going to an alliance on behalf of Washiez). You can play the game obviously, you just cannot be asking for a photo and saying you are from Washiez. I know that there has been revolving confusion surrounding this, so I‚Äôm saying it now. Only Management members are permitted to go on alliance visits representing Washiez, which you should be doing so with good behavior as it reflects highly on us. The only time you should be going representing Washiez is when PR is hosting alliance visits. Thanks! @Supervision Team @Management Team

:washiez: **Reminder:** Hey! As a reminder, determining who passes and fails at the end of a training session shouldn‚Äôt be taking long. Trainings are not designed to be impossible to pass, and analysing every trainees chats is simply not necessary. Failing should only be considered in cases of clear trolling, or if they have been AFK for a prolonged period of time. In addition, you __cannot__ fail for incorrect trivia answers - simply correct them. Thanks!

If the bot reminds you, stop what you are doing and move on. Moderators will not be unmuting you anymore, follow the rules and for birthdays and promos, try not to spam the same message too much.

After selection, if you were not chosen for a role you should not be staying in the lobby, and should promptly leave when the host dismisses you.

:washiez: **Note:** Hello, @Staff Member. The topic of online dating, weddings and inappropriate conversations have been slowly creeping up again. Please read this announcement and familiarise yourself with it. From now on, moderators can and will moderate you for this as well as risk of losing your rank. The constant talk about online dating, calling people "hot" and "ekittens" is making a lot of people uncomfortable in chats. Keep these topics out of Washiez, you have your groupchats and dms for these jokes.

:washiez: **Note:** After talking to some people today, it is clear this needs to be a general announcement. Stop "ignore" pinging people with the clear intent for them to be scared of you "reporting" them. It creates an unnecessary atmosphere in chats and tries to show a power imbalance because they know you are about to report them. You can get someones name without having to ping them, don't be immature and create an unsettling atmosphere. HRD can punish if we see this being abused and creating unsettling atmospheres. @Supervision Team @Management Team

It‚Äôs a Management privilege and any visits you guys are hosting is unauthorized and against the rules which is reportable. So once more, please stop going on ally visits, it isn‚Äôt allowed as that‚Äôs a perk for Management+ only. This isn‚Äôt to be confused with simply going to the game, you can go to the game obviously but you shouldn‚Äôt be representing Washiez and making it an official ally visit.

:washiez: **Reminder:** This is just a reminder that no "Events" should be taking place in voice chats. Just because you claim it is unoffical, doesn't make it not an event. You do not have authority to take over a vc for a movie and expect people to not talk in those voice channels. Only people with authority to do so is PRD during events, thank you. @Supervision Team @Management Team

Hey, everyone! I am very glad to announce that the PR Department will be bringing back a very long awaited event many of you have wanted to return, which is the Washiez Olympics! This time around we will only be hosting it for Supervision Team+, **although Management+ will receive priority for spots**. We have a little over 200 spots available for this event if you're interested in participating. If you are wondering what the event is about, it will run for a week from **September 15th** to **September 21st**. Everyone is split into different teams, each one led by a different PR member and you earn points from winning events that are hosted throughout the week. Those who actively participate from the winning team with the most points at the end will share a prize of **3000 Robux**. If you want to sign up and are available, the form will be below, but **make sure to read all of the information on the form before signing up as not everything can be covered in this announcement**. Make sure any questions you have are answered on the form before asking PR. Thanks!!

:washiez: **SV+ Olympics Opening**

Hello, everyone! I am excited to announce the official onboarding to the Washiez Olympics. Below, a spreadsheet is linked, including the teams for the event and its official leaderboard. We tried to keep the sorting process as fair as possible, so please refrain from complaining about your team. Unfortunately, we could not admit everyone, but we have a waitlist prepared in case people do not attend. You will only be on the waitlist if you signed up beforehand, so do not ask for a spot. **You can, however, still join the server and cheer everyone on as a spectator if you are not on the list.**
  
Once you join the server, you will need to verify with Bloxlink. **If you are on the spreadsheet, you should submit a request in #team-request.** Once again, we remind you that this is an SV+ event, so **do not leak the server or any of its contents outside the SV+. All Washiez rules apply,** so please be considerate of those around you and have fun. Let the Games begin!

:washiez: **Washiez Trainings**

If you get a role, you should not be fighting about which group you get assigned to. Many people don't have the opportunity to train, and yet you are fighting over which group to train. Take the win of getting selected and train the group you are assigned to, or forfeit the role and have it reassigned to someone who will be happier training that group.
