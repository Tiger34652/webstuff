[01-May-20 10:16 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
don’t see why not if they are waiting for an HR to demote


[01-May-20 10:23 AM] Polk#1596
im pretty sure we allow people to spam kick cuff abusers or something like that as long as they have evidence, but that works too @RAMMGaming


[01-May-20 10:40 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Polk do we allow heads to do auto kick


[01-May-20 10:40 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
rain said that heads aren't allowed to lol


[01-May-20 10:41 AM] bman#0435
why wouldnt they be able to


[01-May-20 10:42 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
kick staff that is @bman


[01-May-20 10:42 AM] bman#0435
o dont they need perms from an hr


[01-May-20 10:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes yes that makes more sense


[01-May-20 10:44 AM] Polk#1596
there might have been a rule that only managements can kick staff once they have evidence and after they have put the evidence up on the management board


[01-May-20 10:45 AM] Polk#1596
but i really dont see why not heads can do the same


[01-May-20 10:45 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i thought anyone could do that aslong as they had evidence


[01-May-20 10:46 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
When I was a head it was kick only w/ permission.

[01-May-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
@Polk hi im getting a complaint abt u letting megan host a server when she wasnt in one and ik she asked doe but she should still be in a server before asking


[01-May-20 01:52 PM] bman#0435
also is anyone noticing seniors asking to host servers when they arent in one


[01-May-20 01:52 PM] bman#0435
i personally havent but fraux is saying he has


[01-May-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
from who exactly


[01-May-20 01:52 PM] bman#0435
fraux


[01-May-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
she asked and i needed hosts


[01-May-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
fraux got the second server


[01-May-20 01:53 PM] Polk#1596
why in the world is he complaining


[01-May-20 01:53 PM] Polk#1596
because of megan i got enough hosts


[01-May-20 01:53 PM] bman#0435
idk but he told me to refer to senior lounge and i saw this

[01-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
So...


[01-May-20 01:54 PM] Polk#1596
wait


[01-May-20 01:54 PM] bman#0435
apparently imag has been doing it too


[01-May-20 01:54 PM] Polk#1596
i gave 2 seniors 7th server


[01-May-20 01:54 PM] bman#0435
oop


[01-May-20 01:55 PM] bman#0435
but still, megan said she was at interviews and asked t host


[01-May-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
The thing is if she told Polk


[01-May-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
And knew


[01-May-20 01:55 PM] bman#0435
did she say she was at ins when she asked u polk


[01-May-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
If she said she was at int and he said it was fine because he needed hosts I don’t see an issue


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] Polk#1596
she asked if she could host trainings after interviews is done and i said yes


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] bman#0435
i kinda do. i mean we have the rule set out for this particular setting. its just more fair to be in the server and ask


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] Polk#1596
ok but bman listen


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
We don’t really enforce it tho because most of the time I’m asking seniors to hosts


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] Polk#1596
having enough hosts is more important


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
And I don’t get enough hosts


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
All the time


[01-May-20 01:56 PM] bman#0435
i didnt host the session so i dont have a problem with it but overall i think we should only allow them to ask if they are in the server, unless u ask and they say they can


[01-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying most the time I’m asking people to host and they have to pend


[01-May-20 01:57 PM] Polk#1596
HOLY THE 9TH SERVER IS ABOUT TO FORM


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] Polk#1596
OMG IT FORMED


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] Polk#1596
WHAT THE HELL


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
what does pending have to do with the asking thing tho


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
Have fun


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
9th server of what


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435

[01-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
Training


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] Beartikal#9760

[01-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve only gotten 8 servers


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
bonnie got 10 before


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
Well


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
i think our record is 10


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
not common


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that


[01-May-20 01:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
but 9 is like wow

Does it count if he got 50% on his checklist last week but then has done nothing so far this week


[01-May-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
That’s not activity improvement really


[01-May-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435

[01-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
Me


[01-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
She is the one who basically promoted me when she was a senior


[01-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
She did all the rules and all Kayla did was rank me


[01-May-20 02:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
i liked kizarr, never had any problems with her


[01-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 02:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-May-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
thanks bloo :D


[01-May-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
i think my previous record was 8


[01-May-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
so this is a big jump for me


[01-May-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
but maybe this just proves that bloxton will have more 10 server trainings this year..


[01-May-20 02:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think the one who will be closest to predict 1 million is tatto .


[01-May-20 02:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wait no Stacey maybe


[01-May-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591

[01-May-20 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591

Speaking of Leak


[01-May-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
I’m just not going to reply


[01-May-20 02:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
His activity is getting pretty decent lately


[01-May-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
I haven’t seen him


[01-May-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
Do any sessions


[01-May-20 02:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm


[01-May-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve only seen him do game nights


[01-May-20 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
That doesn’t count as activity


[01-May-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000
Has he actually been to the hotel or a session


[01-May-20 02:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep he did both

[01-May-20 02:57 PM] Cam#5887
overall causing drama again


[01-May-20 02:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not quite


[01-May-20 02:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can just suspend her for a longer duration


[01-May-20 02:57 PM] Cam#5887

[01-May-20 02:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Claire had the same situation and she was suspended for 2 weeks


[01-May-20 02:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not from drama but for being a bit inappropriate


[01-May-20 02:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok invite me @Cam


[01-May-20 02:59 PM] Cam#5887

[01-May-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435

[01-May-20 03:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so @Cam


[01-May-20 03:02 PM] Cam#5887
yo


[01-May-20 03:03 PM] Cam#5887
btw all of those screenshots are from that GC


[01-May-20 03:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so the first screenshot with purpeIy


[01-May-20 03:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was pretty rude to kenzi for quite some time


[01-May-20 03:03 PM] Cam#5887
Yup


[01-May-20 03:03 PM] Cam#5887
I noticed that


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I see here that people blocked Kenzi and still try to continue drama with her


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] Cam#5887
Tho Kenzi couldve taken the proper steps


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
They are feeding into it too


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't blame her for reacting this way, he refuses to leave her alone


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he even blamed her for his resignation


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] Cam#5887
yeah but from an MR, is that acceptable?


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
where r yall seeing this screenshot lol


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] Cam#5887
cause she couldve just blocked them


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] Cam#5887
or just said "Please stop."


[01-May-20 03:04 PM] Cam#5887
and then blocked


[01-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
In a gc


[01-May-20 03:05 PM] Cam#5887

[01-May-20 03:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 03:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idgi


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
thats why i didnt bring it to the top


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
what I see form is people that don’t like Kenzi are reporting her for something that’s a bit minor we can’t take action for then they feed into the drama


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
or bottom of the GC


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
cause thats not reportable at all

[01-May-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey o i only asked since theres no suspension card for her


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
These are people that are basically trying to get her fired


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] Cam#5887
mhm


[01-May-20 03:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-May-20 03:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Same


[01-May-20 03:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ye nothing wrong with it


[01-May-20 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
I was like ready for it to be really bad drama again to fire or suspend her


[01-May-20 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
But it’s nothing


[01-May-20 03:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it feels like they're setting her up


[01-May-20 03:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but fail to admit it


[01-May-20 03:09 PM] Cam#5887

[01-May-20 03:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-May-20 03:14 PM] Cam#5887

[01-May-20 03:14 PM] Cam#5887
theres another screenshot ig


[01-May-20 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
Are they seriously still looking for more evidence to try and get her fired


[01-May-20 03:15 PM] Cam#5887
seems so


[01-May-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
They really want her fired


[01-May-20 03:15 PM] Cam#5887
LOL


[01-May-20 03:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
i loved the time zone idea


[01-May-20 03:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
so much easier to tell who is what timezone


[01-May-20 03:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ALSO WE ARE ALMOST 15K AWAY


[01-May-20 03:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WE STILL HAVEN'T PLANNED SHIT


[01-May-20 03:16 PM] Cam#5887
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP


[01-May-20 03:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're really trying way too hard to get her punished @Cam


[01-May-20 03:17 PM] Cam#5887
ikr


[01-May-20 03:17 PM] stacey#1000
They are trying too hard


[01-May-20 03:17 PM] stacey#1000
I tell them we can’t do anything and now they are scrambling to find more evidence


[01-May-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
@RAMMGaming yes we need a party


[01-May-20 03:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
YES we need ideas


[01-May-20 03:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
If we can do 14 private servers that would be DOPE


[01-May-20 03:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
17*


[01-May-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[01-May-20 03:26 PM] stacey#1000
If we can’t get training private servers we can try to get at least 3-4 normal servers and plan something there


[01-May-20 03:30 PM] Cam#5887
this GC is such a joke


[01-May-20 03:30 PM] Cam#5887

[01-May-20 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
They are legit trying to get her in trouble for something her friends do....?


[01-May-20 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
That’s such bs


[01-May-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like a broken record telling them we can’t hold her accountable for someone else’s actions


[01-May-20 03:39 PM] Cam#5887
ive been rolling my eyes this whole time


[01-May-20 03:49 PM] Cam#5887
@stacey i think we pissed them off


[01-May-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
Probably


[01-May-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
But idc this report is a joke


[01-May-20 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
They don’t like Kenzi and for that reason they reported her for nothing


[01-May-20 03:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-May-20 05:57 PM] Polk#1596
trip said yes to this


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
well it is


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
lol


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
managers suggest heads to managers


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
they dont know that though


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
seniors suggest heads to manahers


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
it was an LR asking


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
well shes asking if its possible


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
and it is


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
i dont see a reason why she shouldnt know


[01-May-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
hm


[01-May-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
what i was about to say was


[01-May-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
trip might have been referring to the promotion suggestions channel since she is a management, not a senior


[01-May-20 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
but we keep the existence of every channel public, right?


[01-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
i think just sl


[01-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
but did trip explicitly say we have a chnanel where managers suggest other mrs to manager


[01-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
because if not i dont rly see a reason why "mrs suggest other mrs" wouldnt be said yes to


[01-May-20 06:01 PM] bman#0435
i mean its kinda knowledge that people recommend others


[01-May-20 06:01 PM] Polk#1596
wait what the hell


[01-May-20 06:01 PM] bman#0435
but thats my thought


[01-May-20 06:01 PM] Polk#1596
i just looked it up on questions but nobody answered the lr


[01-May-20 06:01 PM] Polk#1596
i thought they tried to report her but they were probably asking for her


[01-May-20 06:02 PM] Polk#1596
hm idk


[01-May-20 06:02 PM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming frog


[01-May-20 06:02 PM] Polk#1596
i always appreciate that some stuff stay classified to the public


[01-May-20 06:02 PM] Polk#1596
if possible that is


[01-May-20 06:03 PM] bman#0435
ya that channel should stay classified but the "mr suggesting other mrs" doent explicitly mean we have channels just to recommend them


[01-May-20 06:03 PM] Polk#1596
true


[01-May-20 06:03 PM] Polk#1596
but they are an LR


[01-May-20 06:04 PM] Polk#1596
they asked if mrs can recommend other mrs for a promotion


[01-May-20 06:04 PM] Polk#1596
so it has nothing to do with them, therefore i dont really see the point in saying yes


[01-May-20 06:37 PM] emma;#1525
It’s not a secret though


[01-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
We’ve said many times that most HRs only accept recommendations from MRs only


[01-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
We don’t need to hide everything just bc it’s “not relevant” to LRs


[01-May-20 06:49 PM] Polk#1596
ok but emma


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
since it isnt relevant to them


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
then what is the point in telling them about it


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
why should an lr know that mrs can suggest other mrs


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
managements cant even suggest mrs


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
i checked the promotion suggestion channel announcement you made, and you said they can only suggest LRs to head


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
so unless you changed that announcement


[01-May-20 06:50 PM] Polk#1596
managements arent able to suggest heads for a management promotion


[01-May-20 06:51 PM] Polk#1596
only seniors


[01-May-20 06:51 PM] Polk#1596
and im pretty sure we keep senior board promotion suggestions classified


[01-May-20 06:51 PM] Polk#1596

what was she fired for


[01-May-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
oh boy get ready for an announcement


[01-May-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
now people are leaking phone numbers in sl


[01-May-20 07:36 PM] bman#0435
.


[01-May-20 07:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds like a recipe for a termination @stacey


[01-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[01-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
she exposed personal phone numbers


[01-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
then


[01-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
she was acting like it was a joke


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Someone could contact these in the wrong hands


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
random question


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
so


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] stacey#1000
James actually did tho


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
just to keep this in perspective


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] stacey#1000
he legit messaged one


[01-May-20 07:48 PM] stacey#1000
but then deleted it


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
On the other hand


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
so i cant get the evidence


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
of it


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
we DIDNT fire whoever it was (blanking) for posting photos of his friend's face in SL


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I tried asking you guys about it


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
but we WANT to fire izzy for giving out a random person's phone number that she doesn't know


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
and that's fair... how... exactly


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
wait who sent photos of someones face


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mirk


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
.


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
By the way


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
I would vote fire for that


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
i didnt see that


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
Mirk sent photos of his IRL best friend's face in SL


[01-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hold on


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
ok can we revote on that


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
not anyone related to BH


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
wait whats wrong abt what izzy did


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let me give yall the bullshit responses he sent to me


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
trey


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
can we focus on this for a second


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
OHHH u blocked out the phone numbers


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
please


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
because if we totally dive back into mirk's case we'll ignore izzy's


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
because we have the attention span of squirrels


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
wait can one of u take over my int server


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
has it started yet


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
my parents r making me get off my computer


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
ok well if she doesnt get terminated she needs some sort of action


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
ye


[01-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525
sure


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fair enough but let's focus on Mirk after this


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] bman#0435
theyre abt to finish


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
ok so


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Anyways go on


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
we can make an announcement to all MRs not to post anyones personal phone numbers, snapchats, etc because many of them seemed to take it as a joke


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] bman#0435
nothing personal, whether its their private information or someone elses


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So what's your personal method on Izzy


[01-May-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
and izzy herself should be at least suspended and or/warned for her actions because she still exposed like 3 peoples personal phone numbers


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Omg I thought she exposed Mrs phone numbers at first


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I was about to say


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thing is


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] emma;#1525
my personal stance on the izzy case is that since it's a phone number she only got BECAUSE her personal info was given out by her friends, and someone decided to take advantage of that and text izzy's personal number even though it was a stranger, leads me to think that terminating her would be very extreme


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
and how about James, he actually messaged one of the phone numbers


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] emma;#1525
Because she doesn't know the kid and they only texted her bc they got a hold of her phone number without her consent anyways


[01-May-20 07:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We don't know their names either


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] emma;#1525
I mean james got that number the same way that random girl got izzy's number haha


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So idk what we can do it for


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] bman#0435
why do people even stan zoe 🤢


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
we should at least warn


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I would warn


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] emma;#1525
idek who zoe laverne is


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
because regardless if they are an MR or not


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or at the very least


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
she shouldnt expose anyones phone number


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] emma;#1525
yeah we defo need to put up an announcement about how they can't put ANYONE's personal info in, even with "permission"


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] bman#0435
some girl that shouldnt be stanned


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Remind her to be careful


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk who Zoe is either lmao


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] emma;#1525
even if they don't know them well


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
and can I make an announcement about not to post anyones personal phone numbers


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
or snapchats


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
or whatever


[01-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You should


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
ok ill do that


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
ill make a new vote


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
for izzy


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
still dumb for izzy to be posting random people’s numbers 🙄


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah it is


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A suspension and a termination?


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nah I don't think so


[01-May-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
I think she should get a 3 day suspension


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
its not as extreme as a terminaton


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
termination*


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
and it will allow her to learn her lesson


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
honestly Stacey that’s what I was thinking like at least have the decency to scribble out the numbers


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but instead she puts the numbers out there like have some common sense


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe but let's see what everyone thinks


[01-May-20 07:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I wouldn’t want my number to be posted in a random chat with people I don’t know


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know what my stance is ngl


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525
i feel like if izzy gets suspended she'll resign, since that's what she said in that gc with the ella problem 😂


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and the fact that James went to go text one of them 🤦🏻‍♂️


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525
i think a suspension is also a bit extreme, again *just* because that person texted izzy because they got her number without her consent so they already denied her privacy


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Gives us some room for a better worker lol @emma;


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525
but if y'all vote suspension, whatever


[01-May-20 07:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-May-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
ok idc if she gets warned or suspended as long as she gets some sort of punishment


[01-May-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Stacey


[01-May-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We should've warned kenzi!!!!! 😤


[01-May-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
I got distracted from it from the izzy thing


[01-May-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 07:58 PM] bman#0435
why


[01-May-20 07:58 PM] bman#0435
kenzi is such a problematic person


[01-May-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
its from jordan


[01-May-20 07:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What is it anyways


[01-May-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435
ya but did like proof of her being involved come up


[01-May-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
its not really about kenzi it just mentions her name


[01-May-20 07:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
???


[01-May-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 07:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sounds dumb lol


[01-May-20 07:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Give me the description


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
ok so im going to make a warning for izzy first


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
then an announcement


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
im doing that first


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
unless u want to do one


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
so its done faster


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think I wanna do izzy


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
ok so u write the warning letter and ill write the announcement


[01-May-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm more interested on seeing Jordan's report lol


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause part of me thinks we're gonna go through a repeat


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
it mentions kenzi's comments a bit in general discussion again


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
like her behaviour in general discussion


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
trey u dont wanna read it


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
lol


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
tbh its a bit excessive


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
bman she sent more


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
i-


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
ur joking right


[01-May-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
no


[01-May-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
what more does she have to add lol


[01-May-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
because I asked her what kenzi said


[01-May-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
for her to mention her name


[01-May-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
@emma; do u know if we both count a session on our cafd


[01-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
you count it as hosting, i'll prob count it as cohosting just since there were like 20 people left


[01-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
i can rank your second servers too if you can't get on computer for a while


[01-May-20 08:07 PM] bman#0435
ill be able to but u can if u want. my parents want me to do a gamenight with them so i had to cancel my training too


[01-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
did we ever make an anouncement telling MRs not to interrogate people with low account ages


[01-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
because lane is doing it rn


[01-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
and i thought we agreed not to let them do it anymore but i dont know if we announced it


[01-May-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
we didnt really talk about it much lol


[01-May-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
no we never announced it


[01-May-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
i forgot about it


[01-May-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
and people kept doing it at my sessions too


[01-May-20 08:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When did I say that @bman


[01-May-20 08:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
All I said that part of me thinks that Jordan is going to do the same thing as what we've dealt with today


[01-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
MOLLYLONGESTAL OR WHATEVER


[01-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
LITERALL


[01-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
KICKED A GIRL WITH PREMIUM FOR "LOW ACCOUNT AGE" 13 DAYS


[01-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
but not a NOOB WITH A FREE OUTFIT AT 15 DAYS


[01-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
this is why im against letting them do this


[01-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
im sorry but WHAT why does the girl with premium seem like a bigger threat lmao


[01-May-20 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
just make it an official rule not to question people and let those that pass, pass. if they get jobs to abuse they will just get fired and waste their own time


[01-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
yeah literally


[01-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
we dont even have *that* many CBs anymore


[01-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
i mean if meme and ava are gonna cb they've already shown they're smart about it


[01-May-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
people still manage to get jobs


[01-May-20 08:14 PM] emma;#1525
they can just do an app


[01-May-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
if they want a job to abuse, they can get fired and go through training all over again


[01-May-20 08:14 PM] emma;#1525
we dont age check those


[01-May-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435

[01-May-20 08:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@stacey i like megans uniform and she did a rly good job on it but i feel we should just leave it for the designer that baby and bear picked out. dont get me wrong, her uniform is good, but i think we should stick with the one they picked out


[01-May-20 09:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
For LRs


[01-May-20 09:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809

thanks xe


[01-May-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
ok well i have 2 things

1) how come when u host 2 servers it only counts as 1 server for the checklist

and

2) why is the maximum sessions now 12? like thats WAY more than the last checklists, as we would have to host x2 a day for 6 days. last checklist we would only have to host like 8 sessions to get to the 24 as we mostly get 3-4 servers now


[01-May-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003
but what do i do


[01-May-20 10:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
ill tell u when ive ~~finished~~ started* making the hosting guide


[01-May-20 10:09 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[01-May-20 10:09 PM] bman#0435
i feel like 12 is just overdoing it


[01-May-20 10:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809

im saying when u double host


[01-May-20 10:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
1) I thought it did count as 2, correct me if I'm wrong though.

2) No idea, it's the agreement Baby come to terms with.

You're better speaking to Bonnie about checklists cause he deals with activity/pay.


[01-May-20 10:10 PM] bman#0435
ya i asked bonnie about double hosting but he said it counts as 1


[01-May-20 10:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@bman like U personally host 2 servers?


[01-May-20 10:10 PM] bman#0435

[01-May-20 10:10 PM] bman#0435

[01-May-20 10:10 PM] xM_inn#2821

if female mr uniforms are getting skirts it would be cool if female hr uniforms could too


[01-May-20 10:27 PM] katie#0200
🤷‍♀️


[01-May-20 10:27 PM] stacey#1000
idk if they are getting a skirt tho


[01-May-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
Im cool with getting a skirt for female HR uniforms


[01-May-20 10:28 PM] bman#0435
cookie doesnt want one


[01-May-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
ok so we need to see who actually does and doesnt


[01-May-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
idc if its a skirt or pants tbh


[01-May-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
but skirt was my first choice


[01-May-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
@a. ღ skirt or no skirt


[01-May-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; skirt or no skirt


[01-May-20 10:29 PM] emma;#1525
No skirt Bc with R15 skirts don’t show up right anyways


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
o yea


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] emma;#1525
So I’d rather have well designed pants then a skirt split in half


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
i agree but i would love skirts ):


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] emma;#1525
I like what Megan designed


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
so maybe stick with pants


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
same


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] emma;#1525
I think for MRs if we did that with a white shirt and then maybe a blue logo?


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
but i want a dif color


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] emma;#1525
or even a black logo


[01-May-20 10:30 PM] emma;#1525
Like just remove the jacket part of it, kind of like the current hr and mr uniforms


[01-May-20 10:31 PM] emma;#1525
And then make MRs can have the blue pants, white button up with a blue or black tie


[01-May-20 10:31 PM] emma;#1525
And the blue or black logo


[01-May-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000
emma


[01-May-20 10:31 PM] stacey#1000

[01-May-20 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
put dress or something idk


[01-May-20 10:36 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey is the outfit megan designed like, pretty finalized for the female HR uniforms


[01-May-20 10:36 PM] emma;#1525
bc i'll include it for color reference in this form


[01-May-20 10:36 PM] emma;#1525
but if not then i wont


[01-May-20 10:36 PM] stacey#1000
I like it


[01-May-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
but some people brought up making it a darker blue


[01-May-20 10:40 PM] emma;#1525
this is harder than i thought


[01-May-20 10:40 PM] emma;#1525
bc theres so many potential combinations lmao


[01-May-20 10:40 PM] stacey#1000
yes lol


[01-May-20 10:43 PM] emma;#1525
idk why you cant format forms better


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey what are some options for specifically male and female uniforms


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
right now all i have is tie/no tie for male


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
so like


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
and heels/no heels for female


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
for females


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
i have all the colors in the "both" section


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
it can be dress


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
bc obviously they'll be the same color


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
or pants and blouse


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
i assumed pants and blouse


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
or skirt and blouse


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
uh does anyone actually want them to have a dress


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
no


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
bc personally i dont love that idea


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
put


[01-May-20 10:50 PM] emma;#1525
and if no one else does


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] emma;#1525
im not gonna give them the option lol


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] stacey#1000
let them vote on it


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] stacey#1000
put dress


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] stacey#1000
or pants and blouse


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] stacey#1000
or skirt and blouse


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] emma;#1525
stacey if none of us like a dress option anyways


[01-May-20 10:51 PM] emma;#1525
why would we even let them vote that


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
eh


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] emma;#1525
bc if they vote it and we already know we're gonna veto it i dont want to give them false hope


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
oh dont put dress


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
put


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] emma;#1525
i'll put skirt and pants


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
the pants and blouse


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
and yeah


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] emma;#1525
but im reminding them that R15 does not work well with skirts


[01-May-20 10:52 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] stacey#1000
and put different options


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] stacey#1000
for color schemes


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
I did


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
colors are all in one section


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
bc male and female need same color schemes


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
or it'll look weird


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
unless y'all want them to have diff colors


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
but i assumed we wanted them to be the same lol


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] emma;#1525
ok i'll show what i have so far


[01-May-20 10:53 PM] stacey#1000

thats why i made the google sheet


[01-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525
i prob should have specified a way to answer that


[01-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525

[01-May-20 11:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[01-May-20 11:25 PM] emma;#1525
ok i fixed the numbered ones rq


[01-May-20 11:26 PM] emma;#1525
the fact that multiple people voted for "royal blue and black" as a good color combo


[01-May-20 11:26 PM] emma;#1525
proves my point that we cant trust MR style choices


[01-May-20 11:26 PM] emma;#1525
LOL


[01-May-20 11:26 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[01-May-20 11:26 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[01-May-20 11:26 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[01-May-20 11:28 PM] emma;#1525
ikr


[01-May-20 11:28 PM] emma;#1525
you wouldn't even be able to see the logo


[01-May-20 11:32 PM] emma;#1525
ok so im gonna say my personal opinions for the uniform just cuz


[01-May-20 11:33 PM] emma;#1525
I like how mr/hr uniforms are similar but different


[01-May-20 11:33 PM] emma;#1525
So i think we should do blue pants and white shirt for MRs (idc if we do blouse for females that's fine) and then do a black logo, and a royal blue/light blue striped tie (like the one in the pic stacey posted earlier) for the male one


[01-May-20 11:34 PM] emma;#1525
and no heels for the female uniform


[01-May-20 11:34 PM] emma;#1525
and then the male/female uniforms would be the same BUT would have jackets


[01-May-20 11:34 PM] katie#0200
do u mean the hr uniforms would have jackets


[01-May-20 11:35 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[01-May-20 11:35 PM] emma;#1525
YES


[01-May-20 11:35 PM] emma;#1525
sorry lol


[01-May-20 11:35 PM] katie#0200
because if so i like that idea, we already do that if im not wrong and it’s pretty neat


[01-May-20 11:35 PM] katie#0200
lmao


[01-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i think that's what we agreed on too for HRs, i just also think we should have the MR uniforms be somewhat similar to ours


[01-May-20 11:36 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[01-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
they don't have to be tho, that's just my opinion but im not style expert lol


[01-May-20 11:37 PM] katie#0200
true i agree tho lol


[01-May-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
i agree


[01-May-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we look at other groups too


[01-May-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
they tend to have it the same way


[01-May-20 11:45 PM] bman#0435
ties should be for the hrs too

but can yall tell me if its too much or not kthx


[02-May-20 11:02 AM] bman#0435
Shes only been a head for around a month and a half, so saying “been an MR for a few months” is an overstatement. Between her time from her being a manager in the past to now, she wasn’t working here. Also, from an HR perspective, she is constantly reporting the smallest of things, thing that don’t even vioate stuff or meed attention. I personally disagree with this suggestion.


[02-May-20 11:03 AM] stacey#1000
sure


[02-May-20 11:04 AM] bman#0435

[02-May-20 02:52 PM] Cam#5887
so im assuming if anyone is playing inappropriate music its a ban


[02-May-20 02:52 PM] Cam#5887
bypassed audios


[02-May-20 02:52 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes ofc


[02-May-20 02:52 PM] Cam#5887
yeah ofc


[02-May-20 02:53 PM] bman#0435
what if people play loud/ear rape audios...


[02-May-20 02:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
idk about that


[02-May-20 02:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
there is an option to mute boomboxes


[02-May-20 02:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
so we can't ban for that


[02-May-20 02:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
if they play bypassed audio im pretty sure we can ban tho


[02-May-20 02:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause thats against roblox TOS


[02-May-20 02:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes


[02-May-20 02:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no ban for ear rape tho


[02-May-20 02:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
there is option to mute


[02-May-20 03:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[02-May-20 03:10 PM] ethan;#0003
We need to make some rules for the radio


[02-May-20 03:10 PM] ethan;#0003
no ear rape songs


[02-May-20 03:11 PM] ethan;#0003
no bypassed songs


[02-May-20 03:16 PM] Polk#1596
oh yeah


[02-May-20 03:16 PM] Polk#1596
i can make an announcement about that @ethan;


[02-May-20 03:16 PM] Polk#1596
like a bypassed song would result in a ban obviously


[02-May-20 03:17 PM] Polk#1596
but would just loud audio be a warning or a ban as well


[02-May-20 03:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes new rules


[02-May-20 03:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Polk also mention no cuffing w/ balloon


[02-May-20 03:19 PM] Polk#1596
alright


[02-May-20 03:19 PM] Polk#1596
noting all of these down


[02-May-20 03:19 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
bypassing music = bans


[02-May-20 03:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[02-May-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596

[02-May-20 03:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Trey you already did that


[02-May-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
should we allow staff to use the boombox as well while on-duty?


[02-May-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
i dont see why, but i dont see why not


[02-May-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
in my opinion


[02-May-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
they can use it


[02-May-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
tbh the balloons + security is ASKING to be abused


[02-May-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
but not if they are like giving a room or something


[02-May-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
or giving snacks at the bar


[02-May-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
ikr


[02-May-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal is it possible for u guys to make it so that when security cuffs someone and they take the balloons out it takes away their jump?


[02-May-20 03:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
ya it is


[02-May-20 03:46 PM] ethan;#0003
@Polk can u make in the rules for new items that staff shouldnt hit people with the pillows


[02-May-20 03:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[02-May-20 04:59 PM] Polk#1596
hmm


[02-May-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk cant people mute the radios if the audio is loud


[02-May-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
like there is a mute radio option


[02-May-20 05:01 PM] Polk#1596
they can mute


[02-May-20 05:01 PM] Polk#1596
but what if


[02-May-20 05:01 PM] Polk#1596
some people are playing an audio


[02-May-20 05:01 PM] Polk#1596
and another person runs into them with earrape


[02-May-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000

[02-May-20 05:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[02-May-20 05:20 PM] a. ღ#4222
@stacey did u want skirts as the female uniforms


[02-May-20 05:20 PM] bman#0435
since he was given his second inactivity notice 💀


[02-May-20 05:20 PM] bman#0435
he only went to 3 real sessions


[02-May-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
no we arent getting skirts because they look really bad in r15


[02-May-20 05:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
how do they look bad


[02-May-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
they look more like pants


[02-May-20 05:22 PM] a. ღ#4222

[02-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000

[02-May-20 05:23 PM] a. ღ#4222
ok


[02-May-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
storty in r15 the legs dont connect


[02-May-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
and animations would make a gap between the legs


[02-May-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
lol


[02-May-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
so it would lok like shorts

[02-May-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000

[02-May-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
because of it


[02-May-20 05:26 PM] Polk#1596
could u explain why you disagree @RAMMGaming


[02-May-20 05:26 PM] Polk#1596
on the loud audio one


[02-May-20 05:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
OH I SEE


[02-May-20 05:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
ok


[02-May-20 05:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He wants to play his own @Polk


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
There is an option to mute it


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Polk


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they own it


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and they wanna hear their music


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then they cant if they needa mute someone elses


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
what noob @xAfroTrey


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
yes ramm


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
but let's say


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
someone is having a party


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
then someone runs in with earrape audio


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but not everyone is gonna do that


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Idk I guess I’ll change my vote


[02-May-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
but for the people that do


[02-May-20 05:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
A ban is a bit extreme for spending 250 on a game pass


[02-May-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
do we have a choice if they abuse it though


[02-May-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If they abuse it, that's their fault


[02-May-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
After all


[02-May-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's against tos and they know they're fucked


[02-May-20 05:41 PM] Polk#1596
exactly


[02-May-20 05:41 PM] Polk#1596
they can play any audio as long as it isnt bypassed, inappropriate, or super loud earrape


[02-May-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The moderation is shit but we should at least follow the tos


[02-May-20 05:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A warning isn't going to do shit


[02-May-20 05:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Btw


[02-May-20 05:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did yall see venti reach 3k already


[02-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
@everyone


[02-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
you can ONLY ban for innapropriate bypassed Audio on the Retro Boombox


[02-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they play Earrape, you just just use the Mute Boomboxes button


[02-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
do not ban for earrape


[02-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
boomboxes kinda add some new rules to put out


[02-May-20 05:48 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
can we give 3 warnings and a kick


[02-May-20 05:48 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
for refusal


[02-May-20 05:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
for ear rape but never ban unless its a Bypassed music


[02-May-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
what about staff using balloons to jump and around


[02-May-20 05:48 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ok sir


[02-May-20 05:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
@ethan; i mean thats trollers


[02-May-20 05:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
like if they do it to run away from cuffs


[02-May-20 05:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
i mean


[02-May-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
becus i dont think staff should be warned for jumping with the balloons


[02-May-20 05:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah i dont care about that


[02-May-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
because they can only jump outside


[02-May-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know about that chief


[02-May-20 05:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I rather do both


[02-May-20 05:56 PM] Polk#1596
ok loud audio 3 warnings?


[02-May-20 05:57 PM] Polk#1596
wait uh


[02-May-20 05:57 PM] Polk#1596
do you think staff should be warned for jumping around the hotel with the balloons without any reason whatsoever or no @Beartikal


[02-May-20 05:58 PM] Polk#1596
it is up to you and baby but most of the hrs agreed on saying it is a warning


[02-May-20 05:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[02-May-20 07:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
@RAMMGaming you CAN ban for innapropriate audio


[02-May-20 07:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
bypassed


[02-May-20 07:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
etc


[02-May-20 07:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
@RAMMGaming


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
remember how those exploiters were lagging that server


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
i found out how they did it


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
patch coming tonight xd


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
howwww


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
also how did they do personalized kick messages


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
good question


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
that shouldnt be possible


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill find out


[02-May-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
ight


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
alright so


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
kinda scary how they can go above superadmin


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
YOU were kicked with that message right?


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
ramm was


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
alright i found out why


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
that kick message is suppose to display on exploiters only who abuse the system so in reality they didnt write that message


[02-May-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
i did


[02-May-20 07:15 PM] bman#0435
ohhhhhh


[02-May-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
fixed it now


[02-May-20 07:15 PM] bman#0435
i thought the exploiter wrote the message LOL


[02-May-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
i like to troll them back what can i say


[02-May-20 07:15 PM] bman#0435
👍🏻


[02-May-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
i deleted the script now as Roblox patched the exploit so it's useless


[02-May-20 07:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
to keep


[02-May-20 07:16 PM] bman#0435
gg


[02-May-20 07:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
also spammers


[02-May-20 07:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
they spam right


[02-May-20 07:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
but are their spam messages just copy and pastes


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
or do they like


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
make it so that its like this


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
```ban me```
```ban me.```
```ban me```


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
notice the period


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
on the 2nd


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
they probably do that to bypass the anti spam script we have


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] bman#0435
they copy and paste


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] bman#0435
100%


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
should ban them when they copy and paste the message > 4 times


[02-May-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
kick*


[02-May-20 07:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
if it doesnt work ill fix it


[02-May-20 07:18 PM] bman#0435
tbh i dont even go to the hotel anymore since the trollers/exploiters ruin the fun


[02-May-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435
no one wants to deal with them and they think what theyre doing is funny but its just annoying


[02-May-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435
one of the cbs made an hr rate list and i got a 0/10 since i always ban them 💀


[02-May-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760

please update rules and info with the new rules stated in announcements on the bloxton server, pls and ty @RAMMGaming


[02-May-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
also all staff can use all tools


[02-May-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
as long as they are on task


[02-May-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
and working


[02-May-20 07:47 PM] ethan;#0003
what about staff just using the spray bottle


[02-May-20 07:47 PM] ethan;#0003
randomly


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] ethan;#0003
becuase people never use it to roleplay cleaning


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] ethan;#0003
just to spray other people


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
they can but if they are trolling then no


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming add this stuff bear said also


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] ethan;#0003
wait idk if that would go under rules


[02-May-20 07:48 PM] ethan;#0003
🤔


[02-May-20 07:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ill add in a bit


[02-May-20 07:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Beartikal yo the kids username was me_lagserver LOL


[02-May-20 07:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Polk CAN YOU DM the new rules?


[02-May-20 07:56 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal what about for staff who own gamepasses like the suite and penthouse, there is a rule that doesnt let them take out rooms


[02-May-20 07:56 PM] ethan;#0003
so they cant use the gamepasses


[02-May-20 07:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[02-May-20 07:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they fly around with a guest we cant fire them?


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
if they have balloons out


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
when they are cuffing someone


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
and jump


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
and fly up


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] Polk#1596
yes


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
then thats cuff abuse


[02-May-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435
^


[02-May-20 08:00 PM] bman#0435
lol


[02-May-20 08:00 PM] bman#0435
its worse than jumping with them


[02-May-20 08:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think we should suspend someone if they jump while cuffing someone


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] ethan;#0003
becuse they can do it on accident


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
nono


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
jump on purpose


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
on accident is fine


[02-May-20 08:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but like


[02-May-20 08:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
jumping in circles


[02-May-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
like juming around in circles just to cuff abuse


[02-May-20 08:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[02-May-20 08:02 PM] Polk#1596
well ethan


[02-May-20 08:02 PM] Polk#1596
i also thought of it as cuff abuse


[02-May-20 08:02 PM] Polk#1596
but baby said


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so we cant fire


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
this aint ET tho...


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Polk#1596
"if its a troller who cares wha they do with them lol"


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Polk#1596
he just thinks


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Polk#1596
if they cuff an innocent perseon


[02-May-20 08:03 PM] Polk#1596
its cuff abuse


[02-May-20 08:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait wut


[02-May-20 08:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[02-May-20 08:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what if it isnt a troller?


[02-May-20 08:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o wait


[02-May-20 08:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[02-May-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
what abt housekeeping tho


[02-May-20 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
housekeeping


[02-May-20 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
is


[02-May-20 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
useless


[02-May-20 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
sorry


[02-May-20 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
i had to say it


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Polk#1596
bonnie suggested we do :m


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Polk#1596
but like


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Polk#1596
idk


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] ethan;#0003
too annoying


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] ethan;#0003
mrs would use it too much


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
they can use m


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
because like bartending is not on all the time


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Polk#1596
yes my exact thoughts


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
and when they join a server people wouldnt know


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
pm all


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
?


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
thats worse


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they do


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
:m


[02-May-20 08:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
if they use m, they should only be using it the same amount as they would h.


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they can click it and it would go away


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so its not that big a deal i dont think


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Polk#1596
pm all isn't a bad idea


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Polk#1596
it doesnt cover the whole screen


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Polk#1596
its a little message on the bottom right


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
I dont see the problem with them using m


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but if they


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
pm


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
not everyone would read the pm


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and they dont open it


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Pm all-


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Wtf


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre gonna have like  a billion pms


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so i think :m is better


[02-May-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they dont wanna see it they can just click it and it goes away


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
M will go away in 10 seconds


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Polk#1596
personally i think the m message is too big :shrug:


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
can we vote on it


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Polk#1596
it would be nice if we had this feature


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
If ur that fussed of it being overused then make a rule that Mrs can use :M once ever x minutes


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its the same as :h but in a diff spot


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Polk#1596
that mrs could write a command


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Polk#1596
and it would show up at the top but its scripted


[02-May-20 08:17 PM] Polk#1596
ok


[02-May-20 08:18 PM] bman#0435
what if we get baby and bear it script a recurring message for it


[02-May-20 08:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Add temp bans!!


[02-May-20 08:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Polk 5


[02-May-20 08:19 PM] Cam#5887
MY BAD FOR TALKING IN ANNOUNCEMENTS


[02-May-20 08:19 PM] Cam#5887
I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS ANNOUNCEMENTS


[02-May-20 08:19 PM] Cam#5887
XD


[02-May-20 08:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Doesn't matter


[02-May-20 08:19 PM] Polk#1596
vote instead of tagging noob


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
well


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
we also need some sort of rule if there is more than one MR in a server they cant all be using M every 2 mins


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
preferably nobody should speak in there


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
because the channel was made


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
like they cant announce housekeeping 2 mins after a diff MR announces bar


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
not to have announcements flooded


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oooo that would be a better solution @bman


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut if


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
baby and bear added like a thing on the side for announcements


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
i said that earlier bman


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk if that would work tho


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
it would be nice if we had a script that replaced the h command


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
but..


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
it depends


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
then why don’t we ask


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
@bman the only issue with that is if like they announce bar from a script and there is no bartenders on it wouldnt work


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Polk#1596
if baby and bear is up to it!


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg


[02-May-20 08:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut if

[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Polk#1596

[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that went on tvs


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
@Bloo_Berriez pretty sure theyre only concerned abt the m message but wtvr lol


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that would be cool


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
polk


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
what about what I mentioned


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
if there is a recurring message


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and then they could just put small tvs in the hotel lobby and outside etc


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
that goes off every so often


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
and there is no bar on


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
whats the point in that


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Polk#1596
yes


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Polk#1596
only shout


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
@stacey they already have somethinf for bar, and for bar they have rhe selfserve. im talking abt housekeeping since bar is technically already announced


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] Polk#1596
if someone is actively working at that station


[02-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
but what if there isnt housekeeping on


[02-May-20 08:22 PM] stacey#1000
and how about if bar just joins the server

[02-May-20 08:22 PM] bman#0435

[02-May-20 08:26 PM] Polk#1596

[02-May-20 11:19 PM] stacey#1000
about darren not announcements


[02-May-20 11:19 PM] stacey#1000

[02-May-20 11:19 PM] stacey#1000

[02-May-20 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
im fixing the jetskis


[02-May-20 11:19 PM] stacey#1000
I think we should wait for Katie to see what darren messaged her and what she personally thinks


[02-May-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
shes the one who was talking to him regarding this


[02-May-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman premium payouts work when premium players play your game and 2) the longer they stay the better


[02-May-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
gamepasses earn significantly more its more of a bonus


[02-May-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
even tho its still immature of him to all of a sudden be so scared of me and not choose to discuss it with me


[02-May-20 11:20 PM] bman#0435
i got 5 premium payouts and im expected to get 9 LOL


[02-May-20 11:20 PM] bman#0435
woooooooooo


[02-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525

[02-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525
especially with leak having his position


[02-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525
i know y'all dont like darren (trust me i RELATE)


[02-May-20 11:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
leak is more active than him atm which is kinda sad 💀


[02-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525
but it's not fair to demote him but not demote leak when darren's been MORE active than leak


[02-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525
no hes not trey


[02-May-20 11:23 PM] emma;#1525

[02-May-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000

@katie when u are online I want to hear your opinion on darren, he has enough votes to demote but i understand he spoke to you regarding this instead of myself so I want to hear about that and your stance on it

[02-May-20 11:57 PM] stacey#1000
@bman mk so if he is getting demoted u can do it but pls wait to allow katie to explain what darren discussed with her


[02-May-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435

i also wanna get more hr opinions


[02-May-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
considering 5 is not even half and a demotion from senior is pretty big


[02-May-20 11:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@stacey hold up hold up


[02-May-20 11:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Why not demote like every other MR we do with inactivity?


[02-May-20 11:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
just demote a rank like we do with other MRs


[03-May-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
i thought we demote for their lr ranks


[03-May-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
*to


[03-May-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
yeah demote is what im getting at


[03-May-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000

**2nd HR**: user was HAUway, we caught him  selling ranks in Hilton and eventually got banned of Roblox.


[03-May-20 12:06 AM] stacey#1000
rip


[03-May-20 12:06 AM] emma;#1525
idk I just feel like demoting darren is largely being influenced by everyone's personal biases against him


[03-May-20 12:06 AM] emma;#1525
and not necessarily because any of us believe it's what's right (just based off of how we've handled these situations before)


[03-May-20 12:06 AM] emma;#1525
y'all know im the first person to say i dont like darren


[03-May-20 12:06 AM] stacey#1000
this is why im waiting to hear from katie


[03-May-20 12:06 AM] emma;#1525
but this just screams "we dont like him and are using this as a reason to get rid of him" to me


[03-May-20 12:07 AM] stacey#1000
because darren actually discussed this with her


[03-May-20 12:07 AM] Beartikal#9760
damn and the first staff i hired was QBN_Flow, account also terminated


[03-May-20 12:07 AM] stacey#1000
rip


[03-May-20 12:09 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey also just my personal opinion but for demoting someone with as big of a rank as senior, i'd like to see way more than 5 votes for it before we say it's good enough for a demotion


[03-May-20 12:09 AM] Beartikal#9760
ya'll i think im gonna cry

I think at least 10 should agree


[03-May-20 12:09 AM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal TICKETS omg


[03-May-20 12:09 AM] stacey#1000

[03-May-20 12:10 AM] Beartikal#9760
we bid that when we first opened and it looks like we bid 2.5k robux


[03-May-20 12:10 AM] emma;#1525
but you said we have enough votes to demote technically which yes is true and i also want to know what katie says BUT i think we should wait for at least 10 HRs to agree before anything happens


[03-May-20 12:10 AM] Beartikal#9760
10 robux = 1 ticket


[03-May-20 12:10 AM] emma;#1525
if that's what people are wanting


[03-May-20 12:10 AM] stacey#1000
omg


[03-May-20 12:10 AM] stacey#1000

[03-May-20 12:10 AM] emma;#1525
i never used tickets


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; honestly this is a decision im stuck between


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] Beartikal#9760
sad


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
i totally get that everyone is upset with darren


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
but we let fraux have 0 inactivity for a year


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
and we're considering him for shift basically


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
darren has like


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
10% activity for 5 months


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
and we're saying demote?


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
im sorry but that shows how biased this is


[03-May-20 12:11 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[03-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
brkal


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000

[03-May-20 12:12 AM] Beartikal#9760
hi


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
LOL


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
gg


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
yeah but stacey i just think people will vote yes and not think much about it lol hence why i want to wait for more votes


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
which if you're fine with


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
it's not an issue


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
@emma; we only kept fraux since he had a valid excuse lol


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
not having access to a computer is not a valid excuse when we have seniors hosting on mobile


[03-May-20 12:12 AM] bman#0435
darrens is "i-"


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
but we let it be a valid excuse because we like fraux


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
lmao


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Emma makes a very very valid point


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
I mean


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] bman#0435
u were defending fraux for that tho


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
my stance is he has been doing stuff right


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

yeah i was because im biased towards fraux and i can admit that


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] bman#0435
so u basically saying we were favoring fraux


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] bman#0435
lol


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
his attitude and the way hes been handling things


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
but im fighting FOR darren now too


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
yes we wer


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what should our option be if we disagree


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
100%


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
we were


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
i was too


[03-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
i'll be honest with that


[03-May-20 12:14 AM] stacey#1000
this is a back and forth thing


[03-May-20 12:14 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I would give it a few weeks, wait send him a message, then see what he says then

***Resignation Due***


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
well here is the thing about that


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
I messaged him


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
2 weeks ago and got no response


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
i was hoping he would discuss it with me


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] ethan;#0003
he is at the hotel


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
Darren's resignation date being set should have 0 effect on our choice if I'm being completely honest


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
but hes also doing stuff


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
Because plenty of MRs do that, we just don't know about it


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
its just his attitude and way hes handling it that makes me upset


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
Yeah and that's understandable


[03-May-20 12:15 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I mean I have been inactive af and here I am


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] Beartikal#9760
guys im resigning in 2080


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
But is that a valid reason to fire him when HALF THE MR TEAM has behavioral issue


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] stacey#1000
but we cant demote him for that


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
issues*


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] stacey#1000
see emma I see your point


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] stacey#1000
hes not completely inactive


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
Idk I would just rather let Darren resign peacefully then fire him because we all are looking for excuses to get rid of him because we don't like him that much


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] Beartikal#9760
hi


[03-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
Because I don't think we can justify firing Darren if we didn't fire fraux or leak or any of the inactive heads that have been on the list for months


[03-May-20 12:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
because you suck @RAMMGaming


[03-May-20 12:17 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[03-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
bork bork


[03-May-20 12:17 AM] ethan;#0003
THEY ALL HAD LEGITIMATE REASONS


[03-May-20 12:17 AM] ethan;#0003
except leak


[03-May-20 12:17 AM] bman#0435
leak shouldve been demoted by now but min (sry for picking on u) has been slacking with demoting


[03-May-20 12:17 AM] Beartikal#9760

[03-May-20 09:39 AM] katie#0200
@stacey I personally agree with what Emma’s said. Here’s pics of my conversations with Darren about his inactivity. So the first two pics is his explanation that he sent to me out of the blue, then I questioned him about it a bit (3rd and 4th screenshot). when u mentioned demoting Darren a few days ago I advised him to message you but I didn’t think he’d just say “i”.. I thought he’d give a more open explanation and maybe a reason as to why he hasn’t responded to you but 🤷🏼‍♀️ to be honest it does look like we’re trying to get rid of him at this point.  even though he does have a set resignation date, like Emma said, it shouldn’t matter too much as long as he still does stuff here and there (when I talked to him he said he’s still planning to do shifts and host and stuff which is fine, i can pester him to do that a bit more if needed)

[03-May-20 10:36 AM] stacey#1000
@katie yeah I agreed with Emma more after discussing it. That’s why I brought it up because it was a really back and forth thing. He responded to you at least and is still doing stuff here and there. So I’ll inform him his activity thing is done or should you? He’s legit not even wanting to talk to me lol


[03-May-20 10:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

@xAfroTrey ok stupid bitch ass


[03-May-20 12:12 PM] bman#0435
tbh i dont rly see a point in keeping darren if katies just going to bug him to do stuff. he clearly isnt dedicated enough to keep his position and is just seeking attention by setting his resignation date in his bio 6 months ahead of time.


[03-May-20 12:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok idiot


[03-May-20 12:12 PM] katie#0200
i'm sure he'll do stuff on his own i just need to tell him to take this more seriously


[03-May-20 12:13 PM] bman#0435
also did he say why he used the pandemic as a reason lmfao


[03-May-20 12:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the problem is you shouldn't even need to tell him lol @katie


[03-May-20 12:14 PM] katie#0200
no i havent asked him yet ill do that soon but we cant just assume that it isnt affecting him in some way 🤷‍♀️ @bman


[03-May-20 12:14 PM] bman#0435
my mans went inactive before the pandemic was called a pandemic


[03-May-20 12:14 PM] bman#0435
i never said it wasnt affecting him but he went inactive before it was even identified as a pandemic...


[03-May-20 12:18 PM] katie#0200
oh true lol


[03-May-20 12:18 PM] katie#0200
i'll ask him about that then

We need new interview questions please if possible!!


[03-May-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ye that would be nice @stacey


[03-May-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
however


[03-May-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we need baby and bear to rescript the application center


[03-May-20 02:56 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[03-May-20 02:58 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder Is it possible for us to make up new interview questions. The ones we have are the same ones for awhile. I think with the update and hitting a million soon, new interview questions would be great. I know that would require re-scripting  the application centre but what do you think of the idea.


[03-May-20 02:58 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[03-May-20 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
This would eliminate copied answers for awhile as well.


[03-May-20 03:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Didn’t I think bonnie asked already @stacey

[03-May-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000
So we are allowed to eliminate 2 questions and no re-do any?


[03-May-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000
Not*


[03-May-20 03:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh I forgot what was said about it but I remember it was brought up about how we’re able to remove some to make new ones


[03-May-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000

[03-May-20 03:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-May-20 03:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what new questions could we ask


[03-May-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
I still like question 2 and 5


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
can we ask like


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
"how did u find this group"


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
But like the question 4 where it asks for you to rate your activity


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you know what would be fire


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Like I think we talked about how we could remove the last one and the activity one


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t see the point in that


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if we put the colored ranks in the training center and ic


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah and we can add that question in story brought up


[03-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000

[03-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000

> *** "The next day is when I can already feel in the pit of my stomach, it was unfortunately the end, a tragic and hurting end. I got told by Nicole as a “warning” that people were plotting against me. That there was a group chat. That they were reporting me. I instantly knew I was done in. It was as if my life flashed before my eyes. I felt sick to my stomach; I was scared, nervous, devastated, and sad. Everything but comfortable and happy I was at that moment. I spoke with Brianna, before I submitted my rushed resignation letter, I asked her if I should wait it out or just resign. She told me I would feel less humiliated if I resign now. I took her opinion into consideration, and you know what happened next. I sent in my notice. It was as if I was in a nightmare clicking “Leave Group” on Bloxton Hotels. I hate thinking back to that point. It makes me feel sick, even now. That was the end of my story, I was then blacklisted the next day by EmmaPendragon. It has been a long road, I can’t even lie. It has been bumpy and dreadful. But, here I am now."***

> ***"Having a chance to talk to many people and make new friends is a great opportunity. To have the Former role is to show that I have been in that position of seniority. I have worked the hours, days and nights. Spent countless-straining minutes of my life getting to that training session, or making time for that shift. I made it to something a lot of people can’t. As selfish as it might sound, I’m very proud of what I accomplished. Me, some random LR amongst the thousands. I made it to Head of Security. Being able to prove that I once was, to show that I have been there before as I have. I deserve the role as much as any other MR before me. I worked consistently and activiley. Everyday, there wasn’t one day in my entire LR - Head career I didn’t play Bloxton for at least one tiny shift for some reports. I was on every day. Getting promoted (Thank you, Katie) is an experience not many have experienced. I’m one of the people who did. I know I am ready now after 60 days to show you I am capable. Capable of something some people doubted. That is change. Change can happen, and showing that, even with the slightest boost may it be some Discord role. It might seem small. But, to me it means I haven’t done this journey for nothing. That there is light at the end of the tunnel. That I can prove to you that I am better than I once was. I am ready to prove that."***

@bonnie591 what about shifts per week?


[03-May-20 06:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Polk i think he wants you to jump off a bridge


[03-May-20 06:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Polk I have a question


[03-May-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk Yes what RAMM said


[03-May-20 06:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So are we banning users from the DC who fall under the age of 13 (including proof of being under 13 with safechat) or only if they **admitt** to it in the server? @Polk


[03-May-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
Like if someone has safe-chat on roblox, a lot of people do do we just ban them if we are aware they have safe-chat? Because there are some users that put safe-chat on the account by mistake. I've only banned users if they admit it on the discord, that's just what I assumed.


[03-May-20 06:39 PM] Polk#1596
Well yeah lol


[03-May-20 06:39 PM] Polk#1596
No kidding


[03-May-20 06:39 PM] Polk#1596
Hmm


[03-May-20 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
We don't know their actual age with safe-chat.


[03-May-20 06:40 PM] Polk#1596
Well, technically, if we know that they are below 13, we have to ban them


[03-May-20 06:40 PM] Polk#1596
But of course we would need valid evidence


[03-May-20 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
And I've know people that have safe-chat that are over the age of 13


[03-May-20 06:40 PM] Polk#1596
Idk if a valid reason would be "You have safechat on Roblox"


[03-May-20 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I wouldn't really think that's fair thats just my opinion


[03-May-20 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
I banned users that have admitted their age on the discord


[03-May-20 06:41 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah, so I woud only ban people that go "I'm 3!!" even if it is a joke or not


[03-May-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
Yes thats what ive been doing


[03-May-20 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
so we dont ban people just because they have safe-chat


[03-May-20 06:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok word you can unban then


[03-May-20 06:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Or ask if they are under the age of 13 and if they say yes keep banned


[03-May-20 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
im waiting for her response


[03-May-20 06:43 PM] Polk#1596
I think we should avoid banning people for being under 13 unless they admit it. Like saying you are 5 on Twitter is something we should avoid looking at


[03-May-20 06:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It was reported to me by someone, obv not gonna start going around asking everyone w/ sfae chat if they are under 13 in the DC lol


[03-May-20 06:43 PM] Polk#1596
Oof


[03-May-20 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
I think only if they admit their age on the discord server is where it should count


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
^


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] stacey#1000
thats what ive been doing forever


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] Polk#1596
Yes


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
we cant pick every individual safechatter


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
lol


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] bman#0435
thats just excessive


[03-May-20 06:44 PM] Polk#1596
At least 30-40% are below 13 anyway. It's a kids game


[03-May-20 06:45 PM] Polk#1596
Just keep doing what you have been doing


[03-May-20 06:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
@¢. ღ for now no, we might add more things in the future that u can get paid for but for now no


[03-May-20 06:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
how much do u get paid for a co hosted session


[03-May-20 06:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
Same as session


[03-May-20 06:46 PM] a. ღ#4222
then why is it a different like category


[03-May-20 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hosting and cohosting is 85 robux per one


[03-May-20 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Because I need to know which one u did


[03-May-20 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Polk still does training board so I can see how many u hosted


[03-May-20 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
And hopefully it will match with ur checklist


[03-May-20 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u cohost then u won't have a card on the board

I will legit yell at their HRs, but the devs are like


[03-May-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
SR rank


[03-May-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
so idk what they can even do about it


[03-May-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
Idk if they can do anything


[03-May-20 08:03 PM] emma;#1525
The devs are above CEO and president


[03-May-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
But we can


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
literally only below silver


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
We can ban them from the hotel


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yikes this ain't a good sign


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can talk to Silver.


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming is he actually going to care


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
like not meaning offense to him


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no that doesn't really solve anything @stacey


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
but he's the owner so idk if he'll care that much about what his devs are doing


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey ok but if we normallyl ban for glitching


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
then we should ban them too lmao


[03-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
they dont get special treatment for being sb devs


[03-May-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
It would solve the problem of them coming back and doing it again... @xAfroTrey


[03-May-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
i mean i say ban them


[03-May-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
we'll see what silver says

[03-May-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
ultimately i dont think they can do anything


[03-May-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
like if builder boy glitched at their restaurant, we can't do anything about that lol


[03-May-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525

[03-May-20 08:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[03-May-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525

[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525

[03-May-20 08:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah but like why


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
There is a vid too


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Idk


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal they've hired multiple people who hacked, glitched, and terrorized our hotel as MRs there


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well if majority hrs vote that then 🤷🏻‍♂️


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
who


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
and now their devs are glitching at our games


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like Ramm said this isn’t our first issue with them


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
they dont hold their LRs accountable


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
which group


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
sizzle


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
sizzleburger


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
they sell ranks too


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
yes we've had a couple issues with them


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
so if their LRs troll at our hotel, they just say "we dont punish our LRs sorry they dont rep us"


[03-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
meanwhile they expect us to fire our LRs


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
they legit were the worst HRs ive ever worked with for a situation


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
honestly i dont care if we unally decide what u guys want to do


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
one of them RESIGNED and didnt tell me as we were actively discussing something big


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I would be chill with unallying


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal ok well its minn's  "job" and he's an HR there so even if all of us want to he prob wont let us


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
🤷‍♀️


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They don’t do shit with us


[03-May-20 08:08 PM] emma;#1525
yeah they really dont lol


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
except that one gamenight


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
and they violate a ton of our ally rules


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
such as SELLING RANKS


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but that's it


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
but anyways


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
koala did it too


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
thing is though


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
their devs should know better though like..


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
ok but koala hasnt treated us like crap


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
sizzle doesn’t daf


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
gaf*


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they both do lr ranks


[03-May-20 08:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
just thought i might put that out there


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
ok but does that change the fact that sizzleburger is literally a useless ally


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
what do we actually benefit from them


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
nothing


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
more members but we technically have enough atm


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
all they've done recently is hire CBs and then TELL THEM EXACTLY WHO REPORTED THEM SO THEY CAN HARASSS US


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
almost to 1 million too


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They give us more trouble than help us


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
tell us they dont hold LRs accountable and it sucks if they troll at our hotel


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
legit any time we have a real concern with SB


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
not host any events with us


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
and bring it up to them they dont do anything


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like tf makes them think the devs can just glitch our hotel


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
PFT trey we don’t need them for more members


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
and now their devs are glitching at our hotel


[03-May-20 08:10 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
their SECOND HIGHEST RANKING MEMBERS


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
sizzleburger only has like 350k


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
We probably get members that aren’t even from their group


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
their growth rate isnt even that good


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah that's why i said we technically have enough


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not really


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
koala has 430k


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
we really dont need them as an ally


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
and theyve been around for MUCH shorter of a time


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
also can we unally tsunami


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Imma hit up the owner


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Sizzle has been around since like 2015


[03-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525
while we're on the topic of useless allies


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
tsunami is a dead group


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
They are


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i haven't heard of them in a minute lol


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
is their discord even back up


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I forgot we were allies with them


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
or was that breezy's who was gone


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
also is breezy's worth keeping either


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who even reps tsunami sushi


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uhhh


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
legit the only allies that do anything at all are koala, boba, and glazin


[03-May-20 08:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll check


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
and then ofc baby and bears groups lol but those dont count


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
boba is probably the best out of the 5


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
boba has a lot of potential


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
idk i think we need to look into new allies


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
honestly once venti gets back up to like 25k i wouldnt mind looking at them


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
goddamn i wanted to mention venti so badly


[03-May-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they just went to 3k in less than a week


[03-May-20 08:14 PM] emma;#1525
but their growth rate needs to improve from pre-shutdown


[03-May-20 08:14 PM] emma;#1525
bc it took them 2 years to get 25k


[03-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mhm


[03-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
despite the member count, i really do like everything else about it


[03-May-20 08:19 PM] bman#0435
whatd i miss oop


[03-May-20 08:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
sizzle developers glitching in the hotel


[03-May-20 08:19 PM] stacey#1000
I want to unally with sb


[03-May-20 08:19 PM] bman#0435
bruh do they not respect us anymore lmfao


[03-May-20 08:19 PM] stacey#1000
and get new allies


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm just gonna see how silver deals w/ the issue lol


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but ya


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
i mean im not expecting him to fire his devs


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're going to be fucked if they don't take this seriously


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] emma;#1525
no and they shouldnt lol


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
like i would expect he would at least discuss it with them


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] emma;#1525
we wouldnt fire builderboy if he did that


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] emma;#1525
but we also would probably talk to him about it


[03-May-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435
probs gonna say his devs dont represent their group💀🤡


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] emma;#1525
so if silver doesnt talk to his devs about respecting their ally...


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] emma;#1525
🤷‍♀️


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We have to base it off of his response


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
builder boy isn't dumb lol


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] emma;#1525
@bman HONESTLY AT THIS POINT DOES ANYONE REPRESENT THEIR GROUP


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
then bye bye sb as an ally


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] emma;#1525
LMAO


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
LMAO


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like if he just brushes it off, then we gotta do something


[03-May-20 08:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
might as well turn it to one big document if we do end up unallying lol


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if we do unally


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this about to be bigger than ninja leaving twitch


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] emma;#1525
a document for what


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] emma;#1525
we arent gonna publicly humiliate them trey lol


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not saying that lol

[03-May-20 08:22 PM] bman#0435
well if we unally a long termed alliance we kinda need to explain why lmfao


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
What do I say


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I want to speak to him


[03-May-20 08:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
?


[03-May-20 08:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes


[03-May-20 08:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or address the issue to her


[03-May-20 08:23 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming Say you want to speak to him regarding an issue with his developers, and since they are ranked higher than presidents you need to discuss it with silver


[03-May-20 08:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Pick your poison


[03-May-20 08:23 PM] emma;#1525
and if they say no then just tell them i guess lol

@RAMMGaming noob you didnt vote on your own promotion opinion card


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
dont fire ppl for things we fire for


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if they ask us


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
about someone


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we look into it


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and then


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we ask them


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
to do it


[03-May-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and they dont


[03-May-20 08:32 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming slight caveat, if they fell through and landed on the chair, that's why they didnt fall through


[03-May-20 08:33 PM] emma;#1525
and you can see the second dev did fall through the floor after jumping off the chair


[03-May-20 08:33 PM] emma;#1525
so i dont *think* they exploited


[03-May-20 08:33 PM] emma;#1525
but its hard to tell

[03-May-20 08:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
He got up and then walked through the bathroom wall


[03-May-20 08:33 PM] emma;#1525
no, the chairs catch you because they have seats attached


[03-May-20 08:33 PM] emma;#1525

[04-May-20 12:24 AM] stacey#1000

They apologized


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
we wouldn't fire builderboy if he glitched at an alliance


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] stacey#1000
No we didn’t want them fired


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] stacey#1000
We wanted them to at least speak to them


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
well


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
ask if they could at least speak to him


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
and like


[04-May-20 12:25 AM] xM_inn#2821

He’s a management


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
We shouldn’t have to tell them this shit


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
They should be good allies and do it by themselves.


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
And this isn’t the first incident


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
But did you ask them to


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] emma;#1525
he's a manager too?


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] emma;#1525
so he's also an MR


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] emma;#1525
and they're saying he doesn't represent the group lol


[04-May-20 12:26 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It says MR in training


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
doesnt represent the group my ass


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
okay


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
mr


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
it says MR in training


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
MR in training isnt even a thing anymore


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
its Management Intern


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
so is he a management intern then


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
did he just happen to have an older role


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
o


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
why does he have that role


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
no


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
development


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
did they like


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
server management


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
to do like


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
discord bots


[04-May-20 12:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
forget to remove the role


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
idk but trust me hes not management


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
um ok but they should definitely consider changing names lol


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
hes never at a session


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
EVER


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i would like an apology from them personally tbh lol


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming did they even offer to talk to their devs


[04-May-20 12:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but we know that ain't going to happen


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Nope


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Brushed it off


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
Like I’d expect baby and bear to talk to builder boy if he did that


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
That’s the only thing they said


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
even though he’s “not affiliated”


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
You should ask if they’re going to


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
That’s the only message I got


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
The devs are banned right


[04-May-20 12:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
ask if they'll speak to him or have him apologize personally


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The thing is


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
maybe my opinion is slightly different since i work at SB and stuff, but they seem apologetic about it


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
like


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think they should've been told to apologize


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
^


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're a 300K member group w/ loads of situations they've handled


[04-May-20 12:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They need to act like one


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
their devs should of has common sense coming to do that at the hotel


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
I just never get the feeling SB actually cares


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
same


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
they knew we were allied


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
why do it at bloxton..


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
Like them refusing to fire LRs who troll at our hotel Bc “they don’t represent the group”


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like it doesnt make sense


[04-May-20 12:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Their investigation team needs a reform ngl


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause their current one is kind of failing


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
well


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
ik we shouldn't have to ask


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
but


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
ask and see what yaz says


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
im intrigued


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
they never take things seriously and make up excuses like they dont represent the group but they do


[04-May-20 12:32 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Agreed


[04-May-20 12:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok ok so here’s the thing


[04-May-20 12:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Min has a point, they aren’t a high rank


[04-May-20 12:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It’s like builder bot


[04-May-20 12:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
boy*


[04-May-20 12:33 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He doesn’t really represent us in any way shape or form


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
The only concern I have is that it says he’s a management/MR in training


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Can they just fix the role names


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He shouldn’t need those rules


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Idk why a name this misleading is still here


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He is a dev, it’s the 3rd highest rank


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
He isnt an MR in training thoughhhhhh


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
MR in training isnt a thing anymore


[04-May-20 12:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
Its Management Intern


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
So his roles obviously havent been updated in a while


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
So is that an LR position?


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
I mean, they dont represent directly but in a way they still do


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
like if builder_boy did this at an ally


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
we would at least speak to him


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
I would expect they at least warn him about it or get him to apologize


[04-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
but they cant even do that


[04-May-20 12:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
Well


[04-May-20 12:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
Management Intern is still an LR position yes


[04-May-20 12:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
However he isnt a Management Intern


[04-May-20 12:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
He isnt management at all


[04-May-20 12:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
How do we know we havent spoke to him tho?


[04-May-20 12:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
ok yaz just messaged me


[04-May-20 12:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
interestinggggg


[04-May-20 12:38 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what he say


[04-May-20 12:38 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
And what is he saying?


[04-May-20 12:38 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He’s talking to me, interesting he needs to contact you as well


[04-May-20 12:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
They aren’t discussing with him AT ALL


[04-May-20 12:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

minimal shud be talked to


[04-May-20 12:40 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and he should apologize at the very least


[04-May-20 12:40 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
They aren’t gonna


[04-May-20 12:41 AM] stacey#1000
like they should at least say its not cool and that there was a concern over it

So we aren’t gonna take any more steps, but I am pretty disappointed with sizzle


[04-May-20 12:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Doesn’t look good for them at all


[04-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
vabajaa is a "contributor"


[04-May-20 12:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Hm


[04-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
so prob gives them a ton of money is what i'd assume


[04-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn what does contributor mean


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming if im being honest i wanted to unally even before this and so did a lot of us


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Can you screenshot


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
this is like


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
the 3rd time


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
tempted to put up a vote just to see what people say


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
there has been an issue with sizzle


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
i vote bye bye sizzle


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
Yeah and they've never done a single thing about any of our issues either


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I would vote too


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
3 strikes and you're out


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
what im most mad about is the harriet thing


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
They don’t even hold events


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
hire her, whatever


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
DONT TELL HER THAT I REPORTED HER


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
SO SHE CAN COME INTO MY DMS


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
AND CONFRONT ME


[04-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
🙄


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
like seriously that's HR 101


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
don't give people your sources


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
but whatever


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
..


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
Sb literally hosts events every weekend


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
but ok


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
not with us thoooo


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
they did two weeks ago


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"we can't confront our development team"


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm sorry but this ain't it


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn did they ever announce our may madness thing


[04-May-20 12:45 AM] stacey#1000
the events is fine


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
bc they announce boba and panda A LOT


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
but i dont see anything for our events


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the fact that this is not the first instance but the second is just not cool at all


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
third*


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] stacey#1000
but when it comes to real concerns we have they never do anything and thats major


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] stacey#1000
compared to events


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
third??


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
idk


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
yeah


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
1) harriet


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what was the other one


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
i dont think any of our allies did


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
2) an LR that they didnt fire bc "lrs dont rep them"


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
ill have to ask them to in alliance discussion oop


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
even tho the LR trolled MAJORLY


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
at the hotel


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
3) this


[04-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
and those are just the more major ones lol


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn yeah they haven't announced ANY of our events (excluding the joint one) since our awards


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
almost 2 months ago lol


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
we literally have hardly any allies tho, do we really need to get rid of them


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
literally half our allies are inactive anyways


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
breezys?? tsunami??


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] stacey#1000
we can get new ones


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
i say get rid of them


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
tsunami is dead anyways


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] emma;#1525
and ive legit never seen anything related to breezys ever


[04-May-20 12:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
so if we get rid of breezys and tsunami and then sizzle


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
jesus we're not gonna have any left


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
i mean


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
we have boba and koala


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
when it comes to allies


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
which are both solid


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
we have baby and bear's two groups


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
and CCC


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
we can find ones we like and see if they are interested in an alliance


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
and then maybe WE can send out alliance requests to groups we choose


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
instead of waiting for groups to come to us


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
STACEY YOU GENIUS took the words outta my mouth


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Lmao


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
like by waiting for big groups to come to us we only get the problematic ones lol


[04-May-20 12:48 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Listen I don’t care if we keep them or don’t, they both have their consequences


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
We don’t want beef between us for this bs


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
They are on THIN ice though


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
THIN ice


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] emma;#1525
i dont see the point in having allies that dont announce our things, dont support us, dont reprimand their workers for trolling at our hotels, leaving in the middle of investigations and not alerting us, hiring CBs we report, exposing our names TO those CBs...


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're pretty fucked


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
If someone else happens within the next 3 months, get rid of them


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] stacey#1000
I would like to ally with AMH whenever they get 25k members which will be awhile


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
@emma; we don’t announce things in our ally chat


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] emma;#1525
if we keep sizzle now they're on thin thin thin ice


[04-May-20 12:49 AM] stacey#1000
is it 10k members or 25k


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming that's not my job


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] emma;#1525
i announce my allied rep stuff for glazin


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Oh fuck we did


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] emma;#1525
im not a SB rep lol


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
We did announce it


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
in ally chat


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] emma;#1525
hm interesting


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I want Venti so badly but


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
ok i agree with if something else happens get rid of them


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They need their group member count up first


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes this would be silly


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
To unally for


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
but would’ve liked a better response.


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
sorry its hard to type while im on shift cause theres lots happening rn


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think this is silly


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
for sure


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
give me a few minutes and ill talk properly


[04-May-20 12:50 AM] emma;#1525
i still think we coulda unallied months ago but sure we'll wait for the straw that breaks the camels back ig


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
cause i wanna share my opinion


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
You’re good Min


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
no harm in keeping a group that does nothing with us anyways


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
besides one event every few months to keep up appearances lol


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It just seems as though they brush a lot of things off


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't like how soft SB is becoming


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
I just don't think they have a well trained HR team tbh


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like imagine a forest fire


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
Like i get it's super hard


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
and idk exactly what they do


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like they are using the get out of it easy card on this situation


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They'll be the type of people to say


[04-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
so i dont want to say they all suck


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
but they leave a lot to be hoped for


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Oh, it's fine, the fire will just burn itself out."


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
as far as HR stuff goes


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
i mean not holding your LRs accountable because you say they don't rep your group??


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
when they make up 95% of your group?


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
okay...


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] stacey#1000
we fire our LRs if they troll at allies so...???


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
I mean would they hire an LR who'd trolled at us a TON because they don't count it?


[04-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
as an MR*


[04-May-20 12:53 AM] stacey#1000
wow


[04-May-20 12:53 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
didn’t they come to us one time for a situation few months ago?


[04-May-20 12:54 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I could of sworn there was something where they had to DM us regarding our group


[04-May-20 12:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes lol


[04-May-20 12:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I hate to say it but it looks like this guy is pretty close to the staff


[04-May-20 12:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Looking through his chat history, he has been there since 2018


[04-May-20 12:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Interesting


[04-May-20 12:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Seems to think he is above everyone and can do what he wants


[04-May-20 12:55 AM] emma;#1525
popeye?


[04-May-20 12:56 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes


[04-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
so he doesn't rep the group but is in charge of many aspects of group management

[04-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
is close with most of the group members


[04-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
Tbh if they're not gonna talk to him, I will lmao


[04-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
I have no problems DMing him and letting him know why he was banned


[04-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
And if sizzle has a problem with it then I guess the score is 10000-1

[04-May-20 12:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
lol


[04-May-20 12:57 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He’s around frequently, several pictures of him with other staff as well


[04-May-20 12:58 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok not severe, but a few


[04-May-20 12:58 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It’s not like builder boy where you never ever see him


[04-May-20 12:59 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
See like


[04-May-20 12:59 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Builder Boy is smarter than that lol


[04-May-20 12:59 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I’m not happy at all with this, but we will keep it on the back burner for a future incident, which I know will arise soon


[04-May-20 01:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
AKA


[04-May-20 01:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The last straw lol


[04-May-20 01:00 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yup


[04-May-20 01:00 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
If something tops this, I won’t be surprised


[04-May-20 01:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Me either


[04-May-20 01:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wouldn't be surprised if Baby and Bear unfriended them lol


[04-May-20 01:03 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bear is already chill with it


[04-May-20 01:17 AM] emma;#1525
owners pay HRs to care lol which is fair


[04-May-20 01:18 AM] emma;#1525
if i owned a huge group i wouldnt want to deal with the drama either


[04-May-20 01:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Which owner @emma;


[04-May-20 01:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not sure if you're talking Silver or us


[04-May-20 01:19 AM] emma;#1525
any large group


[04-May-20 01:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[04-May-20 03:47 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey he was a senior back in 2017, his account got terminated 3 times so eventually they stopped giving him his rank back


[04-May-20 03:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
How is that making it worse lol

:bloxton3: **BLOXTON HOTELS | MAY MADNESS | ART CONTEST: RESULTS** 🎨 

Greetings Bloxton Hotels,

It is 7:00 PM BST, which means it is time to reveal the 3 winners of the Bloxton Hotels Art Contest! We had over 70 creative art submissions from our wonderful community members so this decision was really hard, however after a long discussion, our High-Rank Team has decided on 3 winning art pieces. If you didn't win, please don't be discouraged as we loved every single submission and it's just a shame we're only able to choose 3 winners! Without further ado, I present you with the 3 winning Bloxton art pieces, congratulations to the following people..

Once again, if you didn't win, please don't be discouraged and thank you so much to those who participated.

[04-May-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
@bman you’d have to make 600 sales at 5 robux each to even match that, and that’s with no tax


[04-May-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
That’s in one month


[04-May-20 03:42 PM] emma;#1525
Are they making a separate home store or are they adding it onto their cafe


[04-May-20 03:42 PM] bman#0435

Wow so that’s 1000 sales in a month


[04-May-20 03:43 PM] emma;#1525
To even get your money back


[04-May-20 03:43 PM] emma;#1525
Probably more with tax


[04-May-20 03:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
thats a lot


[04-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
There needs to be some sort of guarantee that if you don’t make your money back you don’t pay the full rental amount


[04-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
Or I wouldn’t


[04-May-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435

[04-May-20 03:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[04-May-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
ur fine


[04-May-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
@bman yeah it's worth asking about, I'd also be interested in what the average sales are for their homestore per designer because if they historically dont even get 1000 sales per designer per month then its a lost cause to begin with


[04-May-20 04:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

@Polk If we can make it part of the 20 events we already have planned for may... then maybe


[04-May-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
but we legit have too many things going on to just plan ANOTHER event


[04-May-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
poor minn's head will fall off


[04-May-20 05:01 PM] Polk#1596
Lol well


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] Polk#1596
Idk how a gamenight would be something like a egg hunt


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it doesnt seem


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
possible


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] Polk#1596
His suggestion just sounds like an ordinary event to me


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
without devs


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it's creative but


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we dont have btools at the hotel so it wouldnt rly work


[04-May-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Baby and bear got their own stuff to do


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If I recall correctly


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bear is working on a project


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
I know.. we don't have devs, and the things we can do at the hotel is very limited


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
Yup


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Plus may madness and normal sessions are in the way


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
It would be tough


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not bad but


[04-May-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not my cup of tea either


[04-May-20 05:10 PM] bman#0435
what would our quest be lmfao


[04-May-20 05:10 PM] bman#0435
book a room?


[04-May-20 05:10 PM] bman#0435
its giving more focus to the quest and not the actual hotel


[04-May-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk it doesnt sound like it would be a developmental thing


[04-May-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
but we'd need baby and bear to give us btools at the hotel to do any sort of activity there


[04-May-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
Well technically us building would be developing noob


[04-May-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
But


[04-May-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
If you manage to get that


[04-May-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
Then I'm all for it


[04-May-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
I don't know why we don't have btools in the first place


[04-May-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
no its not developing if we're building on a server lol


[04-May-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
that's just f3x


[04-May-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525

[04-May-20 06:57 PM] emma;#1525
actually not a question


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
What's ur question


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
we need to clarify the whole "breaks vs no breaks" thing at the hotel


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
What's ur actually not a question


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
bc i coulda sworn staff were allowed to take breaks IF all the stations had workers


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Breaks pls


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
but people have been telling LRs no breaks are allowed


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
soooo


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
i am confusion


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Which is dumb


[04-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
wow we AGREE

[04-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Petition to make an announcement about stop putting  the wrong avatars into gfx as it just spoils the vibe :(


[04-May-20 07:00 PM] bman#0435
or abt not leaving people out 😭


[04-May-20 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Only leave people out if they don't rlly care and have Stapleton avatars on (me)


[04-May-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
or how about quit stapleton because it sucks


[04-May-20 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
I respect your opinion


[04-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Actually no i don't! Ur opinion is wrong


[04-May-20 07:03 PM] bman#0435
@emma; how abt no breaks and have the staff server hop if the stations r full lol


[04-May-20 07:03 PM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 just like ur avatar on every piece of fan art :)


[04-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Which is better:

Stapleton

Having the correct avatar on ur fanart which 99% of then u don't care about


[04-May-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
The 1% being my pfp


[04-May-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Pretty hot


[04-May-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
One of the 40% that got the correct avatar!


[04-May-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435
correct avatar > stapleton


[04-May-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435

[04-May-20 07:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Stapleton is a religion @bman


[04-May-20 07:06 PM] bman#0435
a religion that shouldnt be preached


[04-May-20 07:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Why don't u like Stapleton!


[04-May-20 07:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma likes Stapleton like a tiny tiny bit


[04-May-20 07:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Do u like it a tiny tiny bit


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
@bman


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 dont wear your stapleton uniform all the time if you dont want people using it in GFX


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
theres a THOUGHT


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
tiny ain't enough fam lol


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] bman#0435
it got so boring tbh


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
@bman also how about we dont treat 13 year olds like slaves and let them go to the spa for 5 minutes if they want a break


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] bman#0435
and repetitive


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but what if the server isn't full of members


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] bman#0435
@emma; what do u want, the air to massage their brainwaves or sum


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
these rat raids are annoying af


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
Yes bman


[04-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
I do


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's where the problem can happen


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] emma;#1525
I also think it's weird that we're like the only group that doesnt let staff take breaks


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no others do it too lol


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] emma;#1525
we're talking 5 minutes as long as their station has one other person


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] emma;#1525
i dont know why y'all are against breaks


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so like


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] bman#0435
koala doesnt


[04-May-20 07:09 PM] emma;#1525
they'll just go fake afk if they need a break anyways so we're not preventing anything


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
we just come off as strict which y'all complain about sometimes


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435
sb and boba dont have "breaks" but they let u order


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
ok so that's basically a break lol


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435
like a 3 second break if anything lol


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we do that too


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435
if they need a break then they can leave the hotel


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not really a break but yeah


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
so our staff aren't allowed to enjoy the hotel they work at


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
basically


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435
having breaks will fill the servers up with more stafff and leave others empty


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
not really lol


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
it wont have that big of a difference


[04-May-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435
they can, in a private server


[04-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
i mean we wouldn't know i guess because no one's ever cared about our staff enough to try


[04-May-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435
at least our staff represent our group


[04-May-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435
.


[04-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
idk why we cant trial run it and if it works great if it really doesnt work we can always reverse it

[04-May-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435

@emma; its super hard to remember to change ur avatar


[04-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
at least we have that going for us 😂


[04-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 its also super annoying to not use an avatar that someone currently has for a GFX


[04-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
you have to construct it piece by piece


[04-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
instead of just importing it


[04-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
so dont be LAZY and change ur AVATAR


[04-May-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it takes like 5 clicks bonnie lol


[04-May-20 07:12 PM] bonnie591#0591

[04-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525

[04-May-20 07:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Mental disability had nothing to do with that conversation


[04-May-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
that's what retard means


[04-May-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
its a derogatory term for someone with a mental disability


[04-May-20 07:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Does it..?


[04-May-20 07:19 PM] emma;#1525
it doesnt mean "you're an idiot" it means "you are mentally disabled and that makes you dumb"


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thought it was the rude word for idiot/stupid


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
i learned this in like 5th grade how do you not know this


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
no


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
mentally retarted used to be the accepted word for mentally handicapped


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
but people started using retarted in a derogatory way


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
so now the "correct" term is handicapped


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] emma;#1525
and retard is a slur


[04-May-20 07:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

holly was already doxxed, thats the people that doxxed her im sure. but honestly, it was hollys fault for being dumb enough to make her ROBLOX and TikTok the same username and then to use the audio thats like "my name, my age, my favorite color, my height, my sign, do i have a lover, whats my nationality, here are some things that inspire me"

don't hmu 😔 @stacey @bman


[05-May-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
I told her it was denied because more time was needed and appealing a blacklist is not easy


[05-May-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
I doubt she will ever actually get appealed


[05-May-20 04:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh stacey

this is what I told her


[05-May-20 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
I'll be honest. With the actions that you did in the past, this will be hard to appeal as you did CB on multiple accounts which is a major concern. It may not be impossible to appeal, but it's not something that will happen any time soon. It will take a lot more time to appeal, as a lot more time is needed.


[05-May-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
hopefully that gets the point across


[05-May-20 04:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's going to play the victim

[05-May-20 06:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
I have a fun idea for an event.

During this coronavirus pandemic most people are at home what if we made "riddles" or clues scavenged around either discord, the hotel, group page, etc. and leave "Codes". These codes can be DMed to me and the winner will receive either bloxton bucks, a unique vehicle at Bloxton that only they can use, and a few other goodies.

We could call the event "Bloxton Hotel Hunt"
Furthermore, this will bolster our popularity, provide something fun to do to win unique limited items! I only see positives. What do you think?
@High Rank


[05-May-20 06:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
i love scavenger hunts/riddles and this would be super fun to do as well


[05-May-20 06:23 PM] Beartikal#9760

fattoratto


[05-May-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
If you are willing to develop for it now it would be a great way to do this event with an alliance as well


[05-May-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
Just tell Polk that. He said he wasn’t sure if anyone would develop for it


[05-May-20 06:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
anyway i got this idea after seeing Wendy's twitter - they are doing somethimg similar but for Wendys coupons. they posted 1 hour ago and my god was i close to winning free 100 bucks at wendys


[05-May-20 06:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
i lost tho so rip my spicy nuggets


[05-May-20 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
Rip


[05-May-20 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk when you’re alive did Koala say anything else


[05-May-20 06:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
their idea sounds a little similar but not exactly what i was thinking


[05-May-20 06:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
depends how u guys wanna approach it


[05-May-20 06:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
join up or just us


[05-May-20 06:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
idk


[05-May-20 06:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
still not 100% but ill ask baby about it


[05-May-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
They wanted an egg hunt which is similar to the scavenger hunt I guess


[05-May-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
In a way


[05-May-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Just wasn’t sure about their idea because it requires development


[05-May-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
But it you are willing to do it, it’s a fun event with an alliance


[05-May-20 06:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I like the scavenger idea, people are looking for something to do and free Bloxton Bucks is an easy prize


[05-May-20 06:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
also


[05-May-20 06:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
to further make people want to participate


[05-May-20 06:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
we're also offering a limited item that only they can get for this event


[05-May-20 06:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
perhaps a limited boombox, a limited vehicle, etc


[05-May-20 06:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
"limited" as in unique, exclusive, nobody else can have it


[05-May-20 06:49 PM] bman#0435
how abt like a penthouse without paying or sum


[05-May-20 06:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
possible but things like that could be bought having an exclusive item probably means more to the user


[05-May-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That dope I’m sure a lot of people would love it


[05-May-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@bman @Cam hey uh could you vote on the recent appeal i put up on #hr-announcements

omg a customized baby and bear boom box @Beartikal


[05-May-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
as a test what do you think this means


[05-May-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
```
The vice chairman is always at the hotel.
Sometimes he rests, but when it rains,
He gets soaked, what a pain, but if you
Give him shelter all will be well.
```


[05-May-20 07:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
uhmm


[05-May-20 07:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmm


[05-May-20 07:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
is it the secret area cave lol


[05-May-20 07:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
no


[05-May-20 07:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
damn it


[05-May-20 07:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uhhh


[05-May-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-May-20 07:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the spa @Beartikal


[05-May-20 07:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
```
The vice chairman is always at the hotel.
```
how can i be there when im not there tho


[05-May-20 07:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
```but when it rains,
He gets soaked```


[05-May-20 07:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
adn i thought this was an easy one oop-


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no its not if those two ain't that answers lol


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok the answer


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
is the bear on the rooftop


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
in the lounge chair


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
```
but when it rains,
He gets soaked
```


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] bman#0435
but that aint shelter


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
exactly


[05-May-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
it says to


[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
```Give him shelter```


[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
its called equipping an umbrella when it rains next to the bear


[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
i guess that was a hard one


[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760

[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[05-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760

[05-May-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-May-20 08:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-May-20 08:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[05-May-20 08:19 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

imma be busyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy


[05-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yo uh @bman


[05-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this should be a suspension https://trello.com/c/urn2925S/193099-craftyk2013-6-refusing-to-wear-the-uniform-unprofessionalism-and-minor-lack-of-grammar


[05-May-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
how so


[05-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
aight so


[05-May-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
it doesnt actually show him refusing to wear his uniform, and he said 2 things


[05-May-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"uniform my cheeks"


[05-May-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uhhh


[05-May-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i would kind of suspend for that ngl


[05-May-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
i wouldnt rly consider that for a suspension


[05-May-20 08:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you can see him trying to get away too lol


[05-May-20 08:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so basically this is what is being dealt with:


[05-May-20 08:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
a) no uniform (kind of obvious)


[05-May-20 08:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
b) pretty sure he said uniform my cheeks in response to the user


[05-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
c) you can see him equipping the segway as soon as he said that


[05-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if we blend that together, that's like x3 violations lol


[05-May-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
if u look in chat theres no statement from the reporter about wearing the uniform


[05-May-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
and hes allowed to use the segway freely


[05-May-20 08:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
true but like


[05-May-20 08:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
is "uniform my cheeks" appropriate


[05-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
if someone isnt in uniform they shouldn't be using the segway


[05-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah and i doubt the using is patrolling either


[05-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
also considering "uniform my cheeks" is *most likely* a substitute for "uniform my ass"


[05-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
i mean


[05-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
🤷‍♀️


[05-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah exactly lol


[05-May-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
if u want to suspend then go ahead but i dont personally think its suspension worthy


[05-May-20 08:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
sounds good to me lol


[05-May-20 08:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also holy shit


[05-May-20 09:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@RAMMGaming that’s what I was thinking bahahahaha


[06-May-20 01:11 AM] Beartikal#9760
hey guys


[06-May-20 01:11 AM] Beartikal#9760
at some point did we every change the trello board for the training schedule


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] Beartikal#9760
this is why the in-game session list api doesnt work


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] Cam#5887
ye we changed it once


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] Cam#5887
but


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] Cam#5887
i thought we reached the max cards


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] Cam#5887
so it stoppoed working


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] Cam#5887
stopped*


[06-May-20 01:12 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
we did


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
trello took us down


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] Cam#5887
yes rip


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
yeah thats why it stopped


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
it was moved


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] Cam#5887
ay bear, ever thought about adding a board in the actual hotel?


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey omg i remember that xd


[06-May-20 01:13 AM] Cam#5887

[06-May-20 01:14 AM] Cam#5887
that would be mr. polk


[06-May-20 01:14 AM] Cam#5887
he said it didnt look like a board with almost 1 million members, so he changed it


[06-May-20 01:14 AM] Beartikal#9760
my god what a living legend


[06-May-20 01:14 AM] Cam#5887
it looks awesome


[06-May-20 01:16 AM] Beartikal#9760
alright its fixed you can now ask bear at the front desk for info on interviews, trainings up next.


[06-May-20 01:17 AM] Cam#5887
oooooooooooooooooooo


[06-May-20 01:17 AM] Cam#5887
wooo


[06-May-20 01:17 AM] Beartikal#9760
also it works on your local time


[06-May-20 01:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
hey uh can we do something about loud audios lol


[06-May-20 01:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause like


[06-May-20 01:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
currently i only enforce Bypassed audios, i neard a racial sluir audio and he was p-banned for it


[06-May-20 01:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
aight but it can be a little distracting


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know there's a mute option but likee


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] Beartikal#9760
correct but i added a mute boomboxes and thought that would be enough


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
no it's not lol


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] Beartikal#9760
then how would i manage these loud audios


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i would just ban because:


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] Beartikal#9760
they are bypassed after all they should never get to be that loud


[06-May-20 01:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) they usually get taken down by roblox itself


[06-May-20 01:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) i'm not really sure younger people click the settings anyways


[06-May-20 01:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's basically it for me


[06-May-20 01:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
also let's think of a scenario though


[06-May-20 01:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what if like multiple join with the boombox and you hear 5 loud audios at the same time


[06-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
you can kick and warn for now for those super loud audios not comfortable with banning considering they purchased the gamepass and considering sometimes they think it's okay, theres nowhere that says it **isnt allowed**


[06-May-20 01:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok


[06-May-20 01:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but what if they continue


[06-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
ill add a Warning on the boombox user interface but until then warn


[06-May-20 01:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
do we ban them for not complying


[06-May-20 01:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
this Warning will serve as a "Hey you will be banned if you abuse the system":


[06-May-20 01:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
sure if they dont comply


[06-May-20 01:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
is that going to be in the next update


[06-May-20 01:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
yeah we'll add it


[06-May-20 01:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
tomorrow probs


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait is the new update coming tomorrow


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
or just later lol


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know you guys mentioned housekeeping in the conversation too


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
tomorrow for updating warning on boomboxes, and a little somethign extra


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
the bigger updates later


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
housekeeping later


[06-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760

a HACKER BRIBED an ADMIN to HACK ROBLOX
This is the most unbelievable things I've seen in my nearly 8 years of playing Roblox.

[06-May-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no not that i know of @Bloo_Berriez


[06-May-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but even without warnings, this shouldn't really haven't escalated the way it was here


[06-May-20 03:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
true but honestly she didn’t really break any rules, she just went over board with how she took a handle of things.. so idk I’m kinda in middle.


[06-May-20 03:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like she needs to understand she’s probably talking to children lol


[06-May-20 03:58 PM] bman#0435
tbh it seemed like she was being pretty rude but then noticed it and tried playing it off as a joke


[06-May-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i have to disagree bloo


[06-May-20 03:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk y’all voted in suspension.. I personally not for it since she didn’t break any rules.. but I’ll agree she did go over board with how she reacted like this AINT boot camp


[06-May-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think there's some rules she's broken honestly such as:


[06-May-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) not being calm and composed given her situation


[06-May-20 04:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) failing to do some duties such as passing trainees due to her being distracted


[06-May-20 04:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3) not being an example to the lrs, she basically humiliated them and often acted too strict


[06-May-20 04:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Like I said, you guys can suspend since you already got yourself the votes but I’ve been to many groups before where I’ve seen people get yelled at by the higher ranks, which I dislike cause this is Roblox not some Amazon company, but I don’t seen a reason for a suspension when we could really just warn her for it.


[06-May-20 04:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
nah i see what you mean


[06-May-20 04:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but damn


[06-May-20 04:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
4 people reported her


[06-May-20 04:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
now that's what i call a yikes


[06-May-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Kinda reminds me of KJ lmao


[06-May-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he literally scared me as an Lr


[06-May-20 04:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
did he do something similar to this


[06-May-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Literally probably worst


[06-May-20 04:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
He would scream at everyone at trainings to line up in a single line, talk and you’re kicked


[06-May-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
how did you guys not fire him-


[06-May-20 04:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk I was an LR at time


[06-May-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if he did this now


[06-May-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
his ass would be toast


[06-May-20 04:09 PM] a. ღ#4222

it kind of is


[06-May-20 04:10 PM] a. ღ#4222
Like ya she said some stuff that u wouldn’t normally say but


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk man


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
She didn’t say


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think she caused a scene


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
that much


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder rank 1s can still join your training centre


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
I would vote no but I am friends with her so that is biased


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Rank 1s joining the training server is actually a good thing


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
damn 7 votes now


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
I’m not even friends with her


[06-May-20 04:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Seniors can kick them instead of staff


[06-May-20 04:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
and sometimes she makes me mad


[06-May-20 04:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
But I honestly think a written wwarnint


[06-May-20 04:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
Is better

like


[06-May-20 04:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
Like ya ok she might have said some things that like were unnecessary but some hrs say “Don’t you know how to follow instructions ?”

she basically humiliated 5 helpers in front of her and kind of snapped


[06-May-20 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok


[06-May-20 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
That's called being strict


[06-May-20 04:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I see it as LRs were shocked because yeah that’s not how most HRs and Mrs act


[06-May-20 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Which isn't a good thing


[06-May-20 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
So boom written warning


[06-May-20 04:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But she didn’t do anything wrong, she just went over board


[06-May-20 04:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
and have u even asked her


[06-May-20 04:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And if we’re able to tell her that by issuing a written warning to fix her mistake and not go off then


[06-May-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the thing is bloo


[06-May-20 04:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
I feel like a written warning would be fine because she’d learn from that too


[06-May-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she had behavior like this in the past before bloxton existed


[06-May-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bman can back me up on this one


[06-May-20 04:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
if she had behavior issues in the past then why promote her again😂😂


[06-May-20 04:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But has she ever been warned, you said that she hasn’t had any issues here so out of Bloxton we can’t really do anything about it if it doesn’t relate


[06-May-20 04:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
If this was someone else like fraux would u still suspend


[06-May-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i would


[06-May-20 04:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Lmao


[06-May-20 04:16 PM] a. ღ#4222
PERSONALLY I just think suspension is a bit harsh


[06-May-20 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
didnt we suspend an mr like this before


[06-May-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
fraux might be my friend and all, but i know damn well he ain't acting like that


[06-May-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yes


[06-May-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i believe she was


[06-May-20 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
for like being too strict at trainings


[06-May-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 04:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
Personally looking at the screenshots there is nothing wrong with the first 3


[06-May-20 04:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 04:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
I promoted clar to head in 2017


[06-May-20 04:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Good ol days


[06-May-20 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
Legit other MRs have been suspended instead of warned for this because we've told them many times about behaviour at sessions


[06-May-20 04:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
The her telling them to march is a bit excessive so that’s prob what I’d warn for


[06-May-20 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
so why just warn her? its the same thing we've suspended others for


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well the vote is a suspension sooo


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
it should be common sense to treat LRs with respect


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well we should of warned the others


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my time to write the letter


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] a. ღ#4222
I mean hey we all have opinions and personally I think a warning is fine , but it’s not all about me it’s majority vote


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im almost done with it too


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
wait how long is the suspension


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wanna settle with 3 or 4

Bye bye question 7 and question 4


[06-May-20 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
I also say get rid of question 1 and change it to 1)How did you find Bloxton Hotels? or How did you discover our group? (since Bloxton tags)


[06-May-20 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
I need ideas


[06-May-20 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
what do yall want


[06-May-20 04:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
uhhhhhhhhh


[06-May-20 04:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ima just put the ones we use rn here to make it easier

1) What position are you seeking? (Only rank 4-7)
2) Why are you seeking this position? (3 sentences)
3) Have you had any past experience in a job like this? What groups?
*4) In a scale 1-10 (I-IO), how active are you? : Thirty seconds.*
5) Why should we hire you over others? (3 sentences)
6) Are you willing to put the time and effort into this position/job?
*7) In a scale of I-IO how well is your grammar and punctuation?*


[06-May-20 04:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think Q1 and Q2 should be mixed into the same question @stacey


[06-May-20 04:47 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 04:47 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 05:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
2.) Why do you think the HR team thought it was ever a good idea to promote one of our shift managers, xAfroTrey? (1 paragraph)


[06-May-20 05:09 PM] Beartikal#9760

[06-May-20 05:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
also i found out why staff areas break occasionally


[06-May-20 05:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
1) Exploiters abusing a vulnerability
2) Sometimes it happens randomly


[06-May-20 05:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill fix that tonight


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
with this, this will only have 1 exploit left


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1 exploit for all games??


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
bloxton*


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
the kill exploit that somehow works with the briefcase


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
or


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
basically


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
they weld on to the other player


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
and teleport off the map


[06-May-20 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760

[06-May-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
yea


[06-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
the Fly exploits and speed exploits are useless trying to fix


[06-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
so i dont fix those


[06-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
i fix the ones that harm staff


[06-May-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
or affect gameplay


[06-May-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 06:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

QIII) What are some goals you have planned for the group?
QIV) What are some of your strengths? (Provide 3+ sentences.


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think we should do strengths and weaknesses stacey


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] katie#0200
I think the younger applicants would understand the second one better if it was just “why do you want to work for Bloxton hotels”


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think Q3 should be re-worded it kinda seems like something u would ask a dev or ally to me idk tho


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; explain why you don’t want weaknesses in that question


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
or something like


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll reword it


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
:D


[06-May-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why are you interested in working for Bloxton Hotels?


[06-May-20 06:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bloxton tags for safechatters


[06-May-20 06:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk y tho


[06-May-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think in this group would be a great substitute


[06-May-20 06:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
can they see Blox-ton?


[06-May-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Still need a fifth question


[06-May-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
something about strengths being alone feels missing


[06-May-20 06:16 PM] katie#0200
What qualities do you have that could benefit you while working here


[06-May-20 06:16 PM] katie#0200
Idk


[06-May-20 06:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
maybe skills/strengths instead of just strengths?


[06-May-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe we could keep the question “Why should we hire you over others?”


[06-May-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
Because it’s basically that


[06-May-20 06:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i have a good one


[06-May-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

I HAVE AN ORIGINAL QUESTION TO ADD


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
How good is your punctuation? Rate on a scale from 1-10.


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
L @RAMMGaming


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] bman#0435
@katie i said the qualities one too but then i thought it was similar to “why shoukd we hire u over others”


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
How active will you be? Rate on a scale from 1-10


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:out:


[06-May-20 06:20 PM] stacey#1000
We eliminated the scale of 1-10 questions


[06-May-20 06:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're pointless as hell


[06-May-20 06:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
How much do you want trey to be fired? Rate from 1-10


[06-May-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
1000


[06-May-20 06:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[06-May-20 06:21 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[06-May-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so are we keeping question 3


[06-May-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
QI) How did you discover Blox-ton Hotels?
QII) Why are you interested in working at Blox-ton Hotels? Provide 3+ sentences)

[06-May-20 06:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
***While at the supermarket, the man behind you falls and spills his groceries on the floor. What do you do?***


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey asking a bunch of children to name weaknesses they have is 1) Pointless because it doesn’t affect their chances of working anyways and 2) kinda mean lol


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
We’re about positivity here!!!


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
There you go trey that’s why we shouldn’t include weaknesses


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
If just saying strengths sounds too odd we can always say “what skills do you have that would help you work here”


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
Same thing different wording


[06-May-20 06:32 PM] bman#0435
1 weakeness is dat i am 6 years old


[06-May-20 06:33 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
What if we keep question 6 and make it question 5


[06-May-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435
use 3 words to describe your personality


[06-May-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that has potential


[06-May-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
a bit easy but it can help help us have interviewees come back

[06-May-20 06:49 PM] a. ღ#4222

[06-May-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll wait a couple hours for others to view the questions and decide on it.


[06-May-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
Q3 sounds a bit confusing because they can’t exactly plan anything for the group


[06-May-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
Maybe change it to “what goals do you wish to achieve while working here”


[06-May-20 07:05 PM] katie#0200
idk


[06-May-20 07:06 PM] bman#0435
well maybe a goal they plan to achieve is to become an mr or hr  or to try out every lr rank


[06-May-20 07:07 PM] bman#0435
it can be interpreted in many different ways


[06-May-20 07:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@everyone why does everyone keep saying "Blox-ton" hotels


[06-May-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435

I think Bear may have talked to you about it, he said to issue a formal warning to Sizzle because they refused to talk to their dev


[06-May-20 08:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

how one of her developers was glitching at the hotel


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
going through walls


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
oh no im sure theyll reply the same way


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
'we cant control what they do'


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
why dont we just ban them from bloxton?


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
nah theyll probs suck up to u because they dont want to unally with a nearly 1 mil group


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I mean its a valid point that they cant really do anything


[06-May-20 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
they went through the wall that might just be an exploit


[06-May-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
he claims he glitched through the elevator tho


[06-May-20 08:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I mean its possible


[06-May-20 08:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
well baby they refused to talk to him about it


[06-May-20 08:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563

not a bad thing


[06-May-20 08:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563
just saying


[06-May-20 08:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
they refused to "confront" him


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
as long as glazin just tells him to not do it again im chill with it


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but refusing to talk to him? a bit much


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
then they change the story saying they reached out to him


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I can see what they mean though


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563
like if hes not an active dev what can they do


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes yes for sure


[06-May-20 08:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
they shouldnt be at the tc and ic tho


[06-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525

[06-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
^


[06-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
ya like bman said


[06-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
no reason for suspended to be able to join ic and tc anymore lol


[06-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
it has a board to check suspension status though


[06-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
the only reason i can see why they should join is for the board


[06-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
ya


[06-May-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
what if u add the board to the hotel too


[06-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
thats why the board should be added to the hotel


[06-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525

[06-May-20 09:23 PM] ethan;#0003
i said something to her


[06-May-20 09:23 PM] ethan;#0003
right away


[06-May-20 09:23 PM] ethan;#0003
that is just


[06-May-20 09:23 PM] ethan;#0003
obsurd


[06-May-20 09:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
at least we can agree on something


[06-May-20 09:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
i never liked too strict grammar tests


[06-May-20 09:24 PM] ethan;#0003
same


[06-May-20 09:24 PM] ethan;#0003
and then the mrs take like 10 years because they dont pay attention so they can review the questions after everything is over and it takes like 10 years


[06-May-20 09:25 PM] ethan;#0003
but what annoys me the most is when lrs and mrs think they need to go over their OWN set of 10 minute rules with guests and trainees


[06-May-20 09:26 PM] bman#0435
i dont see why mrs even review the chatlogs


[06-May-20 09:26 PM] bman#0435
like


[06-May-20 09:26 PM] bman#0435
i just correct them when i see they made a mistake


[06-May-20 09:26 PM] bman#0435
i dont leave it for last minute


[06-May-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
ik


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
it just WASTES time


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
fr


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
and then why do managers need to check trainees???


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
like did the LR not pay attention???


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
and then some take like 6 interviewees and complain abt it while others have like 1-2


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
IKR


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
like they chose to take that many...


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
when a LR asks me to review a trainees answers


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
i say


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
"DId you see three grammar mistakes"


[06-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
and if she says no


[06-May-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
I say "Did the trainer see three grammar mistakes"


[06-May-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
and then he says no


[06-May-20 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
instead of a manager taking 5 extra minutes to review each and every word to make sure that everything is grammatically correct


[06-May-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
if i ever get asked i either say 1) see if a manager is available to check OR 2) ill check and just scroll through their chatlogs for anything major


[06-May-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
and if theres something minor i would just tell them but not count it as a strike


[06-May-20 09:29 PM] ethan;#0003
I dont even check


[06-May-20 09:29 PM] ethan;#0003
The Lr should be paying attention


[06-May-20 09:29 PM] ethan;#0003
not relying on the manager to do the job

[06-May-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
@stacey since the rank thing was implemented, it was raised


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it is harder to read their name


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
so it is hard ya


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i noticed that at training today


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u gotta look from a certain angle


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
@Cooqkie IS SHE COMPLAINING ABT ME ASKING HER TO GO BACK TO CANDYS SERVER?


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[06-May-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
i like the ranks added


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya i lije them too


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
at training theyre rly useful


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
maybe at interviews


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
the trainee color is she same as shift manager 😭


[06-May-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
if they are rank 1


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
we dont need to see their ranks


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ait rly


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
so then its easier to interview them


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
just a suggestion


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
did baby not transfer the chat head mover


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the no leaving servers to go to the main servers a rule right


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
whats that do


[06-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
chat should appear above the rank ui in centers


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
no because an MR is complaining to me its hard to read usernames when hes trying to review chatlogs


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
interview training


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
no its there


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
but like the bubble covers the username


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
so its hard to read the username


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats what i mean


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the head chat thing


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
yeah it covers the username


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you go to the hotel it doesnt do that


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
makes the chat bubble go above the username?


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
oooo


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[06-May-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
it does that at trainings and interviews

[06-May-20 09:42 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 09:45 PM] bman#0435

[06-May-20 09:46 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 09:46 PM] stacey#1000

[06-May-20 09:47 PM] bman#0435

@emma; oh god what did he say


[07-May-20 12:39 AM] emma;#1525
i asked him why he needed to apologize


[07-May-20 12:40 AM] emma;#1525
and he said


[07-May-20 12:40 AM] emma;#1525
MervinToday at 12:37 AM
Because I have indirectly insulted him and he knew about it. It was a few months ago. I tried apologizing but he wouldn't acknowledge.
And I really regret what I have done, it wasn't intentional either.


[07-May-20 12:40 AM] emma;#1525
im telling him that im not getting involved and if he's already apologized and minn ignored it, he shouldn't keep pushing it


[07-May-20 12:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"it wasn't intentional either"


[07-May-20 12:41 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-May-20 01:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh dear-


[07-May-20 01:20 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey are you going to talk to claire


[07-May-20 01:20 AM] stacey#1000
im waiting to get more info


[07-May-20 01:20 AM] stacey#1000
from this girl


[07-May-20 01:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was planning on talking to her


[07-May-20 01:21 AM] stacey#1000
im trying to find out who was in this gc


[07-May-20 01:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
claire basically likes messing with me in staff lounge so maybe she can take this seriously with me


[07-May-20 01:21 AM] stacey#1000
ok if you were going to talk to her anyways go ahead


[07-May-20 01:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's often very cooperative with me


[07-May-20 01:21 AM] stacey#1000
a manager doxing is concerning


[07-May-20 01:22 AM] stacey#1000
the problem is the person who reported this to me was made aware of this by a former who told them it


[07-May-20 01:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
im going to wait until you receive more info


[07-May-20 01:22 AM] stacey#1000
then she told me


[07-May-20 01:22 AM] stacey#1000
so like im trying to find out who the former is now


[07-May-20 01:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
a former-


[07-May-20 01:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
why is it always them


[07-May-20 01:23 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 01:29 AM] stacey#1000
...


[07-May-20 01:29 AM] emma;#1525
prob friends bc we didnt share a server


[07-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
huh-


[07-May-20 01:29 AM] emma;#1525
lemme delete him rq


[07-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wtf-


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] stacey#1000
ok let me unfriend him too


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] emma;#1525
do y'all not remember that


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] stacey#1000
i regret accepting his friend request now


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
no i don't


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] emma;#1525
he's the one who doxxed ellie but also threatened a bunch of girls that he'd expose their faces and stuff if they reported him


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] emma;#1525
and was overall very creepy


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] stacey#1000
.........


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
HOLD UP


[07-May-20 01:30 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ISN'T THAT THE GUY WE HAD THE CRYSTAL CASE WITH


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
so hes now reporting claire for doxing when hes the one who did?


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] emma;#1525
he also had a case with crystal


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey YES


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
WAIT


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
THAT'S PUNCH-


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
THAT CREEPY FUCKER


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
so basically


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey HE WAS THE ONE WITH THE LIST OF GIRLS HE TALKED TO


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
I shouldnt trust a word he says


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] emma;#1525
and story was on it


[07-May-20 01:31 AM] emma;#1525
yeah its punch


[07-May-20 01:32 AM] emma;#1525
why would he send you proof of someone doxxing ellie when he's the one who orignally doxxed her


[07-May-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000
so do you think all he is saying is bs?


[07-May-20 01:33 AM] emma;#1525
you should be like "You also doxxed ellie a while ago, correct?"


[07-May-20 01:33 AM] emma;#1525
to see if he lies about it or not


[07-May-20 01:33 AM] stacey#1000
ok


[07-May-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
so basically this guy was friends with them


[07-May-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
then he doxed them after gaining their trust


[07-May-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
then he causes a bunch of drama


[07-May-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; he didnt lie about doxing ella


[07-May-20 01:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
doesn't really exempt the fact that he's creepy


[07-May-20 01:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
if i recall correctly, he's 19


[07-May-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
so he specifically admitted to doxing ella


[07-May-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
"18"


[07-May-20 01:40 AM] emma;#1525
according to him


[07-May-20 01:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
um-


[07-May-20 01:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's kind of sus- @emma;


[07-May-20 01:41 AM] emma;#1525
who told you he was 19

[07-May-20 01:41 AM] emma;#1525
he didn't seem shocked when claire sent that photo to him


[07-May-20 01:41 AM] emma;#1525
in fact it seems like he said her first and last naem


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] emma;#1525
also he was kicked out over a month ago but is just now reporting this...?


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
so he admitted to doxing-


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] emma;#1525
he already admitted to it weeks ago trey


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] emma;#1525
thats not new


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] stacey#1000
yes he says he was kicked out of the groupchat march 26


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
no i know @emma;


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] emma;#1525
so did the claire thing JUST happen then


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] emma;#1525
or did that happen back in march


[07-May-20 01:42 AM] stacey#1000
march


[07-May-20 01:43 AM] stacey#1000
apparently


[07-May-20 01:43 AM] stacey#1000
he was going through old photos on his phone


[07-May-20 01:43 AM] stacey#1000
and saw it and thought he should report it


[07-May-20 01:43 AM] emma;#1525
ask him to go through his old DMs with claire, find that conversation, and take a video where he refreshes discord to prove it's real


[07-May-20 01:44 AM] emma;#1525
we already have seen the uncensored photo so its not like he's protecting her by blacking it out


[07-May-20 01:44 AM] stacey#1000
she sent it in a gc


[07-May-20 01:44 AM] stacey#1000
oh


[07-May-20 01:44 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Which me realize I should report it"


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
um excuse me


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; the photo is an old photo of what was sent in the group chat


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
you should've reported it the **day it was released**


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
so he cant see the gc anyway


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
basically


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
he doesnt have much proof to go on


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
so let me get this straight


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
nice tactic


[07-May-20 01:45 AM] emma;#1525
no but i'd still like to confront claire about it


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
kenzi and claire helps omar get promoted here


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
omar helps them at sb


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] emma;#1525
yeah honestly wild


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
snakey


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
teaaaaaaaa


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey if you're wanting to message claire just do it now


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] stacey#1000
im not getting anymore info


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't mind


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] stacey#1000
its all old evidence


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] stacey#1000
from march 26


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey can we talk strategy before you do


[07-May-20 01:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah go ahead


[07-May-20 01:47 AM] emma;#1525
well how are you planning on approaching claire with this


[07-May-20 01:47 AM] stacey#1000
I got an idea


[07-May-20 01:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
what is it stacey


[07-May-20 01:48 AM] stacey#1000
just message her and say it was brought to the HR teams attention that in the past, she sent someones personal instagram account information out, but the evidence was from awhile ago and you would like to ask her a few questions regarding it


[07-May-20 01:49 AM] emma;#1525
i personally wouldn't say it was from a while ago, i would just be like "We have evidence that in the past you searched up Ella's instagram, took a photo, and sent it to someone without her permission."


[07-May-20 01:49 AM] emma;#1525
and see what she says


[07-May-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
that works


[07-May-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
yep this guy has no more info for me


[07-May-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
because its all old photos


[07-May-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
and he was kicked out of the gc


[07-May-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
over a month ago


[07-May-20 01:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
alright let's see how this goes


[07-May-20 01:51 AM] stacey#1000
apparently claire and kenzi leaked sl to him but he has no proof of it


[07-May-20 01:51 AM] stacey#1000
so cant do anything about that


[07-May-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey ask him what part of staff lounge


[07-May-20 01:53 AM] stacey#1000
im waiting for him to tell me who leaked it


[07-May-20 01:53 AM] stacey#1000
yea he said it was both claire and kenzi


[07-May-20 01:55 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 01:57 AM] stacey#1000
hes not giving me much information on it because 1. he has no real proof of them leaking and 2. it was still from over a month ago and he remembers not a lot.


[07-May-20 01:58 AM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey im adding a card for claire on the investigation board with the proof i have and if you get anything  add it there


[07-May-20 02:02 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wanna know why he didn't reveal this up until now


[07-May-20 02:03 AM] stacey#1000
here i send what he said regarding that

[07-May-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
his excuse was too much happened during that time and he forgot about it


[07-May-20 02:04 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"I just forgot about it after all thats happened to me"


[07-May-20 02:05 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but what


[07-May-20 02:05 AM] stacey#1000
ikr


[07-May-20 02:06 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The way he worded this bothers me


[07-May-20 02:06 AM] stacey#1000
i think its because at the time he was friends with them and didnt want to report them


[07-May-20 02:06 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
See like


[07-May-20 02:06 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
That needs to stop


[07-May-20 02:06 AM] stacey#1000
and now that hes not friends with them hes reporting them


[07-May-20 02:06 AM] stacey#1000
sadly we have no real way of actually stopping people from not reporting


[07-May-20 02:07 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
If that's the message I'm interpreting then what the fuck


[07-May-20 02:07 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
So let me get this straight


[07-May-20 02:07 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
If he's friends with them, it's a-ok


[07-May-20 02:08 AM] stacey#1000
thats the way it is with a handful of people i guess, its happened before


[07-May-20 02:08 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
But the minute their friendship collapses, he decides to report them and hold them accountable


[07-May-20 02:08 AM] stacey#1000
yep


[07-May-20 02:08 AM] stacey#1000
because it was reported to me, almost 2 months later


[07-May-20 02:08 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but I would call him out for that


[07-May-20 02:09 AM] stacey#1000
and because its been so long


[07-May-20 02:09 AM] stacey#1000
he doesnt remember a lot


[07-May-20 02:09 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's no business of holding that for so long and it's so biased


[07-May-20 02:09 AM] stacey#1000
and doesnt have all the information


[07-May-20 02:09 AM] stacey#1000
idk for sure if thats why but it seems like it


[07-May-20 02:09 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm concerned on why he didn't bring it to our attention the minute it happened


[07-May-20 02:10 AM] stacey#1000
yes and I told him he shouldve reported it the day it happened


[07-May-20 02:10 AM] stacey#1000
and you saw his response


[07-May-20 02:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but like


[07-May-20 02:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
What was more important going on than discovering a Management potentially doxing


[07-May-20 02:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm genuinely curious


[07-May-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
You are wondering why a doxxer didnt think that a management doxxing was... serious...


[07-May-20 02:12 AM] stacey#1000
i cant wait to hear his response again


[07-May-20 02:12 AM] stacey#1000
im getting him to tell me the exact date claire sent the message


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
True true @emma;


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000
I feel hes not being honest with me


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 02:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think so too


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000
It's hard to get information out of him


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Something feels up but it's too early to tell


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000
he either has an excuse of he doesnt remember


[07-May-20 02:13 AM] stacey#1000
or he got kicked out of the gc


[07-May-20 02:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think the second option is more likely to happen


[07-May-20 02:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I feel like this is a way to seek revenge against whoever's in a group chat that kicked him out

[07-May-20 02:15 AM] stacey#1000
thats the date claire sent it


[07-May-20 02:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here's what I wanna know


[07-May-20 02:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The minute he sees this, he screenshots it


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] emma;#1525
i honestly dont care what his motivation is, we still need to talk to claire


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] emma;#1525
dont decide how this investigation is going to go before we even do it


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
But then decides it's a good idea to report it months later


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] emma;#1525
by saying "he's only doing it for revenge" we're already deciding its not an issue to look into


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] stacey#1000
oh here we go time to get him to stop lying


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think claire is sleeping rn


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] emma;#1525
so can we just talk to claire


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] emma;#1525
ok great so talk to her tomorrow


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] stacey#1000
ok


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] emma;#1525
and we'll continue this then ig


[07-May-20 02:16 AM] stacey#1000
so should i just stop getting bs info out of him


[07-May-20 02:17 AM] emma;#1525
yeah i mean he seems pretty convinced that what he is saying is true


[07-May-20 02:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I just basically asked her if she wanted to talk


[07-May-20 02:17 AM] emma;#1525
i love how he didnt even try to cover up her name lmao


[07-May-20 02:17 AM] emma;#1525
why would you ask if she wanted to talk-


[07-May-20 02:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma how else am I going to start to conversation


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah, the conversation with him wasn't really going anywhere.


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] emma;#1525
"I need to speak with you when you are online."


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] emma;#1525
not "do you want to talk to me" lol she's gonna say no


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nononono


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] stacey#1000
HA I WAS RIGHT HE WAS GOOD FRIENDS WITH CLAIRE WHEN SHE SENT IT


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't say that lol


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] emma;#1525
"i just asked her if she wanted to talk"


[07-May-20 02:18 AM] emma;#1525
how else am i gonna interpret that trey


[07-May-20 02:19 AM] stacey#1000
theres my answer, he didnt send it before because he was good friends with claire


[07-May-20 02:19 AM] stacey#1000
im done with this guy now


[07-May-20 02:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think we know who not to appeal in the future lol


[07-May-20 02:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think we had an MR who did something similar to this


[07-May-20 02:20 AM] stacey#1000
maybe


[07-May-20 02:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm ngl


[07-May-20 02:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
This reminds me a lot of cinder


[07-May-20 02:20 AM] stacey#1000
oh god not cinder again


[07-May-20 02:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
My god he was such a pain


[07-May-20 02:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
But think about it Stacey


[07-May-20 02:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Both usually wait at least a month or longer to basically send evidence that potentially violate the group


[07-May-20 02:22 AM] stacey#1000
yeah thats true


[07-May-20 02:22 AM] stacey#1000
its annoying when people wait over a month to report something


[07-May-20 02:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait


[07-May-20 02:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bia does that too


[07-May-20 02:22 AM] stacey#1000
yeah


[07-May-20 02:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm 100% fully convinced that Kenzi is possibly gonna resign if Claire's terminated


[07-May-20 02:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like I'm not even gonna be shocked


[07-May-20 02:24 AM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 11:41 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[07-May-20 11:41 AM] Cooqkie#2809
basically


[07-May-20 11:41 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah uh


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
basically only her location was "doxxed"


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
and seeing how she just says stuff like this


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can't really hold her accountable for this @RAMMGaming


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
holly literally doxxed herself lmfao


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i wouldnt be surprised if she said where she lived so


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ikr


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
she shouldnt be complaining


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
the only thing that could have been doxxed was her location


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
she wanted to make her tiktok the same as her roblox then thats on her


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
she probably said where that was so


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
wait rly


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] Cooqkie#2809
LOL


[07-May-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
and if she wanted to use the audio that LITERALLY doxxes u then thats ALSO on her


[07-May-20 11:43 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@RAMMGaming is that about kenzi or kenzi reporting someone


[07-May-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
about kenzi


[07-May-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
but tbh i dont see anything that would affect her


[07-May-20 11:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is this supposed to be against Kenzi


[07-May-20 11:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[07-May-20 11:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont rly think theres enough to do anything to kenzi


[07-May-20 11:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
bc most of those dont even have kenzi in them


[07-May-20 11:44 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
that's what I said to nick that there is nothing inappropriate said by Kenzi


[07-May-20 11:44 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
it shows a lot about her character but other then that I can't suspend for that at all


[07-May-20 11:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is Nick trying to report Kenzi


[07-May-20 11:45 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
yup


[07-May-20 11:45 AM] Cooqkie#2809
those only have like 3 messages from kenzi lol


[07-May-20 11:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
All they're discussing is a gc that me Stacey and Cam were in


[07-May-20 11:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They had another GC talking major shit about us in the background


[07-May-20 11:46 AM] bman#0435
kenzi is on a thin line tho


[07-May-20 11:47 AM] bman#0435
she has nothing but negative stuff coming for her if she makes 1 mistake


[07-May-20 11:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
True


[07-May-20 11:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
However I don't really see an issue with this


[07-May-20 11:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[07-May-20 01:45 PM] bman#0435
multiple people are stating she ,leaks to omar now


[07-May-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm only going to take that info with a grain of salt because many of the users who accused her aren't very reliable


[07-May-20 01:45 PM] bman#0435
so its something we sh-

[07-May-20 01:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
meme and punch


[07-May-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not saying that claire isn't potentially guilty but


[07-May-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they usually have a reputation of lying


[07-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000

Yes


[07-May-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
Did you send her the evidence?


[07-May-20 01:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000

Either way if this is true or not. Kenzi and Claire likely will never get senior because I really don’t trust them. There has been too many reports of them either being accused of causing drama, being rude, or leaking. We never had valid evidence of them leaking but it’s still something I’m concerned about

[07-May-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-May-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-May-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
thats what Im saying


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey Baby and bear have always wanted us to not be as strict with grammer and punctuashiun so i dont think periods are that bad PERIODT


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
We shouldn't be really strict with punctuation on warnings


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
but its never been an official rule


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
so can we make it an official rule now


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
We're already strict with it compared to most groups as it is


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
and  I can announce it to managers


[07-May-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
cool Ill prepare the announcement


[07-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
JUST for warnings right


[07-May-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[07-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
Ok


[07-May-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
Forgetting periods at the ends of all 3 of their warnings


[07-May-20 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
kk ill announce it


[07-May-20 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
to all of our MRs actually


[07-May-20 03:45 PM] stacey#1000

[07-May-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435
y r they so strict with that stuff lmfao


[07-May-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435
missing a period is so minor


[07-May-20 03:49 PM] stacey#1000

If not I can either repost it or put it in on the investigation


[07-May-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or just both


[07-May-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey her responses make no sense given the screenshot


[07-May-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
She seemed pretty excited based on the fact she went “THAT WAS EASY”


[07-May-20 04:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
if u dont ban lcedsins that would be great i can see when hes online if hes not banned cuz that will be his main account he uses, only ban if he like starts to exploit in a very bad away and stuff


[07-May-20 04:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@xAfroTrey


[07-May-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so apparently according the conversation


[07-May-20 05:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she found the instagram since the two accounts were linked


[07-May-20 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[07-May-20 05:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and the reason they cut him was because they caught him catfishing someone supposedly


[07-May-20 05:11 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey so she never mentioned ella doxing at all?


[07-May-20 05:11 PM] stacey#1000
becuase now shes telling me ella send a photo of lucas around to people


[07-May-20 05:11 PM] stacey#1000
because*


[07-May-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no not that i know of


[07-May-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if you're wondering what she sent me, it's these two screenshots:

o


[07-May-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
so what are you thinking now that you're speaking to her


[07-May-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
it doesnt seem like this was done on purpose but she still sent someones instagram to people


[07-May-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm not sure


[07-May-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think my idea is to basically ask her if she had permission to begin with @stacey


[07-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
ofc she didnt have permission....


[07-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
thats why ella reported asad....


[07-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
she probably didnt know claire was involved


[07-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
but if claire is the one that gave asad the picture of ella's profile and THAT'S how asad was able to leak it, that's a big problem for claire


[07-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
she should know better than to go snooping around people's private tik toks and instagrams


[07-May-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait so i think this is what happened


[07-May-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think they must've had a conversation with ella on there


[07-May-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think from that point


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
punch proceeds to ask claire to see if it was linked


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] bman#0435
i dont see how claire can have an excuse when she said "I FOUND HER" like thats just sus...


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it is


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] bman#0435
wdym it is


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it is suspcious


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
suspicious*


[07-May-20 05:49 PM] bman#0435
o i thought u meant it as in its an excuse


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
why th is it always kenzi and claire and omar is in some relations involved 🙄


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
cool ella and claire are probably both getting fired


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
ella doxxed too


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they don't seem like very good people


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
wh-


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
wait when


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah she did


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
ella sent pictures of lucas to claire without his consent


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
im questioning her now


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
did u send the proof here


[07-May-20 05:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-May-20 05:54 PM] bman#0435
apparently shes being accused of leaking to omar, and what makes it sus is that what punch said corroborates with what ive seen. he claimed that kenzi and claire are trying to get omar promoted here, and if u look at promo suggestions they suggested him at the same time...

How does she not understand this


[07-May-20 05:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm struggling to figure that out


[07-May-20 05:56 PM] stacey#1000
see I find this odd how shes reporting this now that she herself is accused of doxxing


[07-May-20 05:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Little does she know both may potentially be fired


[07-May-20 05:56 PM] stacey#1000

PULLED FROM Frequently Asked Questions
**Unfortunately, we do not allow this. Our staff members don't have the same luxuries as a hotel guest, you're required to be working at all times when at the hotel as a staff member. You are, however, able to go AFK in our staff room if you'd like to take a break. **

This is incorrect. Staff members should have the same luxuries as Hotel Guests. When there are no customers in line or at the bar area, we've decided to allow our staff to play the game as a normal player would, including using morphs outside staff areas and walking around. If a line develops, please return to work to serve our customers.

[07-May-20 06:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont like the idea of having to be there if nobody is in line


[07-May-20 06:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
especially lower populated servers


[07-May-20 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[07-May-20 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
and some reason people get introuble for getting rooms


[07-May-20 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
when they are a staff


[07-May-20 06:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
lets update this so that if theres no line, they are considered off duty


[07-May-20 06:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
and can do player-things


[07-May-20 06:11 PM] Beartikal#9760

[07-May-20 06:11 PM] emma;#1525
it makes no sense not to lol


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] ethan;#0003
i think ramm or minn needs to


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] ethan;#0003
edit the rule thing


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] ethan;#0003
they posted it


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
someone can edit FAQ unless you want me to, and maybe ping about new changes if u want


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh right


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
they have to edit it


[07-May-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
an announcement is fine


[07-May-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003
i think the rules and FAQ should just be on google docs that we are all added to


[07-May-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003
so we can edit it any time


[07-May-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003
and just have one general channel called "information" with both them on it


[07-May-20 06:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
changed


[07-May-20 06:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
the entire FAQ could do with an update tbh


[07-May-20 06:15 PM] Beartikal#9760

[08-May-20 12:08 AM] Beartikal#9760
This user was perm banned for major spamming - idk about you but that definitely is not major spamming


[08-May-20 12:08 AM] Beartikal#9760
please dont be so strict


[08-May-20 12:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
at least warn


[08-May-20 12:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
a lot of misunderstandings can come up]


[08-May-20 12:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
plus, he apologized in game


[08-May-20 12:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
and yet someone still snipped a picture


[08-May-20 12:13 AM] Beartikal#9760
smh


[08-May-20 12:14 AM] bman#0435
that was a senior who banned during a ban session


[08-May-20 12:14 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes but it was a misundrstanding thats what makes me frustrated


[08-May-20 12:14 AM] bman#0435
and ya, i agree rhat its pretty minor


[08-May-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
i dont see how that was rly a misunderstanding but id say its prty minor


[08-May-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
like he spammed, but that spamming would be a warning


[08-May-20 12:15 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[08-May-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
@Cam y r so toxic 😭😭😭


[08-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
we can make an announcement to managers not to accept reports with that type of spamming


[08-May-20 12:16 AM] bman#0435
tbh i dont like that type of proof


[08-May-20 12:16 AM] bman#0435
i could say something every 2 minutes


[08-May-20 12:16 AM] bman#0435
and it would show up in logs like that


[08-May-20 12:16 AM] bman#0435
and it can be called major spamming without actual timestamos


[08-May-20 12:16 AM] bman#0435
stamps*


[08-May-20 12:17 AM] bman#0435
i feel like chatbox or bubble is more effieicent for major spamming


[08-May-20 12:17 AM] stacey#1000
hm..we can only take proof of them actually flooding the chat as proof and not chatlogs


[08-May-20 12:17 AM] stacey#1000
yes thats what I mean


[08-May-20 12:17 AM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 02:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
do you guys still do ``CR7N`` for the Safechat Test?


[08-May-20 02:40 AM] Polk#1596
close, we do C7RN @Beartikal


[08-May-20 02:41 AM] emma;#1525
we also use the info command with that


[08-May-20 02:41 AM] emma;#1525
although its not always correct


[08-May-20 02:45 AM] Beartikal#9760
oh


[08-May-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
how does the info command detect safechat


[08-May-20 02:49 AM] emma;#1525
basic admin updated so it shows a true or false for safechat


[08-May-20 02:50 AM] emma;#1525
but sometimes it doesn't match up with the C7RN test


[08-May-20 02:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
it relies on client sided methods


[08-May-20 02:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
since its privacy, there's no 100% way to prove that they are safechatted, its inaccurate


[08-May-20 02:53 AM] Beartikal#9760
its a good rough guess


[08-May-20 02:53 AM] Beartikal#9760
you could say


[08-May-20 03:49 AM] bonnie591#0591

then resigned


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
he'll probs be fired bye bye


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
which would be a shame


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then now hes in this 70k burger king group as a hr


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
cause all of that hard work for two years, and hes gotten himself fired


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont think he put in that much hard work tbh


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821

[08-May-20 05:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hes same generation as me


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
he should've just resigned though


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
yee


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
he was head before i got head


[08-May-20 05:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
idek wwhy hes still here


[08-May-20 05:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but i can see he doesnt really care abt bh anymore


[08-May-20 05:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he probs prefer smaller groups with better chances of promotion


[08-May-20 05:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
this is what he said


[08-May-20 05:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he reached hr in echelon like in less than a year


[08-May-20 05:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ak29/04/2020
minn i might as well retire
and id take the former mr role at disc if thats possible

xM_inn29/04/2020
Aw, it'd be sad to see you go. Up to you.
Of course.

Ak29/04/2020
i kind of lost interest in bloxton yknow
as well as that i have to deal with other things such as other groups etc

xM_inn29/04/2020
Yeah I understand.

Ak30/04/2020
also u might understand that as well
but being at bloxton for 2 to 3 years on the same rank | with only 1 promotion is also getting ur motivation down
idk what i did wrong but yh


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
dk what he did wrong


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
wow


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
its called focusing on echelon and getting hr there


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
thats time wasted there


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
*maybe u weren't active buddy*


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
in the end he still resigned from echelon


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
if he'd of focused on bloxton for 2-3 months straight


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he reached chairperson rank in echelon


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] xM_inn#2821

[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[08-May-20 05:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
ok well he's getting fired, gonna wait for a couple more HRs to react tho first


[08-May-20 05:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i was dead from like march 2018 till november 2018


[08-May-20 05:16 AM] xM_inn#2821

[08-May-20 12:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-May-20 12:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they were trolling 2


[08-May-20 12:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-May-20 12:17 PM] ethan;#0003

[08-May-20 12:18 PM] ethan;#0003

bc the mrs dont know


[08-May-20 12:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they should know


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
since when were they allowed to spray in peoples faces


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
all i remember is baby said they could use the items they are given


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
but spraying people faces...?


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-May-20 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003

[08-May-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
clean counters

[08-May-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
etc


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they can spray with the watergun


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but the spray bottle is a staff item


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Not worth a suspension


[08-May-20 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Maybe just a warning

He told me it prob wouldn’t be until June


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] emma;#1525
So I put a late June date


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] Cam#5887
lowkey, if jack was still an HR, he would prolly guessed the correct date because he is "the king of HIlton"


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] bman#0435
i just had to adjust my numbers by 2 months!!!!!!


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] bman#0435
thats all!


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] emma;#1525
But I shoulda guessed early June to at least be close :(


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] Cam#5887
even tho, lets be honest he aint


[08-May-20 02:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

[08-May-20 02:39 PM] emma;#1525

remember when jack trapped you inside a box of his office


[08-May-20 02:41 PM] emma;#1525
Like when he threw a party for Stacey’s GM promo and I wasn’t invited... on my own promo day....


[08-May-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and spent 30 minutes on it XDDDDDDD


[08-May-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah because he decided to only congratulate me on general and not Emma and it was rude


[08-May-20 02:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
eh


[08-May-20 02:42 PM] Cam#5887

[08-May-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[08-May-20 02:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i just asked her two things a minute ago


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] Cam#5887
well its so damn stupid when people say "no intention" if they did it anyway


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i told her this:


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
Because we need to decide it they’re getting fired or not


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] Cam#5887
lol


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] katie#0200
yeah true lmao


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) why did you comply knowing she was not in the gc?


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] katie#0200
:facepalmz:


[08-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) did you have permission from ella sharing that type of social meida?


[08-May-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i sent it to her 9 minutes ago since i was busy


[08-May-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
I told Ella last night I had no more questions for her at the time and likely would contact her again

i would put her up for termination once i go through claire


[08-May-20 02:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000

[08-May-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
I asked Ella if she sent it to anyone else and she said no


[08-May-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
And then she said it was from January


[08-May-20 02:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she still fucking doxxed without him knowing lol


[08-May-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
The only issue I have is that it was from months ago and it was reported late and it annoys me


[08-May-20 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
Ella wasn’t even an mr but she still did it


[08-May-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think they only did it to cover themselves up


[08-May-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and plus


[08-May-20 02:49 PM] Cam#5887

When she found out it was Ella, she could’ve told her?

no because no one seemed to be bothered by it.


[08-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
@bman do you know when you brought it up bc i cant find record of you mentioning it in the past 3 months


[08-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
or in january


[08-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
i searched you mentioning "kenzi"


[08-May-20 03:44 PM] emma;#1525
i mean its not a bad idea to have a helper guide but thats annoying that she made one without asking us so


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] bman#0435
ok nvm i thought i mentioned the doc but i guess i just said it as like an overall to documents but mack did mention it in February

hmm, i think that's fine as long as she doesn't make it official or something


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] bman#0435
kinda did make it official


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] Polk#1596
or if we decide to make an official helper guide


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
well she's sending it around a a bunch of LRs are using it


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
its not like she can announce it so that's the closest to official it gets lol


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] bman#0435
link has been used in questions and mentioned 150 times in the server


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] Polk#1596
o


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
honestly its a good guide so idc if we make it "official" but she needs to get permission to keep spreading it around


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] Polk#1596
ok yeah that's a little annoying


[08-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
i guess I'll dm her


[08-May-20 03:47 PM] Polk#1596
i havent looked at it but i will take ur word for it


[08-May-20 03:47 PM] Polk#1596
its not like being a helper is that difficult


[08-May-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
ok i dmed kenzi telling her we're going to review her guide to make sure it's all correct and updated so she needs to stop sending it to people in the meantime


[08-May-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
awesome! send me the link if u can, i want to quickly read it

[08-May-20 04:11 PM] Polk#1596
a bit too many hearts for my liking, but it has a variety of good questions


[08-May-20 04:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; LOL


[08-May-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey are you still talking to claire


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
I didnt talk to ella long lol because i asked her all I needed to


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
and she gave me a bs answer of course


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
"I had no malicious intention"


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
look at the recent picture i sent @stacey


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
I saw but did she reply


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no not yet


[08-May-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[08-May-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but i still think they should both be terminated once this is all set and done


[08-May-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[08-May-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
Ill send full conversation I had with ella


[08-May-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they had no business revealing that info in the first place


[08-May-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
send it in here so i can figure out my feelings of her situation @stacey


[08-May-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
this is the full conversation I had with her, its short because I had no other questions but her response was all bs

[08-May-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ella's out


[08-May-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
mhm


[08-May-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i can't have her to be in the mr team


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
this may have been in Jan but it still never should've happened


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
its common sense not to send personal photos, or social media accs to others


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] bman#0435
wait so this was all 6 months ago...?


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Like thats not even something that would cross my mind


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] bman#0435
5-6


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
no


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
so with claire


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
her situation was end of march


[08-May-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
and ellas was end of January


[08-May-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
Ella did it before she was even on the MR team tho


[08-May-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
but she still did it


[08-May-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
and claire did it when she was a manager


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
even if it was around that time


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she fucked up her employment


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
she wouldve been fired for the same thing as an LR too so


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
when you're done talking to claire


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
we announce this


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
and they gone


[08-May-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
i dont see y ella would get punished tho if its something that happened before she became an mr and was from the start if 2020


[08-May-20 05:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
r claire and ella being fired


[08-May-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000

[08-May-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
its claire and ella


[08-May-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525

[08-May-20 05:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 05:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
i mean idk why she was even mentioned


[08-May-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
there was no evidence against her


[08-May-20 05:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-May-20 05:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omer has been pinging @ here


[08-May-20 05:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-May-20 05:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i thought the announcement said only ping the mr team?


[08-May-20 05:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[08-May-20 05:44 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 06:21 PM] bman#0435
@stacey @Cam @Tattoblue @ethan; @xM_inn apparently ManyxKiara left and rejoined the group recently and was being immature towards a cb in april, just an fyi


[08-May-20 06:21 PM] stacey#1000
when did she leave the group


[08-May-20 06:21 PM] bman#0435
ill ask emily, but the cb thing seemed pretty recent


[08-May-20 06:23 PM] emma;#1525
kenzi really resigned lmao


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
she said that in the video cory attached she was a guest, which means she left the group, was being immature towards cbs, then rejoined the group


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] emma;#1525
she never responded to my thing about her training guide


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] emma;#1525
i wonder if that has anything to do with it


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
did she acc resign


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
like


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
officially


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] emma;#1525
no idea


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
eh nvm idrc


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] emma;#1525
im gonna dm her again though and ask what her plans are for the guide


[08-May-20 06:24 PM] emma;#1525
bc its kinda immature of her not to respond when i was very nice about it and even said we liked it and just wanted to make sure it was all correct info


[08-May-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
she do be pullin a darren doe


[08-May-20 06:26 PM] Cam#5887
ok ty


[08-May-20 06:27 PM] Polk#1596
she what-


[08-May-20 06:27 PM] emma;#1525
i really hope kenzi doesnt become a toxic former


[08-May-20 06:27 PM] emma;#1525
she def has the attitude to


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] emma;#1525
just hope she stays on a better path than that


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] bman#0435
emma u know she DEF will


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] Polk#1596
she had an attitude as an mr


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] Polk#1596
im pretty sure now that she thinks she is "free"


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] Polk#1596
she will say whatever she wants whenever she wants


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] bman#0435
shes friends with omar, trashed talked before she was an mr, and had many issues involving her


[08-May-20 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
and people accused her of leaking too


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] bman#0435
and was being biased in her promotion suggestion


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg kenzi 😩 noo


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] bman#0435
as a compromise with omar


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] bman#0435
@a. ღ i hope u lying


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
what!


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] emma;#1525
do we have any actual proof of the compromise with omar


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] emma;#1525
i feel like y'all are taking that as truth when it came from asad 💀


[08-May-20 06:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
me and kenzi always played together , i mean ya shes messed up soemtimes but i still like her as a friend 😩


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] bman#0435
nope but it makes sense. if u look at promo suggestions, both claire and kenzi suggested omar at the same time


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] bman#0435
we can ask sb if they got suggestions from omar in favor of the 2


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
i like kenzi too but she was a problem as an LR (hence why she was FIRED as an LR) and has been a constant problem lately too


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kenzi was fine to me except her response to her suspension


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
i dont have a personal problem with her anymore but likeeee


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
just worried


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
same


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's going to be toxic


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] Polk#1596
u know


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i know it's going to be up ahead


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
so if kenzi is resigning


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] Polk#1596
we arent going to make that helper guide official now


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
you can bet claire will be quick to follow


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
unless we fire her first


[08-May-20 06:30 PM] emma;#1525
so we should make a choice on that


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] Polk#1596
we cant risk her writing some bad stuff


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's still not responding to my dm


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] emma;#1525
i mean at least she knows shes in an investigation so she wont get a former role if she resigns


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] Polk#1596
what did claire do


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] emma;#1525
doxxed ella

[08-May-20 06:31 PM] Polk#1596
doxing is automatic fire tho


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] Polk#1596
oh


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] emma;#1525

[08-May-20 06:31 PM] Polk#1596

[08-May-20 06:31 PM] a. ღ#4222

[08-May-20 06:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 06:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 06:31 PM] Polk#1596
okie


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] bman#0435
when shes had many past issues but accidentally doxxes 💀


[08-May-20 06:31 PM] emma;#1525
claire is claiming that she didnt know the instagram account was ellas, she thought it was some random girl bc someone sent her a tiktok link and the instagram was linked to it


[08-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
and the fact that the instagram belonged to an "ella" was weird to her but she didnt think it was MR ella


[08-May-20 06:32 PM] bman#0435
um, so she just gonna be like I FOUND HER at some random girl...?


[08-May-20 06:32 PM] emma;#1525
yeah!!!


[08-May-20 06:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@bonnie591 do banning sessions count as a session we hosted or no, cause they still take the same time as an interview or training session


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] bman#0435

o bonnie


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Plus baby doesn't like paying for negative things soo


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] bman#0435
since ur here


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
can admin acts be added in the future possibly


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that ain't negative 💀


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
if its like just hotel bans


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i want it to replace co-hosting


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] bman#0435
why doesnt hosting 2 servers count as +2 sessions


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that shit is so useless lol


[08-May-20 06:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no offense


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
ya what does cohosting do'


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
if u get paid the same amount


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
why is it a dif category


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435
cohosting is less work than reviewing apps


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435
lol


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why not just make the amount of admin acts at least 300


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Probabaly no


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
more like 100


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
thx


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think that would help us and it's actual work


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435
300 admin acts-


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435
trey r u good...


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
We might have to change the rates cuz this might be too much for baby rn


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so


[08-May-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435
bonnie can u answer my question


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
take away co-hosting


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i got paid like 500 for doing 5 things


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
which like NOT MAD ABOUT


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
but was very surprised


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Baby also doesn't like paying for negative stuff like bans and firing


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435
why doesnt hosting 2 servers count as +2 sessions


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
we dont like doing the negative stuff tho


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
but we have to do it


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean we have no choice lol


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
plus it fills up the board


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's a lot of work to keep it stable


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well baby said when we were planning it u gotta be in the server for the full time


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435
i hope u know that the mb is literally full of the same 5 people... lmfao


[08-May-20 06:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
For it to count


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
for wha to count


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
The session


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
honestly thats dumb tho


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
so if you host 2 servers


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
ur doing double the work


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
it counts as 0


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well don't complain to me


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
?


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
tf are we hosting 2 servers for then


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think co-hosting has no purpose


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
doing HIM a favor to get more people trained


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well u can put 1


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we rarely do it anyways


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
but that logic doesnt work


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since its tight


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Idk ok


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
"you have to be in the server the whole time"


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] emma;#1525
but you arent in either the whole time


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
i hosted 2 servers at once and kept hopping between servers...


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
IDK


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] bman#0435
is that not enough?


[08-May-20 06:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well u are the checklist manager after all @bonnie591


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
we might be in the server afk, but if we host two we wont be afk


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you made these when we asked for the changes


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
But im not the person who pays you


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] bman#0435
but ur the checklist person


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] emma;#1525
im fine if baby needs to decrease the pay amounts a bit bc they are kinda higher than i was expecting but that makes 0 sense, not to pay us for two servers under flawed logic 😂


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
right but what's stopping you for considering any changes lol


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes checklist person


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then again


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] bman#0435
yes


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we have more visits in the game nowadays


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] emma;#1525
ig there's no real reason to host more than one server...


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] bman#0435
i couldnt think of a better phrase LOL


[08-May-20 06:40 PM] emma;#1525
sooooooo


[08-May-20 06:41 PM] a. ღ#4222
personally if u wanna decrease the amount, i think u should not make us read 20 apps for 300 robux. at least make it like 60 apps


[08-May-20 06:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that equals more revenue sooo 💀


[08-May-20 06:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Right ill go ask baby


[08-May-20 06:41 PM] emma;#1525
20 apps is 300?????????


[08-May-20 06:41 PM] emma;#1525

[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591

[08-May-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey do we fire LRs for doxxing


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
legit question


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok lemme explain


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
I don't see why we wouldn't


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
doxxing is doxxing


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
But *do* we


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ur doing 1 session


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
like have we historically done it


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
Ive never seen a case of it so


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
i honestly dont remember


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u hosted 2 servers it takes same amount of time


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
but Like I would


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
hm


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bman#0435
not rly


[08-May-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
And ur not in both of them for full duration


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
So it counts as 1


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
interesting


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
i just dont host 2


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
too much and too stressful so


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Imagine hosting 2


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
but we technically r in the server for the full duration if 1) were doing the rules 2) we keep hopping betweeen servers and 3) were ranking them


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
they never host for me


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435
lol


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
hosting 2 servers is more work than hosting just 1 and going afk for half of it


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525
🍵


[08-May-20 06:54 PM] emma;#1525

[08-May-20 06:57 PM] a. ღ#4222

[08-May-20 06:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
[:


[08-May-20 06:57 PM] emma;#1525
wait


[08-May-20 06:57 PM] bman#0435
but im talkin bout sessions/servers not ticketts or apps


[08-May-20 06:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
sure


[08-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
y'all shouldn't be getting paid for that lmao


[08-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
if story did all the rules, ranking, etc... you didnt cohost


[08-May-20 06:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what ranking only one person passed that session lmao


[08-May-20 06:58 PM] bman#0435
wait so


[08-May-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
its not cohosting if you show up and do nothing lmao


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bman#0435
we get paid for doing half the work


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
playing games isn't cohosting


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bman#0435
while we also dont get paid for doing half the work?


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
idk why HRs are even allowed to cohost and get paid for it tbh


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
i dont co-host


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
I just host my own servers


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Would u like cohost to be removed


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
i dont either bc thats kinda dumb


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
or I host an HR's second serer


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
can we get admin acts added


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
i mean none of us even really know what cohosting means


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
No


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
No


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
No


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
bc some people think it means you host a second server


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Final time no.


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe in future


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
But now no


[08-May-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
and others think it means that you host the same server


[08-May-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
(which is the same concept as hosting 2 servers but that's not a legit thing apparently)


[08-May-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
can we replace cohosting with hosting (for GMs and BODs) or attending (Shifts) ban sessions


[08-May-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
ik bans are "negative" but they SUCK


[08-May-20 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
can ban sessions be added for GM+


[08-May-20 07:00 PM] emma;#1525
and we shouldn't be basing pay off of "negative" things when we legit have to do them to keep the group safe lmao the fun stuff doesn't help our group be good


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
If baby doesn't want to pay for negative stuff then tough


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
no it's your job to convince him


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
bans arent negative if they protect the hotel...


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
bc baby is a very understanding person


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
you just dont try hard enough


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ban sessions are volunteer-


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes I do


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
I try


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
notice how when you asked him originally for pay to be changed he said no but it took me all of 5 minutes to get him to change his mind


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Because u hack him


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
ban sessions arent exactly volunteer they use to be a requirement on my checklist


[08-May-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
like he's understanding but you have to be willing to fight for it


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
the dox was in January...?


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WHY DID THEY WAIT UNTIL MAY


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
yeah ban sessions were a requirement lmao


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don’t think baby would change his mind about bans he said many times before he doesn’t even like it when we do it


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Not anymore


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
and ban sessions takes me like an hour to do


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
He doesn't liek that we ban people?


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
well Ive still been hosting them...


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
ok great lets just not ban people


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
im not mad about that


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Good


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
because the management board keeps filling up


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
let the hotel activity drop bc so many bad people rejoin


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
over and over again


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
not my fucking problem when they lose groupfunds


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
They are gonna rejoin on alts anyway lol


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
And again


[08-May-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
ive hosted almost 3 banning sessions this week


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
so you agree lets just totally cut out our reports system


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
And again


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
And again


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
lets stop suspending and firing people too


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
since that's all so NEGATIVE


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
just let everyone do whatever they want bc its mean to stop them


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
:((((


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
We should promote our cuff abusers yes


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
Exactly


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Be positive


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
better yet


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
Let me just go promote people without asking permission while we're at it because I feel pretty negative when y'all disagree with my suggestions


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's let staff exploit at the hotel


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
there is always going to be people that try to ruin people's hotel experience


[08-May-20 07:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
As @xM_inn says "positivity is the key to success"


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Trey- LMAO


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435
.


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
so if baby doesn't want to pay us for the ACTUAL IMPORTANT work we do, what exactly is he willing to pay us for


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
now that we're not going to be paid for cohosting


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma want me to tell u how to ruin the hotel but at the same time make our group funds quadruple


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
No


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
I asked a legit question


[08-May-20 07:04 PM] bman#0435
let them take over


[08-May-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 07:05 PM] bonnie591#0591

[08-May-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
I'm so glad that our BOD is capable of productive conversation


[08-May-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-May-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
Anyways I got shit to do have fun banning for no reason bc no one wants you to anyways @stacey might as well cancel your ban session!


[08-May-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525

[08-May-20 07:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOL


[08-May-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
That wasn't something to laugh at bonnie


[08-May-20 07:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
i did a ban session and I had 7 seniors show up


[08-May-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
And the fact you di shows a lot of maturity

[08-May-20 07:06 PM] stacey#1000
but its still time out of my day to do it


[08-May-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
you do realize that when people make alts, most of them aren't the same name just slightly changed


[08-May-20 07:06 PM] bman#0435
when i was a senior i only attended 2 ban sessions and both sessions was either just me 1 other senior and the hr or was literally just me and other seniors joining last minute


[08-May-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
like it's literally impossible to track every "cb"


[08-May-20 07:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok and how many of them CBs make alts before they are even banned


[08-May-20 07:06 PM] bman#0435
the mrs make up who is and isnt a cb nowadays lmfao


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's just a really bad bandwagon lol


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
again


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
how tf are we supposed to know


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
we dont get paid to track that :)


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
are we gonna vote to disband CBs AGAIN


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hell no


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] bman#0435
no


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] bman#0435
lol


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] stacey#1000
no


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming bonnie wants to just stop banning people altogether


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] stacey#1000
it didnt work last time


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
can't have CBs if no one is banned


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
good


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
what


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] bman#0435
rmaam i think ur misunderstanding da context to this situation


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Rename CBs to BB


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
yeah apparently banning is "mean"


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Apparently bans are too strict


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
and baby doesnt want us to do it


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
and so bonnie doesnt want us to either


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
bc they just make alts anyways


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
so banning is stupid


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
ig uess


[08-May-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
i guess


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] bman#0435
we talking abt pay and admin acts and how theyre "negative" so baby doesnt want us getting paid for it


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
I mean i get that


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
how tf do you get that lmao that makes 0 sense


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
emma


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
you didnt let me


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
in what world is "you only get paid for happy things" a legitimate argument


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
finish explaining


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] stacey#1000
as I was typing


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Guys it's apparently too strict to punish people that know they're getting banned anyways


[08-May-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
ok then hurry up bc im mega stressed already and now im mad bc bonnie is being annoying


[08-May-20 07:09 PM] emma;#1525
patience has been tried tested and used up today lol


[08-May-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Honestly if I'm being honest


[08-May-20 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
I get how he views it as negative, but we have to ban people or there would be a million people bypassing the chat filter, so I view it as a positive thing


[08-May-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
THANK YOU STACEY


[08-May-20 07:09 PM] bman#0435
its negative to the person affected but positive for the group overall


[08-May-20 07:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Omg ok ill go ask baby


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
it would be great if a banning session and admin acts like (ban requests hotel and suspension/fire requests) could be added


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
Baby isn't even the issue now the issue is bonnie saying that people will make alts anyways so its stupid to even ban


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
so lets just not ban at all at that point


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
and im only half kidding


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
legit ive spent maybe 2-3 hours this week just clearing the management board


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Emma why are u taking my comments seriously


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
imag messages me again to add another banning session for tomorrow when I hosted one legit yesterday


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes Stacey


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
idk bonnie maybe because you're supposed to be someone we trust but with you being so unserious a lot of the time it's hard to tell when you're being real or when you're trying to piss us off


[08-May-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Pay attention to Imag's words of advice


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Better yet


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
promote imag


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We should switch Imag with Bonnie


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Who's with me


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Me


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435
promote imag to gm so she can host ban sessions


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] stacey#1000
I added another banning session because the board fills up too fast


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Imag would be a great hr


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
so would emily and anna


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
they'd clear the mb all the time


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
She would do all our bans and suspensions


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You forgot about Darren


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok good. Let's hire


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
what did i miss


[08-May-20 07:11 PM] emma;#1525
whos darren


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn dms


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn banning is bad we aren't doing it anymore


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You missed Claire and Wolf doxing XDDDDD @xM_inn


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
wow i missed a lot


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
ya


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The only thing about Wolf is


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Her proof was in Jan


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
I mean if claire knew that ella leaked in january and didnt report it


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
that's on claire


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
However I still don't think she should be slithering in the MR Team lol


[08-May-20 07:12 PM] emma;#1525
bc ella was an LR


[08-May-20 07:13 PM] emma;#1525
our doxxing rule also isn't public


[08-May-20 07:13 PM] emma;#1525
like it's not in our rules channel


[08-May-20 07:13 PM] emma;#1525
so idk how LRs are expected to know about a rule they... cant see


[08-May-20 07:13 PM] stacey#1000
I think because its too old of proof we cant do much


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fuck so I can't kill two birds with one stone


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That sucks


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh well


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] emma;#1525
calm down trey


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] stacey#1000
I think


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] emma;#1525
firing people isnt meant to be fun


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] stacey#1000
claire decided to report it becuase she herself was being questioned


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] stacey#1000
so she decided to try to take ella down with her


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] emma;#1525
probably but that just makes claire come off worse


[08-May-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
claire could still very well be terminated tho


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm still waiting for her resposne


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] emma;#1525
bc claire coulda brought it to our attention AT THE TIME, or at least when ella got promoted


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] stacey#1000
we cant terminate ella because she wasnt even an MR


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] emma;#1525
instead of sitting on it


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] stacey#1000
but I still had to look into it


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] stacey#1000
ok now thats solved


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] stacey#1000
ella is not getting fired


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Her excuse for not reporting is because she didn't know what "doxxing" is at the time


[08-May-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
🙃


[08-May-20 07:16 PM] stacey#1000
mhmm


[08-May-20 07:16 PM] emma;#1525
does claire even have proof of ella sending photos of lucas to her


[08-May-20 07:16 PM] emma;#1525
or did she just say it happened


[08-May-20 07:16 PM] bman#0435
there was proof


[08-May-20 07:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And while we're on the subject


[08-May-20 07:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I cyberbullied Emma without me knowing XDDDDD


[08-May-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
yeah well


[08-May-20 07:17 PM] emma;#1525
im used to it


[08-May-20 07:17 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey what time is that Boba thing tomorrow


[08-May-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2:00 PM EST


[08-May-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
when everyone is being sad that kenzi is leaving in SL and imag just barges in with a story about an essay she wrote one time


[08-May-20 07:18 PM] emma;#1525
girl read the room


[08-May-20 07:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Shhh Emma


[08-May-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let her pull a Holly


[08-May-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 07:19 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[08-May-20 07:19 PM] bman#0435
SHE SURE WILL


[08-May-20 07:19 PM] stacey#1000
tell me when to join tomorrow


[08-May-20 07:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok


[08-May-20 07:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@here no pay for admin acts 👏
Thats just something we should all be doing to keep the hotel running smoothly, not rlly pay


[08-May-20 07:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
if I pay for admin acts it gives the mindset: "If I find an excuse to ban someone I can get paid for doing so"


[08-May-20 07:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
and we are trying to minimize bans not increase them


[08-May-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
baby my man


[08-May-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i like you but


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
these people mainly harm the hotel thinking they have no consequence lol


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe you do really not trust us to have good intentions


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
really...?


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
but pay wouldnt determine if bans increase or decrease tho


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm sorry but that logic sounds too damn soft lol


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Where did I say that?


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
that logic sounds like you dont trust us to only ban for legit reasons


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I'm just saying bans should be a rarity, and it shouldnt be paid for


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
we aren't going to ban to get paid when there are hundreds of LEGIT bans


[08-May-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
bans are not a rarity


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
we have like


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
600


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
pending


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
rn


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
they should be lol


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
in a 1m group?


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
well they aren't


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] bman#0435
btw to go off topic kenzi said "you can catch me at sb" which proves omar helped her LMFAO 💀


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
you dont get to choose if they're rare or not lol


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
it's not up to us


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
so saying you wont pay us because they "should" be rare is kinda ignorant


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
bc we have 0 say in when people break the rules


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
and rn the rules clearly state what warrants a ban


[08-May-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
and so we have a lot


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
plus majority of the bans are against tos


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Well there are things that are obvious to be ban-worthy, and other things that just seem dumb to ban for


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] bman#0435
the mb gets so filled up with reports to the point in where managers have to make their own boards and wait for the mb to be cleared to add them


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
are we really about to promote that exactly lol


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
just curious


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
everything we ban for have been long-standing rules


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
we dont just make up new rules to ban for


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
it's all the standard stuff


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
bypassing, mass spamming, being inappropriate...


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] emma;#1525
we dont make it up on the fly bc we're bored lmao


[08-May-20 07:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
I joke about pay a lot, but in all seriousness I think that we would do it either way to help Bloxton but cohosting seems more unimportant rather than bans


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i gurantee you that if they do the same in roblox events


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
minority opinion: **bloxton attracts many trollers and exploiters because of security's handcuffs**
i honestly think this even though some of you may find it ridiculous


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they would be banned too


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe how are you going to call bans "necessary to keep the hotel running smoothly" but then say most bans are dumb


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
no we attract trollers bc we are a large group


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
isn't that the point lol @Beartikal


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
we honestly have LESS trollers than some other groups without handcuffs


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
that are considerably smaller


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
we just have more active servers


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
bc we are so large


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
so it seems like we have more


[08-May-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
if the handcuffs go away then im sure trollers would come less often tbh


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no it's not lol


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
they love the excitement of being caught and creating more and more accounts


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] emma;#1525
i mean that's not up to us but we're the ones at the hotel all the time


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no bear


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] emma;#1525
so we probably have a better understanding of troller's motivation for us personally


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they just want to be banned lol


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] emma;#1525
bc we've dealt with it for years


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] emma;#1525
every day


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
well idk, they must kinda like that theres a legit rank made to deal with them


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
but trollers will come no matter what at this point


[08-May-20 07:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
what would happen if they wanted to be banned and nobody bans them


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
they would leave


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
they'd just keep trying and trying


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
eventually


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
until they got banned


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's where the reports come in


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
yeah or we could ban them and end it earlier


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
i mean usually when we ban in-game, they dont return


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563
it doesnt end if they create another account lol


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] emma;#1525
yes some people do but im talking about most common case


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well baby


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563
if they leave because theyre bored, it ends


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're wasting their time and end up regretting it in like 3 months


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] stacey#1000
we've had the issue with CBs before where we stopped banning them for being a cb and they still made new accs to come and bypass because they like getting banned


[08-May-20 07:27 PM] bman#0435
a bunch of cbs are just old staff that didnt get where they wanted to be within the group, were fired or suspended, or just do it because they think its a trend


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] Polk#1596
theres some CBs that lovee to waste their time


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont know when some of bloxton's trollers got so toxic but i guess we cant help it


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's not going to make the situation improve @babymariobebe


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] babymariobebe#7563
oh yeah theres a lot of time wasters on bloxton lol


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] babymariobebe#7563
like a lot of CBs that just sit there


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what ends up happening is the complete opposite


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe All I'm saying is whether you like it or not, bans are a huge part of our job and as you even said are pretty important to keeping things running smoothly, a few groups of people who make a million accounts are NOT representative of the majority of 1-time ban recipients who move on to other groups and it's stupid to automatically assume everyone makes a second account when that's just not true for *most* people


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] bman#0435
amiee and lced have no lives 😳


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
So saying you won't pay us because "we ban too much" when we follow rules that we didn't even make bc they've been in place for years is really wild


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] Polk#1596
they always try to cause drama but i just tell them to chill and enjoy the hotel, but they arent even for the hotel part, they are just there to ruin the community itself


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[08-May-20 07:28 PM] Polk#1596
arent even there*


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
exactly polk


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we got rid of the idea of circumventing ban and it bombed


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] Polk#1596
:(


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
plus admin acts is way more than just bans


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] Polk#1596
kinda sad when i think about it


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
can we point that out


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
"bans" and "admin acts" are not the same definition


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's a lose-lose situation until they quit


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] bman#0435
also baby i have a question. so for double hosting, how come we dont mark it down as 2 sessions but we mark cohosting down? cohosting is basically 1/4th the effort compated to hosting 2 servers


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
i think we're getting rid of cohosting


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] Polk#1596
i miss like 2017 when we had no such thing as cbs


[08-May-20 07:29 PM] emma;#1525
there's legit no need for HRs to cohost


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's no purpose to it @emma;


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] Polk#1596
we had trollers but it was chill, it was enough for the security to handle


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] emma;#1525
there's no reason for seniors to cohost but i lost that battle lol


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because our group was smaller polk


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] bman#0435
there still is no reason other than for more activity comments lol


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk im telling you, everything was great until discord came into play


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
popular but not at the point we're at now


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] Polk#1596
yes and i miss it


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] emma;#1525
ever since discord became popular with roblox, people have wayyyy too much contact


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i agree


[08-May-20 07:30 PM] Polk#1596
im happy bloxton is really popular now, but it has its disadvantages..


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] Polk#1596
yeah youre right


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
it was harder to get organized groups of trollers together when you had to talk on roblox chat and everything was tagged 😂


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
but satanslilhelper was around in V3


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
so she predated discord too


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh god


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
imagine if she came around now


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] Polk#1596
BUT we cant let the trollers make it all sad


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] Polk#1596
they are the ones wasting their time


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] Polk#1596
at least harriet is wasting gher time on stapleton now


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Honestly generic trollers dont really do any harm, the main people Im concerned about are the exploiters, the chata bypassers, and the audio bypassers (if they actually bought the radio lol)


[08-May-20 07:31 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe Literally half (at least) of our 600 standing bans are probably bypassers


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
We very RARELY have actual troller bans


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
bc they just get kicked


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
oh we have tons of bypassers


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
and dont usually reconnect


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Honestly surprised roblox cant take care of chat filtering with symbols and stuff


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] babymariobebe#7563
for us


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
the most common thing we pban for is probably 1. major spamming/bypassing then 2. circumventing ban/exploiting


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
Or hire more mods to deal with it


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because roblox moderation is a mess


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe so if you agree bypassing is a legit ban, and that's prob the majority OF our bans.... why can't we get paid for bans....


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
we also get the occasional scammers that spam links to websites to steal your acc


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's no need to @bonnie591


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not understanding the argument against bans when you're literally agreeing that the bans we do are necessary


[08-May-20 07:32 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we literally have almost mrs to take care of our situations


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's why our group is in the position it is today


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
**says E** 5 times
**Senior:** this is an avenger level threat
**perm bans**

i rather not fix something that's not broken


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
seniors can't ban


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] babymariobebe#7563
oh yeah


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
🙄


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
emma, ban sessions


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
they requested that


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
yeah but that doesnt mean its gonna be approved


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
emily banned that person


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] babymariobebe#7563
IT WAS


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
it was approved


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
yeah it did


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
lol


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
emily banned them


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
ok then fire emily


[08-May-20 07:33 PM] emma;#1525
ffs


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
ONE BAD BAN means the rest are stupid


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
Seniors can ban because they can request it and then ban at a ban session. We don't check every ban a senior does lol


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
theres gonna be 1 stupid ban every now and then tho


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
So does anyone actually still want to be paid for bans bc I feel like I'm the only one fighting for it now but a lot of y'all wanted it 30 minutes ago


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
we can easily announce to seniors to not accept reports like that


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
I'm happy not to ban at all


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
I really don't give two shits


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they press ctrl+v 5 times


[08-May-20 07:34 PM] emma;#1525
But there are a lot of confusing messages here


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Chill


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she wasn't angry baby lol


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
we ban for stupid things so we aren't getting paid, bc that will make us ban for more stupid things, but most of our bans are bypassing which baby said is bad, so banning is good, but we arent being paid for banning because banning is bad


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u wanted to get paid for bans would u want tickets and applications amount to stay the same


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
oh i am angry


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
and stressed


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
or not


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
y'all caught me in a bad mood


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] emma;#1525
and no one's making a clear argument lmao


[08-May-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my thing is


[08-May-20 07:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bans are inevitable man


[08-May-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe if you dont want to pay us for bans that's fine but don't tell us that it's because you think we're gonna be more inclined to ban for stupid things. 1) its not like we'd get paid for seniors banning anyways so seniors banning for stupid things isn't even relevant 2) banning is a HUGE deal and it's not fun but we do it to protect your hotel lol


[08-May-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
What do CBs come to do


[08-May-20 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Get attention


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they also exploit, spam, etc


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
bypass


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
annoy


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435

[08-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
their goal is to not only receive but harm others trying to enjoy a good time on a much more consistent basis


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
@bman who are the ACTIVE cbs rn


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Look I have already provided other forms of making the pay, and as of right now we're not going to pay for bans. Does it mean bans will never be awarded pay? No. But as of now this is how we have it.


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
too many to list lmfao


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
i can pull out the list


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
At the minute


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
and copy and paste all of them


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] bman#0435
if u want


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
I just want the ones that are actually active CBs currently


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
baby at the very least, i think co-hosting should be out @babymariobebe


[08-May-20 07:37 PM] emma;#1525
Like we still see daily


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
25 tickets and 20 apps for 550 robux is very generous


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
k ill try to depict the ones


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Like very very generous


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; rack


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
So we don't rlly need to be paid for bans


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 everyone has agreed we are okay with the rates going down


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's not really any purpose and it's barely used


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
literally everyone


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
idk why that's even being brought up


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[08-May-20 07:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Just making a point that u don't even need to be paid for bans when u can just do tickets and applications which don't take that long


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] emma;#1525
idk it feels like we're expected to be flexible with no flexibility in return


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
those take pretty long too bonnie


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Not really


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
um bonnie


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] emma;#1525
I mean we got called out by our *owner* bc he thinks if we get paid for bans we'll just do bans "for fun that aren't valid"


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do you check the app board recently


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] emma;#1525
do you know how much that sucks to hear lmao


[08-May-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
Bans take awhile to do, even with seniors helping it can still take an hour

[08-May-20 07:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she tends to go on second servers now


[08-May-20 07:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
I get lockdown gives people not much to do but if u troll when it's not lockdown u could go and do something more productive

ma'am


[08-May-20 07:45 PM] bman#0435
i feel like alloe went to hr servers because she wanted to be noticed to get mr and then when she got promote went to secondary servers so her name gets noted down more often


[08-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
has alloe even been to a session recently


[08-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525

and spectates and stuff


[08-May-20 07:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
does that count as "co-hosting"


[08-May-20 07:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
or no


[08-May-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435
well technically no since they werent hosting, they were naming **id assume** but this pay situation makes no sense


[08-May-20 07:59 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ikr


[08-May-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435
since cohosting is 1/4th the effort compared to hosting 2 servers


[08-May-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435
but we get paid for cohosting and not double hosting

[08-May-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
alright i think im done questioning claire for now


[08-May-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's not much questions i can come up considering she summarized the majority of the storyline


[08-May-20 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
yess I hope ella_t5 goes to the hotel so I can promote her since she has 6 votes now


[08-May-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000

[08-May-20 09:25 PM] stacey#1000

[08-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hey stacey


[08-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think i'm done with the questioning


[08-May-20 09:26 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey ok heres my opinion on it

i feel that regardless on what claires excuse was, she contributed to finding ellas instagram. she also shouldnt be helping someone find someone elses personal information or accounts and then be excited about it. even though she has that stupid excuse, she helped find the instagram which could quite possibly lead to ella being doxxed. she also continued to share it with more than just the person who asked for it


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i agree


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
alright so either way she doxxed lmfao


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
It did lead to Ella being doxxed


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
whether she thinks she was the victim or innocent, she contributed to helping punch find her instagram


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
This makes so much sense now


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i did assure her that if consequences occur, i or any of the members will proceed to let her know


[08-May-20 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey add a vote for her


[08-May-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll go for it


[08-May-20 09:28 PM] emma;#1525
Bc Asad used ella’s profile as a way to threaten her


[08-May-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
omg did i just clarify an investigation to emma 😍


[08-May-20 09:28 PM] emma;#1525
Which is why he was fired and banned


[08-May-20 09:28 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 07:41 AM] Polk#1596
i was thinking i could turn my training session for today into a 1 million party


[09-May-20 07:41 AM] Polk#1596
because im pretty sure we will hit it today


[09-May-20 07:41 AM] katie#0200
yeah i think we'll hit it too


[09-May-20 07:42 AM] katie#0200
thing is i think it would be best if we do it like at the time it hits 1m even though we dont know when that is, we can make a guess but itd be so cool if we could hit it during a party lol


[09-May-20 07:42 AM] bman#0435

[09-May-20 07:43 AM] Polk#1596
i was thinking if we are around 200-100 away 2 hours before my session


[09-May-20 07:43 AM] Polk#1596
i could make it official and push it back a little


[09-May-20 07:43 AM] Polk#1596

[09-May-20 07:44 AM] katie#0200

There is like a million apps rn


[09-May-20 08:06 AM] bman#0435
also i dont think we should consider fraux for this vote. yes, he is active, but he came back 2 months ago from a years worth of activity.


[09-May-20 08:07 AM] stacey#1000
agreed


[09-May-20 08:07 AM] stacey#1000
just because hes been here longer doesnt mean he deserves it more


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
he was inactive for a long time


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
he needs a lot more time


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
I would say Candy, Lemon, Cory, or omer


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
also I think we need more seniors again


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] bman#0435
if i had to pick one of them itd def be candy


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
there is so many apps


[09-May-20 08:08 AM] bman#0435
she just stands out more


[09-May-20 08:09 AM] stacey#1000

we need more seniors if apps keep filling up like this


[09-May-20 08:11 AM] bman#0435
the only seniors i see doing apps constantly are madi and imag


[09-May-20 08:12 AM] bman#0435
so i dont think we need new seniors, its just our current seniors need to be on top of it


[09-May-20 08:13 AM] bman#0435
bruh where did cory come from


[09-May-20 08:13 AM] stacey#1000
I announced to seniors to do apps


[09-May-20 08:15 AM] stacey#1000
the seniors we have think they dont have to do apps anymore after their 30 app requirement


[09-May-20 08:15 AM] stacey#1000
probably going to make an announcement to remind them they should still be doing it when they can

[09-May-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok uh how do y'all feel about this termination announcement


[09-May-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:bloxton2: **TERMINATION OF CL2IRE** :cytoxins_gavel: 

Hey everyone. As many of you know, it is our requirement to be transparent with you all when it comes MR terminations being announced. After taking the opportunity of looking through this situation along with other HRs, we have made the final decision to release **cl2ire** from the MR Team, due to doxxing a user's social media to another individual. I know many of you are in shock right now, and I can promise you, I am too. However, I'd like to say something really fast. Do not, and I repeat, do not go out of your way to dig for someone's social media and share it **without their consent.** If the other party has no knowledge of giving you permission to begin with, don't risk it. As always, please prevent yourself from leaking this termination to non-MRs, as you may also experience a termination from your position. Thank you for your time reading this announcement, and we genuinely hope we do not have to go through more of these. 


Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

wait until the next mega update, they will have a button to press to grant them "break"


[09-May-20 12:48 PM] bman#0435
o


[09-May-20 12:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i wud love to press that button


[09-May-20 12:48 PM] bman#0435

[09-May-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435

On the "break" period, they do NOT have to use grammar, but they must maintain professionality and not do anything such as trolling, etc.


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
.


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
bet


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i bet some will go dumb and troll


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] bman#0435
@PackItUpMack lets take unlimited breaks


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
@PackItUpMack thats on them


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
r the breaks going to be timed?


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i wish


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but its not worth getting stress over the hotel while i have 6 assignments due in a month


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
😔


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
I was thinking of two options
**1) Timed breaks
**2) Trust system (press to active / deactivate)


[09-May-20 12:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
timed sounds nicer


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435
i have a DBQ ON THE 15TH UGHHH


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435
wait omg how tf has it been like 6 months already


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
im thinking of option #2 for the fact that if you dont work, you will never rank up anyway so im thinking of that one


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye time pass fast here


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] katie#0200
thing is if they go back to work afterwards and someone calls an MR to come and they see that the staff wasnt using grammar it wouldn't make a difference as to how it shows up in chatlogs like we don't know if they're on a break or not at the time they arent using grammar


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435
it does not feel like ive been an hr for 6 months tf


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats correct you cant assume that they are on a break in that case @katie


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
that would be harder to weed out


[09-May-20 12:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ive been hr since september but i still feel like a baby


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
but at the same time


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
maybe we can like


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
you cant say they *arent* on a break


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
require them to say "on break" in chat when they start their break and when they end it say "break ending" or something


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so we can tell easier


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
true


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
perhaps thats a better idea


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
nice


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
thinking


[09-May-20 12:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
:D


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
can i get some cookies


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
might make me smarter


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
no


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] katie#0200
we should add a lil thing above their head if theyre on break maybe so that staff dont report them if they dont use grammar


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
ONEEE MILLLION🥰🥰🥰


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] bman#0435
bear can u make it so that when a staff on break chats it says like “BREAK” mext to their name so they dont get reported for lack of grammar


[09-May-20 12:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
@Beartikal @babymariobebe CONGRATSS 😭😭😭😭😭😭🥰


[09-May-20 12:54 PM] emma;#1525
Me casually voting for 1 HR against everyone else lol


[09-May-20 12:55 PM] bman#0435
i voted 1 then changed to 2 so we have a full hr team lol


[09-May-20 12:55 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think we need 2 right now, I personally think it makes more sense to hire 1 now and then if we need another one later do it then


[09-May-20 12:55 PM] emma;#1525
Rather than hire 2 rn just bc we’re all excited about 1M but not actually need them


[09-May-20 12:56 PM] bman#0435
thats what i kinda thought but if we have 2 then we basically have everything set out for us and we dont need to worry about bringing a new one in later


[09-May-20 12:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
r we gonna hire 2 new seniors after we get the new shifts? @bonnie591


[09-May-20 12:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
2 ftw!


[09-May-20 12:56 PM] emma;#1525
idk I think we do better with single promos Bc we can focus on the person


[09-May-20 12:56 PM] emma;#1525
like when we hire multiple at once that’s two people who have no clue what they’re doing at the same time haha


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe cookie


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ooo


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] bman#0435
well when i was promoted to senior with stacey we figured everything out together


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] emma;#1525
but again I just done think we *neeeeeeed* two


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] bman#0435
saved everyone else from a bunch of questions


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i mean


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] bman#0435
well we dont *need* any right now


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] bman#0435
we didnt lose anyone


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont rly think its that hard to learn how to do "hr stuff"


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] bman#0435
but itd be nice to have more


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc they already know how to host


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and they can do bans


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
etc


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] emma;#1525
that’s the easy stuff


[09-May-20 12:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
@emma; omg i want one too mainly because idk who to vote for


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
tbh hr stuff is a big leap from senior stuff


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ omg vote for 1!!!


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Bans take hours


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
I’m throwing a coup


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
OKAY


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
but if we do 2 people theyd figure it out together


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
like who are the possible people


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
uh they should be asking us


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Its just the terminations that


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
Bc this isn’t stuff you can “figure out” easily


[09-May-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
how many questions do we still ask each other bc we have no idea what’s going on 😂😂😂


[09-May-20 12:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Welp rip a lot of people were shocked about Claire's termination


[09-May-20 12:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
honestly ya i have no fucking clue whats going on


[09-May-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
@bman if you don’t think we even need any new HRs why did you vote 2


[09-May-20 12:59 PM] emma;#1525
we shouldn’t be hiring just to fill spots


[09-May-20 01:00 PM] bman#0435
i literally said why


[09-May-20 01:00 PM] bman#0435
“thats what i kinda thought but if we have 2 then we basically have everything set out for us and we dont need to worry about bringing a new one in later”


[09-May-20 01:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@katie moody joined


[09-May-20 01:00 PM] emma;#1525
“It’d be nice to have more”


[09-May-20 01:00 PM] emma;#1525
Soooo you’d rather hire two people who we aren’t super sure about NOW so it’s over with


[09-May-20 01:00 PM] emma;#1525
Rather than wait to  feel more secure later...


[09-May-20 01:01 PM] bman#0435
no? lol


[09-May-20 01:01 PM] emma;#1525
Then what’s the point of hiring now, having things “set out” isn’t really a concern


[09-May-20 01:01 PM] a. ღ#4222
i join the hotel for one minute and vedom is already here


[09-May-20 01:01 PM] bman#0435
what abt the senior do you feel insecure abt having on the hr team


[09-May-20 01:01 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t personally feel concerned about a couple options but y’all literally have said you hate most of the team


[09-May-20 01:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@a. ღ DADDY VEDOM OMG


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525
I mean I don’t like quite a few of them


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
who


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525
Even some of the names thrown around today


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] bman#0435
ive stated 4 seniors i wouldnt mine having on the hr team


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wasn't exactly thinking about 2 because I want the spots filled lol


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
@RAMMGaming shut up 😩


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525
I disagree with Cory


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] bman#0435
the rest i feel arent ready


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] bman#0435
y


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Same here


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
isn't ready


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
His maturity is getting much better though


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525
Bc literally all he’s done his whole MR experience is be friends with CBS


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] bman#0435
hes always been mature tho


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] emma;#1525
as they’re ACTIVE cbs


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
thats ironic


[09-May-20 01:02 PM] bman#0435
o i never noticed that


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Swan and Sadder??


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] emma;#1525
yeah he was bffs with Kaylee and sadder when they still trolled here


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
don't you guys talk to cbs :blue_think:


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
swan and sadder arent even active cbs


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah we did


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
a bit ironic to say that they aren't ready for it based off that


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
if you guys were doing the same thing


[09-May-20 01:03 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t talk to CBS lmao


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] emma;#1525
I literally told everyone to leave CB discord servers


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] emma;#1525
🤦🏼‍♀️


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
im not saying you


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Im syaing the HR team


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I left before you told us


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That was my fault ngl


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] emma;#1525
which HRs are friends with CBS


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] bman#0435

[09-May-20 01:04 PM] emma;#1525
Talking once or twice is not the same as being friends


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
there were a bunch in a server


[09-May-20 01:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 01:05 PM] a. ღ#4222

[09-May-20 01:05 PM] emma;#1525
They stalked us


[09-May-20 01:05 PM] bman#0435
BECAUSE SHE ANNOYED US?


[09-May-20 01:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They followed us ramm

[09-May-20 01:05 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming I got banned for a week Bc I left when Harriet harassed us on firestone and I was in cuffs


[09-May-20 01:05 PM] emma;#1525
So don’t make assumptions


[09-May-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821

Cus you guys invited me


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 01:06 PM] emma;#1525

[09-May-20 01:06 PM] emma;#1525

[09-May-20 01:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

Ramm can you fact check stuff


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Are you talking about the first generation lol


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] emma;#1525
Or remember the whole situation


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] bman#0435
y r u bringing stuff up from like 4-5 months ago lol


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I am


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'm not lying at all


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] emma;#1525
Yes we talked to sadder and Kaylee once upon a time but cut them off when it got serious


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] emma;#1525
Cory kept talking to them and joining their servers behind our backs


[09-May-20 01:06 PM] emma;#1525
Even after we explicitly asked him not to


[09-May-20 01:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok that's fair


[09-May-20 01:07 PM] emma;#1525
And none of us have been friends with them since


[09-May-20 01:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but that shouldn't be an ENDING factor


[09-May-20 01:07 PM] emma;#1525
He’s lucky he’s not fired


[09-May-20 01:07 PM] emma;#1525
That’s his compromise

[09-May-20 01:09 PM] emma;#1525
And chilled out


[09-May-20 01:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-May-20 01:10 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming Yes we were in kaylees discord server no one is denying that lmao but when they changed for the worse we stopped talking to them and made the MRs leave and Cory still snuck behind our backs so stop comparing us to Cory when the situations aren’t the same and we legit didn’t punish Cory for it


[09-May-20 01:10 PM] a. ღ#4222
IVE HAD ONE LIKE THAT BEFORE THAT I GOT PROMOTED TO SENIOR


[09-May-20 01:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Last time i had roblox dreams was 2 yrs ago


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] a. ღ#4222

[09-May-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack that sounds wrong


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Its that


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But doesn't matter


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-May-20 01:11 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Deja vu


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ahhh


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
wdym be more clear


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
Bc I have no idea what you’re on about then


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
they were CBs


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
Not always lmao


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Remember when yall were meming about that lmao @emma;


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and we had Hrs doing the samew things seniors are doing now


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No we're not lol


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
shouldn't be a deciding factor


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
They became well known once they were CBS but they weren’t always


[09-May-20 01:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I tend to avoid them actually


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
there are OTHER factors


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
It should be actually


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
than just talking to CBS


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think im the only one who has 0 interaction


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
BAHAHA ok then\


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
Trusting CBS is a security concern


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
Cory wasn’t just talking to them


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
have they leaked?


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
May I see that proof?


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That's the sceurity issue


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They don't leak, it ain't my problem


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
I mean plenty of people were leaking to Kaylee but she never told us who it was


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
🤷🏼‍♀️


[09-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
Why do you think we shutdown SL so much


[09-May-20 01:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-May-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-May-20 01:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 01:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
yes


[09-May-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm at the boba awards


[09-May-20 01:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
vedom ruined the moment tho


[09-May-20 01:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ew


[09-May-20 01:14 PM] emma;#1525
I’m pretty sure Cory also befriended iced a few months ago but let me look for that “report” Bc I don’t want to falsely advertise that


[09-May-20 01:14 PM] emma;#1525
Ik 2 MRs did befriend him


[09-May-20 01:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
ice was a girl 😩


[09-May-20 01:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ok that's a fair point


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
if there is proof they are a security risk, I'm all for not voting


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] emma;#1525
idc what Iced’s gender is they’re a bitch


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not choosing him since I don't think he's my first choice


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] emma;#1525
Ramm would you even vote for Cory over other options anyways


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I just have others in mind


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but saying they are talking to CBs without seeing what they are disclosing then it isn't fair to say they are a threat


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe next time


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I'm not voting for corry


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
at all


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
There are others I have in mind


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] emma;#1525
Ok then it’s a non issue bc neither are we


[09-May-20 01:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ok


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Candy is probably going to have my vote


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] emma;#1525
I wasn’t voting for him regardless bc there are other people I support more rn


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Anna is one of mine for sure


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] emma;#1525
good luck


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 01:16 PM] emma;#1525
Candy is prob one of mine


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Active, usually timid but talks when needed, mature, and has no issues as far as I recall


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
she is a good candidate


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] emma;#1525
I’d vote fraux but I don’t think he’ll have enough support


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] emma;#1525
I’d vote lemon too


[09-May-20 01:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I want Fraux aswell


[09-May-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But lemon would be a nice addition also


[09-May-20 01:17 PM] emma;#1525
he was active for a year before his laptop broke and now he’s been active for a few months


[09-May-20 01:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Not his fault but others have had more consistent activity.


[09-May-20 01:17 PM] emma;#1525
not having enough money to replace a computer sucks but ik most of the team thinks it’s too soon


[09-May-20 01:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True but they do have each of their problems as well


[09-May-20 01:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
such as?


[09-May-20 01:18 PM] emma;#1525
I mean his activity was and now is consistent


[09-May-20 01:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright so here we go


[09-May-20 01:18 PM] emma;#1525

[09-May-20 01:18 PM] emma;#1525

i mean we are getting like thousands of apps now and weve had to ask seniors to do apps a lot recently


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They do more than the whole damn HR team combined


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But now they are toning it down too much


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] emma;#1525
They aren’t leaders


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ya they keep to themselces too much


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
AND THE FUCKING TRIGGER


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ITS EITHER WE BOTH GET SERVER


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming fuck no they don’t


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
OR WE DO IT TOGETHER


[09-May-20 01:20 PM] emma;#1525
Ok they do sessions and apps whoop de doo


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
So do plenty of other seniors


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They shud interact with the othrr mrs more


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
I’d like to see more actual leadership


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They technically do but


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Selected only


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They lack some leadership qualities I'm looking for


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They just like


[09-May-20 01:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Are too tied together


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Fraux started becoming consistent after March 27th.


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They have to be independent workers and be more leader and outstanding


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Very consistent activity but not my first option


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
aka CORONA VIRUS


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
Aka when he got a new laptop


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well yeah


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL ok emma


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
Bc his broke and couldn’t afford a new one


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's when he got a new PC


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
It wasn’t bc of corona

[09-May-20 01:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 01:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We weren't in quarantine yet ramm lol


[09-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
Ok then he got his laptop earlier


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ya


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
month later started becoming active


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
Was anyone this active before corona tho who ISNT HOMESCHOOLED


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
aka school closings began


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn's homeschooled lol


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] bman#0435
test


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
No i think it was pretty dead before corona


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
wow people were more active once they didn’t spend 8 hours a day in school


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
Shocker


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
Really got me there lol


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Lol i rather spend time on online school


[09-May-20 01:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Assignments are no jokes


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
Isn’t she homeschooled


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Anna and Emily are both homeschooled


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Anna and emily are both homeschooled


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So?


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
Exactly


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; whats wrong with anna and emily


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That means they are available more


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
That has to be taken into account lmao that’s why they can be way more active


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
YOURE MAKING MY POINT LOL


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
That doesn’t mean they deserve it more


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
IT SHOWS MORE CONSISTANT ACTIVITY


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
whatd i miss my discord on mobile broke


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
oop imma head out


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
shift debate?


[09-May-20 01:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Theyll probably hate some ppl here anyways


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] bman#0435
candy and llys ftw B)


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think I'd like to see more leadership from them to be fairly honest


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i mean


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Their presence in thr chat history is huge


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
So bc they are MORE available they deserve it more even tho it’s probably not their own fault they’re homeschooled, but fraux who’s family couldn’t afford to replace a computer is his own fault for not being active lol


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Whereas candy basically does the opposite


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So probs they wont open up much to us


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
just bc they dont talk to that many other mrs doesnt mean they arent leaders


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
when i was an mR


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
What make's his over theirs?


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I barely talked to MRs and HRs


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
I’ve already said I don’t think fraux will win


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc they were sort of intimidating but im here so


[09-May-20 01:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Because he does themed sessions with you guys?


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Is that the reason behind this?


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I saw it a few times


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
I just think it’s funny you’re praising Emily and Anna for things that they didn’t decide but condemn fraux for the same


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
when i got shift i got more comfortable so i dont think judging their leadership socially is really fair


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
I’m sure most of our seniors would be that active if they were homeschooled


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435
just an fyi someone may have leaked claires termination but it wasnt the same reason this lr thinks so ya im still sending it here


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
can I see please?


[09-May-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435

Oop Koala won the alliance award


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Also why do we need 2 new HRs?


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's a rip


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey exactlyyyy


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It could help us clean up the board more


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t see why we need 2 at once


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] emma;#1525
I vote for 1


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's it


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Like


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey that’s what banning sessions do


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
can I make a new role in DC


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's the only benefit I got


[09-May-20 01:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
saying ban hammerer

[09-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
It’s going to be hard to get sesssion times if we get 2 at once


[09-May-20 01:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
:banhammer:


[09-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
We don’t need 2 rn


[09-May-20 01:57 PM] emma;#1525
#VoteForOne!!!


[09-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
What’s your argument for wanting 2


[09-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
Like for real


[09-May-20 01:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Candy honestly wins for me if we stick with 1


[09-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
You can’t argue saying it’s a 1 mill group either that needs more HRs


[09-May-20 01:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then how about we sell ranks @stacey


[09-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
But like why do we need 2


[09-May-20 01:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then we'll get 2M members 😎


[09-May-20 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
I’m legit going to tag everyone and ask why they voted for 2 to hear why they think we need 2


[09-May-20 01:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
See I'm a genius


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
Because all I hear out of it is it will be hard to get session times we want


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
i dont think session times are an issue considering theres only 3 sessions scheduled for tomorrow lol


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
just schedule them in advance


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
Because I haven’t planned mine yet


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman we're not even in the voting stage yet lol


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i schedule a week in advance


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
wut


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
i know?


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
lol


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
But we still don’t need 2 new HRs still


[09-May-20 01:59 PM] bman#0435
im just telling stacey y i dont think sessions is an argument this time


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
So what’s your argument for voting for 2


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
Because I still don’t see why we need 2


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
We’ve been fine on sessions


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
We have had sessions every day


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Look guys


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
well i dont see a reason not to have 2. 2 would be more helpful in general and would be a better set of eyes


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think we just need Emily and Anna and everything is ok 😎


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like 2 at once is not something we need


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
imag and darren wym


[09-May-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Naw man


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
We haven’t had any issues honestly


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t see how 2 is more helpful when we legit aren’t really struggling BUT that’s just me


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] katie#0200
BST needs help lol


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bearvish and Maddy


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
well if we arent struggling with anything then why not have 2 lol


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Bc it’s not needed...?


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
We don’t need any new shifts for est


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Why hire someone for a job we don’t need filled


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
isn't candy cst


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
having another hr at the moment isnt needed to start off with


[09-May-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
or am i just stupid


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
but itd be nice to have 2 new shifts


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought candy was BST lmao


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
I mean I don’t want any new HRs right now for that reason lol but if we’re hiring it doesn’t make sense to get 2 if we don’t even think we need one


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
probably not though


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
We can’t just hire new HRs because it would be nice to. We should only hire new shifts when we actually need new HRs


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
We don’t need any new HRs right now


[09-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
Like I’ve been fine hosting banning sessions when the manager board fills


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So what now


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
were a 1 mil group now, were going to need more hrs to be available and overview the group as a whole


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Do we just vote out


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
1M and 975k are hardly different and there wasn’t a push for it then


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
Bman saying we are a 1 mill group is not a valid argument. We are still doing fine.


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
neither is sessions


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
Doesn’t matter the member count. It matters if we actually need an hr at the moment


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
Which we don’t honestly


[09-May-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sessions are just fine rn


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
I’m saying if we hired candy right now for example


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No issues in that regard


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
She’s cst


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
She will host around times I usually host


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
And as for the management board filling


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525
I just think it makes more sense to hire one at a time ALWAYS because then we’re cycling them in slower, we can give them more attention, and we decrease the risk of a bunch of HRs who were hired at the same time resigning at once lol


[09-May-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
I’m fine with hosting banning sessions


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe I should resign :thinkception:


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
bet


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If any of you celebrate


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm shooting you guys in the foot


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yay


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
Y’all only added a vote for a new hr because we hit a million but do we actually need any right now


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:pika_gun:


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
My opinion we don’t


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ramm


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's play a game of


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
ok so instead of voting 1 then vote 0


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
lol


[09-May-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do you want to die


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
trey


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
The vote for 2 won already but like why do we need 2 rn


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
For everyone who voted 2


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
State your case why you voted 2


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435
hasnt rly been made official as the list was never created, u still have time to convince others to vote for 1


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435
or for none


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what ever happened to clarity @xAfroTrey didn’t she get voted for a suspension


[09-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
So why did you vote for 2


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435
@Bloo_Berriez she is suspended


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She doesn't get unsuspended until today


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the one who went off at trainings right


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause there’s 2 lol


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Or the one that just got fired today


[09-May-20 02:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Claire


[09-May-20 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
If we do get a new hr we should consider timezones


[09-May-20 02:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i fired claire due to doxing


[09-May-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
We don’t need an HR for est or cst


[09-May-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
We should get one for bst


[09-May-20 02:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
clarity was suspended due to going off at trainings


[09-May-20 02:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm surprised claire didn't respond yet

[09-May-20 02:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think stacey is perfect for shift


[09-May-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
Because as I said before we don’t need any HRs for est or cst


[09-May-20 02:15 PM] katie#0200

[09-May-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
And now I’ve seen him do nothing as a rank 8 for over a month


[09-May-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
And then I go look and there he is on Stapleton


[09-May-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000

trying to tell me how to do my job


[09-May-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
im not going to announce to all managers to do reports when its not even a major major overflow, she can easily ask managers in management lounge to do reports


[09-May-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
omg 20 reports not done is an overflow!!!!!

i love this paragraph because ITS SO TRUE


[09-May-20 05:51 PM] emma;#1525
no, i’m not one of those people who are like “bLoxTon meSseD uP mY aCadeMicS” like sis theres something called time management, something ur just probably not good at if u cant balance ur time well between a virtual hotel game and school or its just that u choose to blame everything on this group because lets be real here, how did you balance your time out between doing shifts at the hotel and attending trainings 🤩🤩 i know u hate it, and im not sorry but im always correct

some of the paragraphs are way too toxic


[09-May-20 05:56 PM] bman#0435
she was a toxic person


[09-May-20 05:56 PM] emma;#1525
i mean she spilled the tea so i respect that lmao at least she didnt blame BH for all her problems like other formers have 😂


[09-May-20 05:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe we should hold off for a bit regarding her appeal chances


[09-May-20 05:56 PM] bman#0435
3. yall are fr thirsty😘😘🤧
can my friends be like those people who dont give a total crap about what i say and wont be like “omg ill report her so my chances increase 😍😍” y’all are so thirsty its actually pretty hilarious to watch i know so much about certain mrs but have i ever brought it up to an hr? no i have only brought up like 5% of what i know but whatever i guess i saved ur rank so thank me x yk sometimes i just sit there and watch the chat go on and mind me not laughing at u there, but i do so in peoples dms 🌿🌿 but piece of advice, dont be one of those people whos two faced; one minute ur preaching this boy like a god and the next ur calling him a piece of trash LMFAO IMAGINE and ur older than me which is embarrassing if u ask me 😋 and then the fact— LMFAO ILL SAVE THE EMBARRASSMENT BYE

[09-May-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 05:58 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 05:58 PM] emma;#1525
i still think its hilarious lol


[09-May-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435
im kinda happy she admited she was terminated and didnt say she resigned


[09-May-20 05:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think its a bit bitter tho


[09-May-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but then again


[09-May-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i fired her sooo


[09-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
thats one of my biggest pet peeves with mrs that get terminated


[09-May-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
its expected


[09-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
when they say they resigned hut were really fired


[09-May-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
at least she accepted it (but not really)


[09-May-20 06:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think she made herself look kind of bad here lol


[09-May-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe im overthinking this who knows


[09-May-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
at least she was honest about things i mean id be a hypocrite if i didn't admit that everything she said i totally agree with


[09-May-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
i mean she didn't hate on BH at all so that's a pretty good step


[09-May-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
except the MRs a tiny bit


[09-May-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
but they're annoying so


[09-May-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
deserve it


[09-May-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@RAMMGaming did you ban her from the discord


[09-May-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
because I am


[09-May-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
if you havent yet


[09-May-20 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
she is threatening to basically cause drama in the discord and is being real immature and complaining over ella getting rank 8 and her ban was a real legit reason, she bypassed and major spammed like heck


[09-May-20 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
shes never getting appealed anytime soon


[09-May-20 07:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 07:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
before I could ban her


[09-May-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
I banned her


[09-May-20 07:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
DOPE


[09-May-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
she wanted to go spam in the discord and complain about why she was banned


[09-May-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
and complain about ella getting promoted


[09-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-May-20 08:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
what im saying


[09-May-20 08:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
is that if we allow cursing again in general


[09-May-20 08:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats what would happen


[09-May-20 08:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[09-May-20 08:11 PM] emma;#1525

[09-May-20 08:11 PM] Beartikal#9760

[09-May-20 08:12 PM] Cam#5887
LOL


[09-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
its not toxic if it's not aimed at people


[09-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525

[09-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525
they can't be cursing each other out


[09-May-20 08:12 PM] emma;#1525

[09-May-20 08:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
because i have something


[09-May-20 08:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
pretty important


[09-May-20 08:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
we call a reputation


[09-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525
imagine if bear got banned from roblox for cursing


[09-May-20 08:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
so that if i even say one thing


[09-May-20 08:13 PM] emma;#1525

The reason that the high ranks only have control is simple -- to prevent corruption and extreme power, as the chairman has complete control over the group, the Discord, and everything else -- except the Twitter account.
Twitter


[09-May-20 08:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
i mean isnt it natural that the owners own the social media


[09-May-20 08:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
🤔


[09-May-20 08:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
cytoxin left that account locked and we never got it back


[09-May-20 08:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
so it just sits there and rots


[09-May-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
lol


[09-May-20 08:24 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal he swore up and down to me that he gave you and baby the password lmao


[09-May-20 08:24 PM] emma;#1525
which we all know is obviously not true


[09-May-20 08:25 PM] emma;#1525
idk why he did that 🤷‍♀️


[09-May-20 08:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
and he did but it was locked by a verification to his phone, which we did not get word back on

[09-May-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[09-May-20 08:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
this is why i dont give resources to HRs no offence because they can run away with things critical to the group's health


[09-May-20 08:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
as far as accounts and stuff


[09-May-20 08:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
but ya this is old news


[09-May-20 08:30 PM] Beartikal#9760

[09-May-20 08:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[09-May-20 08:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Fucking Cyto reset everything


[09-May-20 08:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And I was threatened to give it up


[09-May-20 08:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So when I did then he locked out everything


[09-May-20 08:33 PM] bman#0435
why does he have the honor role if he sabotaged the bloxton social media accounts

@RAMMGaming he got so pissed at me too bc i kept "harassing" him on snapchat (since he wouldn't respond to anyone on discord) about the twitter like BITCH WE KNOW YOU HAVE IT


[09-May-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
we aren't dumb


[09-May-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
"i gave access to two seniors and random HRs" no tf he didnt


[09-May-20 08:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
not like it matters we have main twitters to shout updates anyway


[09-May-20 08:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
would be cool to have bloxton stuff under one ig


[09-May-20 08:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[09-May-20 08:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
plus ur's and baby are popular bois on twitter tho


[09-May-20 08:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes yes


[09-May-20 08:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but your right


[09-May-20 08:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It's whateve


[09-May-20 08:40 PM] bman#0435
what if we made a new bloxton twitter


[09-May-20 08:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
didn't he give it to two seniors @emma;


[09-May-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
no


[09-May-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[09-May-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760

[09-May-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
it has never even been used


[09-May-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[09-May-20 08:45 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey no im sure he just said that to be his dramatic self


[09-May-20 08:46 PM] emma;#1525
or maybe that's what he wanted to do, but he also said that baby and bear were gonna give his pay to seniors and that didn't happen bc, oh wait, ryan doesnt get to make rules up lol


[09-May-20 08:46 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
he gave it to me


[09-May-20 08:46 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and then bear took it


[09-May-20 08:46 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and cyto found out


[09-May-20 08:46 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and then locked it


[09-May-20 08:47 PM] emma;#1525
🤷‍♀️


[09-May-20 08:47 PM] emma;#1525
we can always make a new one if needed


[09-May-20 08:48 PM] Beartikal#9760

apparently vun1x or whatever (the mr) is "good friends" as they say with Sooty and rack


[09-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
idk why these MRs think being friends with cbs is a good idea lmao why would you even want to be friends with someone who's whole goal is to make your life harder


[09-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
so apparently


[09-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
this child


[09-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
thought it would be a brilliant idea to comment on his friend Rack's tiktok and basically encourage her/him to keep CBing essentially

yikes


[09-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey lemme get your opinion on this pls


[09-May-20 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; so you spoke to them?


[09-May-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
he came to me about it


[09-May-20 09:27 PM] emma;#1525
so he was upfront and honest


[09-May-20 09:28 PM] emma;#1525
and realizes it was wrong


[09-May-20 09:28 PM] emma;#1525
just wanted to bring it up bc its still a bit concerning in my mind


[09-May-20 09:34 PM] stacey#1000
its good he was honest about it


[09-May-20 09:34 PM] stacey#1000
we shouldnt punish him for it


[09-May-20 09:35 PM] stacey#1000
I mean he never violated any major rules but I guess keep an eye on the situation and its good we are aware of it now


[09-May-20 09:36 PM] emma;#1525
I'll prob just give him a verbal warning and remind him that encouraging CBing is no bueno


[09-May-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435
wait isnt vuni a gurk


[09-May-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435
girl


[09-May-20 09:37 PM] bman#0435
who r yall warning @emma; @stacey


[09-May-20 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
yes that girl


[09-May-20 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
yeah all u can really do is warn them


[09-May-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
its not a major enough offence to fire,


[09-May-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
ya i dont see yshe would be punished for befriending them because if anything her being friends with them could be seen as a good thing as she can convince them to stop


[09-May-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
true


[09-May-20 09:43 PM] bman#0435
tbh i talk to sadder and swan every once in a while because theyre moderators/admins in my groups discord server and they learned their lesson and havent been at bloxton since i got promoted, which was NOVEMBER. i wouldnt of had accepted them if they had continued but considering they learned to leave us alone and go their own paths while respecting our group is something i appreciate with them but thats the only "real" friendship i have with "active" cbs who havent been active for half a year lmfao

Guys should we let megan wear any uniform she wants to? Pesonally I wouldn't mind considering she did all this for us. But idk if you guys would want that, up to you guys since you're the HRs wearing the unis.


[09-May-20 10:43 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Thoughts?


[09-May-20 10:43 PM] babymariobebe#7563
You cant really withhold her from her own creation thats kinda mean idk


[09-May-20 10:43 PM] bman#0435
no, she should wear the one that coordinates to her rank. we cant let her wear the female/male hr uniform when other mrs cant lol


[09-May-20 10:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I want the uniform to be replaced lol


[09-May-20 10:43 PM] babymariobebe#7563
well considering she's the designer thoughhh


[09-May-20 10:44 PM] bman#0435
i get she made them, but she should wear the one that coordinates to her rank


[09-May-20 10:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-May-20 11:04 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 11:04 PM] Cam#5887

[09-May-20 11:04 PM] bman#0435
which is just


[09-May-20 11:04 PM] bman#0435
ugh


[09-May-20 11:04 PM] stacey#1000
and for them to say "oh our devs dont represent our group we cant do anything'


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why can't they just announce it 💀


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
ever since that


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] bman#0435

[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
i dont want to be allies with them


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
first it was harriet


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
then their lrs come and troll at the hotel and they tell us they cant do anything because they arent an mr and dont represent the group


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
then the dev glitching at the hotel and they dont care about that either


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
and now this


[09-May-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000

[09-May-20 11:06 PM] stacey#1000
they've shown they dont care about their relationship with alliances


[09-May-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
idc that im a rep there, they clearly dont gas about anything lmfao


[09-May-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
or their own community


[09-May-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
lol


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] stacey#1000
their LRs can troll at allies and yet they care if one of our LRs trolls there they want us to take action....?


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
and thats the bad thing


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
as allies


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
we needa


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
take care


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
of each others staff


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
as in


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
if we see something report it


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
like for instance, a couple weeks back


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
2 LRs were like supposedly messing around


[09-May-20 11:07 PM] Cam#5887
and the MR just didnt give a shit


[09-May-20 11:08 PM] Cam#5887
and reported them to me with absolutely no proof


[09-May-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
we dont even need them as an alliance


[09-May-20 11:08 PM] Cam#5887
if they are using us just for


[09-May-20 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
like how are they benefitting us


[09-May-20 11:08 PM] Cam#5887
members


[09-May-20 11:08 PM] Cam#5887
ohhhhh imma be pisssssssssssssssed


[09-May-20 11:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that isn’t totally major. Doesn’t really impact the group was a whole.


[09-May-20 11:09 PM] bman#0435
ik but its just their communication overall is TERRIBLE

[09-May-20 11:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
We want to reconsider an alliance due to the owner not development announcing application results..? Little bit of an exaggeration...


[09-May-20 11:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean Minn


[09-May-20 11:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
if you don't like SB, fine, but finding the smallest error in whatever you see within the group is just petty..


[09-May-20 11:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They revealed they're looking for new people to design beforehand and swooped out of nowhere by saying the old designer came back


[09-May-20 11:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I personally wouldn't unally because of that but yeah


[09-May-20 11:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
ik but thats his choice


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm a little concerned that he did not provide an update though


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
would we be looking at this the same way if bman was accepted while others weren't


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What exactly is the purpose of opening it up then saying


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Sorry, the old designer is back"


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Again his decision


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think that's very good communication, just putting it out there


[09-May-20 11:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
We need to stop finding flaws within the smallest of things


[09-May-20 11:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ehhh


[09-May-20 11:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I do see why Bman announced it but


[09-May-20 11:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This ain't really that small


[09-May-20 11:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@PackItUpMack I AGREE THAT SHOULD BE HR UNIFORM


[09-May-20 11:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This is really good @RAMMGaming


[09-May-20 11:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Wut


[09-May-20 11:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
We need to involve ourselves in the stuff which concerns us as a group, involving ourselves in unnecessary stuff like that is when the problems start

lets just stop looking for flaws in the smallest of things and appreciate our allies a little more.


[09-May-20 11:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
im sure i could go to Tsunami Sushi and point out numerous flaws except we only ever seem to focus on sizzleburger


[09-May-20 11:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay but I don't like how they wasted Bman's time with the way they handled it


[09-May-20 11:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well Minn


[09-May-20 11:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
not our problem


[09-May-20 11:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Our previous issues with them do concern the group


[09-May-20 11:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hell, the devs don't really have any business of doing what they did in the first place and it's not really helping us one bit


[09-May-20 11:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
RAMM and I did point out our issues already, so I'm not exactly going to repeat myself


[09-May-20 11:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 09:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
What's with Saab's attitude


[10-May-20 09:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
we need 2 announce


[10-May-20 09:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i agree with them saying reporting will be harder


[10-May-20 09:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so i think


[10-May-20 09:44 AM] Cooqkie#2809
until baby and bear put the update out for breaks we should require staff to say


[10-May-20 09:45 AM] Cooqkie#2809
"on break" and "off break" when it ends and starts


[10-May-20 09:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Since when was no grammar included


[10-May-20 09:45 AM] Cooqkie#2809
baby and bear said it was?


[10-May-20 09:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[10-May-20 09:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm fine with breaks but


[10-May-20 09:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I agree with the no grammar part


[10-May-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[10-May-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[10-May-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
until the break update comes out


[10-May-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
we need 2 think of a way to manage reports regarding grammar and being off-task


[10-May-20 09:48 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@xAfroTrey MR announcement and full disc?


[10-May-20 09:49 AM] katie#0200
that should definitely be announced


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] katie#0200
but idk if the whole button thing has been implemented yet


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] katie#0200
so maybe we should wait for more info from bear


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
no there isnt


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i joined my priv server to check


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but we need that update soon


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
treeeeeeeeey


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Since when was grammar not included


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
yesterday i think


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] katie#0200
bear said


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
bear was thinking of ways to handle grammar and reports


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
We're going to talk to Bear about that


[10-May-20 09:50 AM] Cooqkie#2809
he said no grammar for breaks


[10-May-20 09:51 AM] Cooqkie#2809
BUT


[10-May-20 09:51 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i do think


[10-May-20 09:51 AM] Cooqkie#2809
grammar should be required until they put out the update


[10-May-20 09:51 AM] katie#0200
same


[10-May-20 09:51 AM] Cooqkie#2809
tbh i think no breaks at all until that update comes out


[10-May-20 09:52 AM] katie#0200
i think we should keep it how it is until the update so we avoid like a period of confusion between now and the update


[10-May-20 09:52 AM] katie#0200
ye


[10-May-20 09:52 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[10-May-20 09:52 AM] Cooqkie#2809
we needa ask baby and bear tho


[10-May-20 09:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal bearrrrrr


[10-May-20 09:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
A lot of them don't like this at all


[10-May-20 09:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
we think there shouldnt be breaks until u put the new update with the break button


[10-May-20 09:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
also


[10-May-20 09:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
the MRs like


[10-May-20 09:53 AM] Cooqkie#2809
HAAAAAAAATEEEEEEEEEEE it

[10-May-20 09:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809

but


[10-May-20 09:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-May-20 09:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Looks like we have to talk to the owners about this


[10-May-20 09:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think theyre still sleeping


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] bman#0435
saab is so annoying omfg


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 09:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 09:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NICE


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
we need to add a "break" nax


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
max*


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so like


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
only 4 staff at a time can be on break


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
with a time limit


[10-May-20 09:56 AM] Cooqkie#2809
and a cooldown


[10-May-20 09:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@xAfroTrey @bman @katie do u think its a good idea to put up a vote just to see how many mrs like and dont like the breaks


[10-May-20 09:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep


[10-May-20 09:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[10-May-20 09:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-May-20 09:59 AM] bman#0435
ok well bear wants staff to have breaks


[10-May-20 09:59 AM] bman#0435

[10-May-20 09:59 AM] bman#0435
their vote doesnt exactly matter


[10-May-20 10:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but


[10-May-20 10:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809

@Beartikal so apparently the mrs hate the idea of breaks and saab is being so hard to handle and explain it to and is being stubborn so can u explain to them the whole break stuff and how u plan for it to work out because clearly me and trey arent doing enough

[10-May-20 10:08 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so far


[10-May-20 10:08 AM] Cooqkie#2809
the majority of votes is they dont like it


[10-May-20 10:09 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's clear they really don't like this


[10-May-20 10:09 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[10-May-20 10:10 AM] bman#0435

o


[10-May-20 10:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I do see what they mean of how it's going to be chaotic and messy


[10-May-20 10:11 AM] bman#0435
they literally are being so ignorant and at this point are picking small arguments


[10-May-20 10:11 AM] bman#0435
well we werent the ones to decide this, bear was


[10-May-20 10:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 10:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

Holy shit I like moody's idea


[10-May-20 10:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
What’s Moody’s idea I didn’t see it


[10-May-20 10:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"if ur going to add staff breaks, you really need to add scripts to it. maybe if a guest approaches to a station the staff get notified that theres a guest in need. and also the time limits idea to breaks is necessary, along with adding "on-break" next to their name, u could also add the "on-break" next to their name in the chatbox so reports dont get abused and falsely reported."


[10-May-20 10:14 AM] bman#0435
staff get notified when someone gets to their station


[10-May-20 10:14 AM] bman#0435
but then lrs might fight over who helps them


[10-May-20 10:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not mad of the idea of a time limit


[10-May-20 10:15 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya there needs to be a time limit


[10-May-20 10:15 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
As it perfectly balances exploring and actually working


[10-May-20 10:16 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
5 minutes sounds like enough time


[10-May-20 10:16 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya


[10-May-20 10:16 AM] Cooqkie#2809
With a cool down


[10-May-20 10:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
How long is it going to be used for


[10-May-20 10:17 AM] Cooqkie#2809
The cool down?


[10-May-20 10:18 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Or the time limit


[10-May-20 10:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cool down


[10-May-20 10:18 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I think


[10-May-20 10:18 AM] Cooqkie#2809
20-30 mins


[10-May-20 10:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
So the cooldown should be every 20-30 minutes


[10-May-20 10:20 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya


[10-May-20 10:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
This is really good too


[10-May-20 10:20 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"u could have a !break command where it puts an on-break tag above the LR's name with a timer for like 8 minutes, then when the timer is done both the MR who used the command and the LR are notified"


[10-May-20 10:20 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Maybe we should make a google form for ideas to make them easier to keep track of?


[10-May-20 10:21 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah, Idm that


[10-May-20 10:21 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Wut


[10-May-20 10:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't mind


[10-May-20 10:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ooo


[10-May-20 10:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[10-May-20 10:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
U make it or I make it


[10-May-20 10:23 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Their concept is really good cookie


[10-May-20 10:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

(hate breaks love uniform)


[10-May-20 10:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
They just hate the rule of its current state


[10-May-20 10:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I find it odd tho


[10-May-20 10:26 AM] bman#0435
we hate a lot of things but we dont lash out about it and complain about having to update our guides


[10-May-20 10:26 AM] bman#0435
🙄🙄


[10-May-20 10:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The time limit idea is genius ngl


[10-May-20 10:27 AM] bman#0435
bear was already planning on a time limit lol


[10-May-20 10:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think we should change back (if everyone's okay with it) until the update comes out

[10-May-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
^


[10-May-20 02:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
no just y'all didnt like her


[10-May-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
hence y she wasnt nominated last time


[10-May-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435
lol


[10-May-20 02:10 PM] emma;#1525
no literally no ones stuck up for her in months


[10-May-20 02:10 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[10-May-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525
sorry but I don’t like when people are in cliques and never talk to anyone else like Anna does (she barely talks in our discord server)


[10-May-20 02:12 PM] emma;#1525
if she wins we have to seriously purge this server


[10-May-20 02:12 PM] emma;#1525
Bc almost everyone has trashed her


[10-May-20 02:12 PM] emma;#1525
Including some of her “voters”


[10-May-20 02:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
wait


[10-May-20 02:13 PM] bman#0435
literally everyone was saying candy yesterday and no one mentioned anna which is kinda funny


[10-May-20 02:13 PM] bman#0435
^


[10-May-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
Y’all are voting Anna when she legit only has activity going for her and no other qualities


[10-May-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ ya she is lol


[10-May-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
Emily and Anna both are


[10-May-20 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
it doesnt matter if someone is friends with someone whos banned


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
i literally had to warn her passing too many cbs because she was too careless


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
banned and active CBS are pretty different


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
Y’all not wanting madi Bc she was wanted recently to the last shift vote is funny now that Anna’s being voting but wasn’t she just warned


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
Like a few weeks ago


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She got suspended


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ are you voting


[10-May-20 02:14 PM] emma;#1525
Anna was suspended??


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] emma;#1525
Wow I missed that


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
I’m voting candy-


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
WHEN


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
wa she


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
Suspended


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Madi did


[10-May-20 02:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
Oh


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm going for Candy since she's the best candidate out of everyone here


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont get how being talkative or not shows if theyre ready for shift or not


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
it’s not being talkative so much as being a leader and willing to help others


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] emma;#1525
Versus only having self interest


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
huh


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She has the same things I liked about Stacey when I voted for her


[10-May-20 02:16 PM] bman#0435
cookie keep in mind that anna was careless to not follow the rules and was given verbal warnings and then a written warning


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
Meanwhile candy hasn’t been warned


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
🤷🏼‍♀️


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Gets along with everyone well, activity is consistent, no maturity problems/issues, etc


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] bman#0435
and she didnt even respond to, possibly ignored, my warning to her


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
bman u had warnnigs u still got promoted


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-May-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're dumb tho lol


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
we want anna, you want candy, let's see who wins


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] bman#0435
I GOT WARNED FOR IMMATURITY WITH NO PROOF


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] a. ღ#4222

[10-May-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He got warned for complimenting a hat lol


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] bman#0435
I GOT WARNED FOR DOXXING BUT I WAS TOLD TO APPEAL IT?


[10-May-20 02:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-May-20 02:17 PM] bman#0435
I GOT WARNED FOR CLMPLIMENTING SOMEONE


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey what qualities did I have to make you vote for me


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
ya what was Anna warned for


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you want someone who's been recently warned, shows 0 qualities of a shift other than "activity", and literally everyone here has been against until today for some reason lol excuse me for being mega confused


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] bman#0435
so which ome exactly was considered for my promotion? considering none if my warnings are valid


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
if anna wins we need at least a week to clean up this server


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
bc theres been so much hate on them both until


[10-May-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
TODAY


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
^


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I voted for you since you had pretty good activity, no issues that I know of, etc @stacey


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] bman#0435
cant compare my warnings to anna when i have 3 INVALID warnings


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait what was anna warned for


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
ya idk cookie


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
I forget


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
she literally passes CBs bc she never takes the chance to check


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
bman had to warn her for it


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
I mean Anna and Emily have both have had decent activity but has their issues in the past


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
like she wasnt noting down low account ages


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think Anna's going to win


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I just think Candy is the better candidate


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
was that her only warning


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
Everyone here? Anna is currently **leading** with **7** votes. She's been working with continuous daily activity for more than one year which is some solid dedication to the group. She's mature and polite and has worked hard enough for this promotion. I don't know what y'all have against her, but it's certainly personal as there is no solid groups to keep holding her from a promotion.


[10-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
ACTIVITY ISN'T THE ONLY QUALITY


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
never said it was


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
and how tf do we know about her maturity when she only talks in the discord like


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
3 sentences


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
a day


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
every other day


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
how does that affect anything


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Oh so you have to talk in the Discord now to be promoted?


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
News to me.


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
i wanna know y u guys r voting anna over candy


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
yeah sorry i like well rounded people who actually try to be leaders


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if we had a discord when i was an MR you would barely see me in the chatting channels


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
instead of only interested in hosting


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
So like do you never see Anna getting shift then? I honestly believe she deserves it


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
except for “activity”


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Because Anna deserves it.


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey Not really in this state


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
and candy doesnt...?


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
I mean again she literally doesn't show any leadership qualities


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Not saying Candy doesn't, I'm saying Anna deserves it more.


[10-May-20 02:20 PM] a. ღ#4222
When was candy promoted


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
If she can start being more active then maybe


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not really


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
LIke in the discord


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
And helping out other people


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Candy is promoted August, Anna is promoted April.


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
More experience.


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
That's literally only 4 months lmao


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] stacey#1000
I wasn’t extremely active in the discord when I was promoted


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not far off at all


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
Minn you got promoted before me and I had a year on you


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
So that's not valid


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
Sorry


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
😂


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
That wasn't my decision :shrug:


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah but this is our decision so we shouldn't be saying 4 months has that big of a difference


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
I just don’t understand how y’all can talk bad about her then the next day vote for her


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
Can we also remember how Candy was inactive for literally 50% of her senior journey?


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
When we all know it clearly doesn't


[10-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
Tf lol


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] bman#0435
i was too and i got shift lol


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wanted Minn since all of the other candidates kind of sucked except for Emma and Polk lol


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] bman#0435
i went to camp for 2 months


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] bman#0435
but here i am


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
Anna and Emily literally are BFFs with CBs which most of y'all said was a dealbreaker for you


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
That hasn't changed


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i thought u went for 3 months


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
Kiki was inactive for FIVE MONTHS came back for three months and got senior


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
So why are you suddenly voting for her


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
2 months inactivity compared to 4-5 months inactivity is a huge difference


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
I haven’t really sad anything negative about her recently


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] bman#0435
2 months


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] bman#0435
6 weeks in total


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
Which CBs, might I ask? And may I see this proof?


[10-May-20 02:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Harriett, Xao, and I think someone else in the mix


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
I’m voting for her because 1. BST needs help and 2. She’s active and I’ve seen no issues with her recently.


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
I mean Harriet talked to me about it plenty


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
We don't vote BASED ON TIMEZONES that is rigged


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
harriet doesnt come anymore?


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Does BST really need help exactly


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
But we vote based on gender?


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cool.


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not voting candy bc she's a girl


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn that was a joke lol


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
I like that she's a girl lmao


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
But I voted for CAM last round


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
and candy was up then too


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
and I still liked her then


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
I’m just stating why I’m voting her. She’s also been here a lot longer then candy.


[10-May-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
But I do agree candy is a good candidate too.


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
Again I was here before most of the HRs promoted before me so I don't take that as a valid reason


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm skeptical of Anna hanging out with CBs but


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] stacey#1000
So what kind of leadership qualities does candy show over Anna


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
Like if candy deserves it she deserves it and her having 4 "less months" experience during a 2 year long career is really not a factor that decides anything


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
I mean candy actually like interacts with the MRs


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't hate the girl lol


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well my vote stays with Anna


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
how does that affect her


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
Y'all pick who you want to pick


[10-May-20 02:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
interaction with other mrs is kinda of being picky


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] bman#0435
@Cooqkie dms


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
But I think anna deserves it, and therefore I'm sticking with her


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] bman#0435
importante


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
I mean even today Candy was talking about the break thing and trying to help other MRs understand it


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i bet theres several of us like me who barely interacted with other mrs when we were mrs


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie again its about LEADERSHIP idk why no one understands that lol


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's leadership right there


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so i dont think its fair to judge based on that


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
Okay cookie and maybe that would have affected you today


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Kind of hard to argue with that


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
but 3 years ago we didnt have discord


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
so that wasn't even a posibility to judge on


[10-May-20 02:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
🤷‍♀️


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
My vote is staying as Candy


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] emma;#1525
yeah its kinda funny that y'all are ANNA ANNA ANNA but emily does like the same amount of stuff lol


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
kinda why i wanted 2 new shifts


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They feel more or less the same


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah i wanted anna and emily


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
well we can’t have both


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] emma;#1525
So are y'all gonna automatically vote emily next round bc lets just fucking hire them both then 🙄


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] emma;#1525
get it over with


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
baby said 1 new shift


[10-May-20 02:26 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I could very well still change my vote


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
and if we **need** a new one in a month or so we'll hire


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
We don't need one now lmao


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
uh yes we do


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
No we don't


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes we do


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
Our hosting schedule is like


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
Filled to the brim usually


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
especially a bst hr


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
no


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
it is not


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
bst is abandoned


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
I can barely find a time to host


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
UHM


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
BST early hours are empty


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
est? flying high with activity


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
We have 3 BST HRs


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
bst? nope


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
3 busy BST hrs


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] stacey#1000
We do. The past 2 days I’ve had to bug the seniors to help with apps and then hosting banning sessions


[10-May-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
We have busy american HRs too lmao


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm a little worried that timezones are a factor but whatever


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
but we have a lot of american hrs


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] emma;#1525
Bonnie you're BST the same way that Bloo is "EST"


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
so some are busy


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Legit yesterday morning there was over 700 apps


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] Cam#5887
if you're asking for people to host early, i can host at like 3 AM CST


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
some are not


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
time zones shouldn’t be a reason


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
i know im bst


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's not because of time zones lmao


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
Stacey baby just needs to close the app center and open on weekends


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] emma;#1525
It's really not fair to hire based on time zones tho bc that doesn't mean they earned it more


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
It’s too much


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Timezones can only go so far if they lack other aspects


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
Time zones are for sure a positive, but that is not why she's  being voted


[10-May-20 02:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
not the main point


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Candy to me feels more complete and all around what I'm looking for


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
Fine I’ll remove my vote for now and decide later


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
Bonnie can’t we do the app center only on Saturday’s again? It’s too much to handle


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
Just like candy being a better senior is a *minor point* we want her


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
thing is story


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
oh wait jk thats a major point


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
LOL


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
its so much hard work to get it open and closd


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
how is it hard work, its called you open and close the game


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
There I removed my vote for now


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
it takes 2 seconds


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont open and close it


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
we gotta contact baby or bear


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
butleaving it open all the time is TERRIBLE


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
yeah it's not hard tho


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
But Anna still winning either way with leading vote


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
hope they are online


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
not if people realize that candy literally is so much more involved in a well rounded way than anna is


[10-May-20 02:29 PM] emma;#1525
yes anna is active


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] emma;#1525
yes she hosts


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
Anna is active I GIVER HER that


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] emma;#1525
but candy is actually well rounded


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] emma;#1525
she helps out others, she answers questions, she partakes in discussions about our group


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
See like


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Anna is homeschooled


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
I was active for a full year then look what happened when I got hr 😖😖


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] katie#0200
if you guys were talking about anna not talking in the discord enough look at candy's mesages in staff lounge and general discussion she sends like one message a day


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And while that's great and all


[10-May-20 02:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
So anna being homeschooled is going to effect her promotion? That's crap


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think that penalizes everyone else


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm homeschooled, never affected my promotions


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] a. ღ#4222
can’t u let trey finish talking


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] a. ღ#4222
Lmao


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] emma;#1525
@katie I did look at candy's messages lol and she defo talks more than anna does when you look at overall activity


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Exactly


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't really finish talking lol


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] emma;#1525
Everyone who's homeschooled had way more activity than non-homeschooled people and that's just a fact


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
never knew we judged on discord activity


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not tryna use that in a "good/bad" way


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
I just don’t know when we started looking at activity in the discord to get promoted.


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[10-May-20 02:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
neither did I 💀


[10-May-20 02:32 PM] emma;#1525
can y'all honestly listen to my point for 3 seconds bc I feel like you guys are only hearing "omg candy talks more" and not my reasoning as to how that actually being viewed


[10-May-20 02:32 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn yeah well most of the people who voted for her sent bad messages on her


[10-May-20 02:32 PM] emma;#1525
So that's not just us rn


[10-May-20 02:32 PM] katie#0200
i dont rlly see why we're looking down on them having a bit more time than others, she's using her time to help out at the group so 🤷‍♀️


[10-May-20 02:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but I think she's very one dimensional imo


[10-May-20 02:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No knock on Anna, I'm glad she's active


[10-May-20 02:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
^


[10-May-20 02:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
they've been working for so long, surely they're wondering why they aren't being promoted


[10-May-20 02:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well see minn


[10-May-20 02:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
especially if people who got senior AFTER them are being promoted


[10-May-20 02:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's kind of more of a them problem then ours really


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
i mean


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
for sure it's a them problem, but its a problem we have a solution too


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
at the end of the day guys  we're gonna have different opinions


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
so this is gonna be an intense and close vote


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
^


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435
no if anything itd drag them more in since they have more and new things to do


[10-May-20 02:34 PM] emma;#1525
if they're gonna lose interest bc they aren't being promoted i dont want them anyways


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Candy just fits better to me


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
u dont want them anyway so


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
because i can only remember seeing her once


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] a. ღ#4222
But why not emily is the question


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] emma;#1525
No I don't and you literally just said they're gonna "lose interest" anyways and being promoted shouldn't change that


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[10-May-20 02:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I lost interest plenty of times but did that technically stop me


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not really cause there's ways to gain it back


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
I was a senior for 16 months but I stuck through it anyways


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
welp ive gotta finish doing something for stapleton, ive made my final decision though


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
Exactly minn


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's no difference with them


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] a. ღ#4222
they are the same person bahaha


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're both really nice people don't get me wrong


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] a. ღ#4222
extremely nice


[10-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You guys kind of mentioned it but ok


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
im surprised u didnt vote fraux tbh


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause Fraux just came back


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
Fraux just came back, I love fraux but he’s been gone forever


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
but u guys been talking like u were gonna


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
but im glad u didnt


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He had the same problem as Kiki at one point


[10-May-20 02:37 PM] emma;#1525
I didn't vote fraux bc i knew he had 0 chance lol and I have other seniors I like too im not only bwanting fraux


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] emma;#1525
do i think fraux is ready, yes, but i know a losing battle when i see one


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fraux needs more consistency


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
I like fraux he would be good but not this vote


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Too soon


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe like July/August and I'll consier


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
consider


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] emma;#1525
well it sounds like emily is winning the next vote


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's basically what Fash suffered at one point


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] emma;#1525
and then MAYBE candy


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] emma;#1525
so fraux has 0 chance


[10-May-20 02:38 PM] emma;#1525
for at least 6 months


[10-May-20 02:39 PM] emma;#1525
bc y'all already decided how this is playing out lol


[10-May-20 02:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
we'll see


[10-May-20 02:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
u never know


[10-May-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
I never said I would vote Emily next


[10-May-20 02:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think Emi and Anna have much identity tbh


[10-May-20 02:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oops not candy


[10-May-20 02:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Anna*


[10-May-20 02:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Despite our opinions, I think most people would be very happy to see them besides us


[10-May-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Everyone listed are fine choices


[10-May-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not now at the very least


[10-May-20 02:41 PM] stacey#1000
Which is good this is not 2 shifts getting hired


[10-May-20 02:42 PM] bman#0435
anna is so careless about her decisions


[10-May-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
I mean no one is perfect?


[10-May-20 02:42 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 02:42 PM] xM_inn#2821

[10-May-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
Sure she made mistakes as a senior but now I don’t see any issue tbh


[10-May-20 02:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
My thing with Anna is


[10-May-20 02:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think her issues are easily fixable


[10-May-20 02:43 PM] bman#0435
i never said she was perfect, but she doesnt learn from her own mistakes or decisions


[10-May-20 02:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But she's just not at that point yet


[10-May-20 02:43 PM] a. ღ#4222
When was cam promoted to senior


[10-May-20 02:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Cam


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Whereas Candy just feels more refined and knows what she's doing


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
@Cam


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887

[10-May-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887
o


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887

[10-May-20 02:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
when were u promoted


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
lol


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
And when was


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
Anna


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] Cam#5887
then i was promoted to shift on 3/28/2020


[10-May-20 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
mhm


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
why didn’t u promote Anna last time then


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] Cam#5887
is it bad that i passed her up tho?


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
NO CAM


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
not at all


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
I’m just wondering


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] Cam#5887
o


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
Since they said


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
Experience matters


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
well i didnt really vote on her because i knew u guys all disliked her and she wouldnt have a chance


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] a. ღ#4222
and she’s had a year


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
but i decided to stand up this time and vote


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sit down bonnie


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
**sits**


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sir


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ur fired

Ma'am


[10-May-20 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] a. ღ#4222
so everyone decides to stand up this time


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] a. ღ#4222
?


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
ig


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's probably a chance that Anna just doesn't care about the messages


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
After all


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll just say I see both sides of why you want Anna or why you want candy. I think both a good candidates


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
Are*


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Y'all said a lot of shit about me


[10-May-20 02:46 PM] a. ღ#4222
same Stacey I personally want candy more but


[10-May-20 02:47 PM] a. ღ#4222
Anna is active


[10-May-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is it really necessary to delete though


[10-May-20 02:47 PM] katie#0200
you guys are forgetting the best shift candidate of all


[10-May-20 02:47 PM] katie#0200
imag


[10-May-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No cap


[10-May-20 02:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
😤


[10-May-20 02:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
how many warnings does anna have?


[10-May-20 02:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
has she even had a warning


[10-May-20 02:48 PM] emma;#1525
Yes


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
Bman gave her one recently


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
u have to rly consider timezones tho. just because u dont see candy doesnt mean shes not active


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
she has a higher activity count than anna


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
not by much. but its higher


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well uh


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Anna is BST


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
wait that's hilarious


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] katie#0200
i dont think we should forget about their previous checklists


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not a whole lot you can do about that


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
candy has more on her checklist


[10-May-20 02:49 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt even realize that lmao


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
katie that was from 2019


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
@katie considering anna had a 4 month head start (a year ago so it doesnt really affect anything imo) ofc she's gonna have more


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
5 months old


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] katie#0200
yea they were still seniors tho


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
this checklist was after they both were hired


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
so it's honestly more reflective of overall activity


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
but candy was promoted after them so it wouldnt be fair to consider


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] emma;#1525
but anna having 4 months to be super active before candy is of course going to make her previous checklist look "better"


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
but if we took their old checklists into account, they tried to do everything for everybody


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] a. ღ#4222
Bruh candy has more


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok well


[10-May-20 02:50 PM] katie#0200
why is that bad bman


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
we literally had to tell them to stop doing applications since they were being selfish and wouldnt leave any for anyone else


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
because they didnt care what the other seniors had to do?


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] katie#0200
when was that


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
so more trainings to attend


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
they just wanted to do their stuff and extra without considering what other seniors needed to do


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
candy is cst, actually


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
same thign


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
no


[10-May-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
you can't complain about having no BST sessions when we have 3 BST HRs


[10-May-20 02:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
stapleton is dead early bst


[10-May-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 02:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mine to be exact


[10-May-20 02:52 PM] emma;#1525
its funny how timezones become a huge thing with shift promos but we literally dont care at all with senior promos


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
even tho it's like


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
the same thing


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
is needed!


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
be healthy


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] emma;#1525
8 hours isnt needed if you aren't being active


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i like to get 12


[10-May-20 02:53 PM] katie#0200

[10-May-20 03:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think it's stopping Anna from winning but idm


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] emma;#1525
I don't think we should assume a vote will turn out a certain way an hour into voting


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] emma;#1525
There's still plenty of time for people on both sides to change their mind


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] emma;#1525
But we need to all be transparent about our votes for people to make the most informed choice


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] katie#0200
omg why did i hear your message in tts @xAfroTrey


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] Polk#1596
I have been reading these messages, and just one thing I would like to point out is that Anna is NOT homeschooled. She has a completely ordinary life with school, friends, sports, and so on. She is being active while having other things to do, so don't assume she is homeschooled just because she is active. You can't really assume things about a person when you barely even know anything about her as a person, only as a co-worker. I have known her for a while now, and I can confirm that she is very talkative and has a great personality.


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have no problem discussing why


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's not in homeschool anymore??


[10-May-20 03:09 PM] Polk#1596
Other points are just fine. Just not stuff about her.


[10-May-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Huh


[10-May-20 03:10 PM] Polk#1596
She has never been homeschooled at all


[10-May-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe I confused her for Emily


[10-May-20 03:10 PM] emma;#1525
Interesting but I mean that doesn't really affect much bc candy isn't homeschooled either


[10-May-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know one of them are homeschooled since they've addressed it before


[10-May-20 03:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Candy is in volleyball and so is Lemon


[10-May-20 03:11 PM] emma;#1525
It's just funny that the main "pro anna" argument is activity but candy's card has more comments and even on the old cards they were pretty similar (when you account the promo time diference)


[10-May-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
someone that voted anna said she was homeschooled but idk who


[10-May-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
so yikes


[10-May-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[10-May-20 03:11 PM] emma;#1525
Like don't pretend anna is super active and candy isn't, they're both active but that doesn't make it right to say anna deserves it because she's MORE active when she's clearly not


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
are the hr votes always like this


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] Polk#1596
Just to put this out here, she would've been more active if she wasn't warned for being too active. From what I understand, she was warned for hogging applications and was even told to host less sessions.


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
well bman


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no beanman lol


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] emma;#1525
No they're usually straightforward


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
they werent


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
but probably now yes


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk I don't think we ever told her to host less sessions


[10-May-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
o ok because the only one ive done is cam which everyone agreed on lol


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] emma;#1525
She was told to stop hogging applications but that's becuase it's a requirement for everyone to do and it was preventing others from completing their checklists


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] emma;#1525
She was never told to stop doing applications


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] bman#0435
why would she be warned to host less sessions...?


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] Polk#1596
Trey did.


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] emma;#1525
Just to make sure she completed her requirements and let others have a chance BEFORE she started doing hundreds at a time again


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uh no


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] bman#0435
i remember when i was denied from hosting because i hosted too much in a day lol


[10-May-20 03:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not why I warned her


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was a part of that but that's not all


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
Also the "hogging" warning was agreed by most of the HRs


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
So i dont see how that's a point to be used in her favor... when everyone agreed on it... lol


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She also had an issue with reading them properly


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the warning for that was for all seniors lol


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
She was passing ones that should have faired


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
failed


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
i remember that discussion lol


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
baby told me hogging shouldnt even exist, its just called being more active than someone else


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 then it shouldn't be a requirement


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] Polk#1596
Trey, I am positive that she asked you if she would have to host less sessions as she asked me about it, and I directed her to you.


[10-May-20 03:14 PM] emma;#1525
We can't expect all the seniors to do the requirement if you WANT 1-2 to hog constantly


[10-May-20 03:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I wanted to her to cool down but that's not the whole reason why


[10-May-20 03:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
My main issue was her method of applications


[10-May-20 03:15 PM] emma;#1525
If y'all don't care about hogging we either need to be more forgiving when seniors DONT meet requirements OR we need to just... not have requirements...


[10-May-20 03:15 PM] emma;#1525
bc we can't put a lot of importance on something if you're fine with one or two seniors preventing the others from doing it in the first place


[10-May-20 03:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She was passing applications with three grammar mistakes, copied answers, etc


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] emma;#1525
and that's not specifically on anna that's just a general thing


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And there was like 10 of those daily


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] emma;#1525
bc it seems like y'all will come up with any random argument to defend anna when we all know her being BST is a large reason for wanting to hire her


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Once it was brought to my attention, I talked to her about it


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
wrong lol


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But it still started happening and so I warned her


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
bst is a minor reason to add to the argument


[10-May-20 03:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
no where near a main reason


[10-May-20 03:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why is it even a reason to begin with lol


[10-May-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
considering stacey hosts more BST friendly sessions than anyone i think that's proof a timezone doesn't mean much


[10-May-20 03:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cam is doing that too


[10-May-20 03:17 PM] Polk#1596
Well, I'm just saying. She was way more active before for AGES, then she was told to host less. That is why she is less active now, because she is only trying to follow Trey's orders.


[10-May-20 03:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah and I have no issue with that


[10-May-20 03:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm glad she's taking my advice


[10-May-20 03:18 PM] Polk#1596
So, in my opinion, Anna has and is more active than Candy in total.


[10-May-20 03:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but my problem is


[10-May-20 03:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
anna is supppperrrrrrrrrrr active


[10-May-20 03:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's one dimensional compared to others


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] emma;#1525
The fact that Anna and Candy have the same activity disproves that polk lmao


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bman#0435
candy has more activity commetns than anna though...?


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
but if we are promoting on activity then why did we wait so long for alloe to get promoted


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] emma;#1525
Anna is still super active and literally EVERYONE was okay with asking her to be more respectful of applications


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
because we thought alloe was a cb


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
well i didnt


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] emma;#1525
You can't suddenly decide that was wrong of us when y'all agreed to it


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
but someone did


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We have a suspicion she was a CB


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bman#0435
i did


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bman#0435
.


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bman#0435
.


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bman#0435
.


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
does it even matter if they talk to CBs


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] emma;#1525
I mean anna's been more active than cam but y'all hired cam


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes it does lol


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] emma;#1525
just saying


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
talking to someone shouldnt make them unable to be promoted


[10-May-20 03:19 PM] emma;#1525
this argument feels real biased when you've never used these reasons to hire anna over anyone else before


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] a. ღ#4222
no hate cam


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It could lead to leaking and some trash talking we don't know


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] emma;#1525
xoxo cam you did deserve it i voted u


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
Emma, I just said this. Anna used to be WAY more active, one of the MOST active Seniors, then she was told to start hosting less, etc, so she was just following Trey's orders. She was active for ages, way more active than Candy. Right now, they have the same amount of activity, yes. But that is only because Anna is trying to follow Trey's orders.


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No proof but it's a possibity


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk She's still WAY active


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] emma;#1525
I don't see why you think she's had a severe drop in activity


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] emma;#1525
when she legit is the third most active senior


[10-May-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435
i dont think that is a fair argument considering candy was promoted months after anna


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
the reason i havent voted her before is ive seen how you guys were saying a few months ago "oh she talks to cbs" so i presumed she had no chance then so no point voting, but now theres no issue so im voting for her


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
why didnt u talk about it


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] emma;#1525
No one is saying that anna is inactive except for you lmao we all realize anna has a lot of activity, the point is that candy has a similar amount. Anna being asked to do less apps also (again as I said numerous times) was something we all agreed on so you can't backtrack that and she literally hosts a ton so I'm not sure trey's "orders" were that effective


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] Polk#1596
> The fact that Anna and Candy have the same activity disproves that polk lmao
@emma;


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] Polk#1596
This is what I was referring to when I said it ^


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
because i hate having discussions in this chat


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Welp now's ur chance to resign


[10-May-20 03:21 PM] bman#0435
but discussions are good...?


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@a. ღ you hear that buddy


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
what


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Now's ur time to be promoted


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
To BOD


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk I just don't see how you can look at anna's card, see she hosts 4+ sessions a day, and still think she feels like she can't host a lot


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
not when i always get stressed over them


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
I CANT WAIT!!


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] emma;#1525
Like she is hosting a lot


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but I kind of think that's ignorant bonnie


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] emma;#1525
I dont' get how you even can THINK she feels like she's not allowed to


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's basically like baby saying bans are too negative


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
you are entitled to ur own opinion trey


[10-May-20 03:22 PM] Polk#1596
That's not even what I am saying


[10-May-20 03:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He did but


[10-May-20 03:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nobody really liked that point lol


[10-May-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
You said they both have the same amount of activity, so I just said Anna has a history of being way more active, and was told to be less active so she is as active as she is now.


[10-May-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
Anna doesn't have a history of being way more active, her card had more comments because yes she was promoted first lmao


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but I find Candy more impressive given her schedule


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
I mean if you want to literally write down a percent of activity okay sure maybe anna was a bit more active but they have always been pretty comparable


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The point is


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
And she wasn't told to be less active WE ASKED HER to be more mindful of letting people do applications and get their checklists done


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're both neck and neck with activity


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
If I am not mistaken, she was still way more active daily. I am not looking at the amount of comments, I am looking at the daily amount of activity in the past before she was told to cool off a little bit.


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
If she interpreted it as being less active that's not our fault


[10-May-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
Comments is the same as daily activity...? literally how we track activity


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Only cause I told her to chill out a bit lol


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] bman#0435
also y is no one leaving comments on their cards like emma asked lol


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Do I think she should be penalized for it


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
You said she had more comments because she was promoted first, so I said she was still more active than Candy daily when they were both Seniors.


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] bman#0435
besides me bonnie and emma


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No of course not


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
You keep missing my point


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk Has anna talked to you about feeling like she can't be as active as she wants


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean with Candy


[10-May-20 03:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
bonnie whens the last time u hosted @bonnie591


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
last week


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I didn't have to ask her that


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
i didnt host this week


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
No, but as I said, she asked me the question, then I directed her to Trey and he told her to cool off.


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
I could say anna never hosts for me lol


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
just been too busy


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
do u even host consistently


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
ya same she never hosts for me


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
lol


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
As Trey gave her the warning back then.


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk But you don't actually know that she feels like she can't be as active as she wants


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
im consistent at hosting once a week


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's BST


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
Never said I did?


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg u cant say candy never asks u to host if u host once a week...


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
Polk do you have a clear argument bc it keeps changing


[10-May-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
I pointed out something, then you keep missing my point, so I have to explain and explain


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 ur BST and she's not!!! THat clearly means she can never be active in BST since we need a new BST to be active since no one else can be active in BST


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] bman#0435
anna ahsnt hosted for me since idk how long since the archived cards dont even come up


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk Your point is that her activity dropped because trey told her not to host as much and yet she's still hosting 2-4 times a day consistently


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
Which is pretty similar to her old levels of activity


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
So I'm just confused as to why you think she hosts less when she's clearly... not hosting less..


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
Emma, listen.


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
like when she goes off for the night and wakes up


[10-May-20 03:27 PM] katie#0200
I think Polk means that Anna would be more active than Candy rn if she wasn't told to chill out a bit


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
But Anna's activity levels are the same as "pre chill out"


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
She was still hosting 2-4 times a day


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 then host more??


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] bman#0435
ya tbh i dont think anna has ever hosted for me considering every time i search her in archives my cards dont come up


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
no


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
**i am too busy**


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
again not anyone's fault that you and minn only do stapleton and dont host lol


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
how do i explain


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
the breaks


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
and dont ask my definition of busy


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
and where


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] bman#0435

[10-May-20 03:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont only do stapleton


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal we're discussing a shift promo just beign honest we're all heated and prob not gonna listen about breaks


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
xoxo tho


[10-May-20 03:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey @bman where do i explain the idea of breaks


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
you said you couldnt handle it this morniung at 10


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
stapleton is only like 3 hours of my 168 hours i have a week


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] emma;#1525
that's 3 hours you could be hosting


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
bonnie im just saying u cant not agree on candy because the last time she asked u to host aws a while ago. ur bst and u host one time a week... its not fair to judge her on that


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal in staff announcements. the mrs were arguing with me and trey about how much they dislike it, so then cookie made a form for them to suggest break ideas


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] emma;#1525
i mean that's 3 sessions


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] emma;#1525
🤷‍♀️


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435
look at sl from like 9 or 10 am est


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont see whats to dislike about not working


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
just because im a bod at bloxton doesnt mean i cant spend 3 hours on other games


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal its the MRs they're always gonna dislike what we do


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435
saab dislikes it because she doesnt want to update her guides :Skull:


[10-May-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
You said "The fact that Anna and Candy have the same activity disproves that polk lmao". My response to this was that Anna used to be way more active than she is now, and I am confident she would've continued doing so if she wasn't told to cool off by Trey. However, she did listen to what Trey said and now she is as active as she is. You then pointed out that Anna had more comments than Candy since Anna was promoted before Candy, and to my response, I said Anna still used to be way more active than Candy on a daily-basis. Not looking at the amount of comments in TOTAL, I am talking about the amount of comments being added daily.


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
sorry but they are gonna hve to get used to change


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They don't really hate the idea of breaks


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] bman#0435
they were arguing because they want staff to be working and not leave guests unattended


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
i choose where i spend my 3 hours and i choose to do it at stapleton. i probably spend 2 hours a week doing bloxton stuff too so its not completely unbalanced.


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] bman#0435
and if lrs get breaks then they want breaks


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
1 hour is done hosting


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] Polk#1596
That is all


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal i think for breaks rn they dislike it bc theres no real organization to it


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
1 hour is doing tickets / applications and other stuff behind the scenes


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk And I'm telling you that her activity as far as SESSIONS (the only thing she's been told to cool off that we didn't all agree on ig) she's still hosting around 3-4 sessions a day which is what she was doing back BEFORE trey told her to chill


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] bman#0435
lemme show u cookies poll...


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think the issue is how they're going to take advantage of it


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] emma;#1525
She wasn't hosting 8-9 times a day


[10-May-20 03:30 PM] emma;#1525
her SESSION activity really has not gone down


[10-May-20 03:31 PM] bman#0435

[10-May-20 03:31 PM] emma;#1525
and that's the only thing that wasn't universally approved to ask her to chill out about


[10-May-20 03:31 PM] emma;#1525
You can't argue that her OTHER activity would be higher if she's never even been talked to about it lol


[10-May-20 03:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
emma do u watch youtube


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
Fair, but sessions do affect activity overall.


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
and if u do


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
how long for a week appox


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
approx


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk By MAYBE 1-2 comments a day


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
maybe


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
emma answer my question


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
Yes, okay.


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
hence why I've been saying they're basically EQUAL so it doesn't make sense to say anna is super active and candy isn't


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] Polk#1596
My point was just that Candy and Anna aren't just as active. That's all


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok ignore me


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 did you delete the old senior lists


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
like not archive, delete


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
for activity


[10-May-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525
and yes i watch youtube


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
idk


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
Candy is active, Anna is a little more active. That is all ma'am


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay I'm sorry but that's mad confusing lol @Polk


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
i cant remember


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
but ive never been active at hosting so i dont judge people based on if they host for me or not bc I'm self aware


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
can u remember


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
if i say "this person never hosts for me either" its meant to be funny bc we all know i dont host


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] a. ღ#4222
anna and candy are both active, but we shouldnt just be looking at activity


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok i dont host


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
so then why are you saying candy never asks you to host as a bad thing


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
if you admit you dont host


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
u host like once a week too


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
no i dont


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] emma;#1525
maybe like once a month LOL


[10-May-20 03:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
the old activity checklists?


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
but emma didnt use that as an EXCUSE


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn yes


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
It's not my fault Emma kept asking me questions about something not really making sense with my current statement at the time over and over again, that's why it went a little confusing.


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
bruh


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
u have hosted


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
pretty sure i just archived them


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
once a week


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
not sure whether it was the cards or the list


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
If you want me to explain it to you Trey, I can.


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
at least for the last 2 weeks


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
defo didnt delete tho


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait what


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk Pretty sure I listened to you and you admitted that if anna was to host more it would only affect her COMMENTS by 1-2 a day


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
It seemed like you agreed with that


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
If you didn't agree you shouldn't have said so lol


[10-May-20 03:34 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn ok well I cant find the old cards


[10-May-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I was really confused on you pointing out this sentence


[10-May-20 03:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
ill loook soon


[10-May-20 03:35 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 03:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and come back later


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
she said she hosted once a month


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ apparently me saying i only host 1 time a month isnt true


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
but she hosted twice this month


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
what a liar


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 but there are months i never host so it evens out


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
why are we even discussing that


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
gotta take the average

[10-May-20 03:37 PM] emma;#1525
basic math


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok so u dont host once a month


[10-May-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's one month stupid lol


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We're talking about everything else


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] Polk#1596
The thing is you kept asking me questions that didn't really make sense with my current statement at the time. I was talking about how you said Candy and Anna have the same amount of activity by talking about Anna's history in activity and how she used to be more active daily (and now this may or may not be true, but I am 50% sure the warning was not exactly a big motivation boost for her activity overall). Then you said her card had way more comments because she was promoted first, which was not even a part of my argument at all. That is all.


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
you sometimes host once a month but also sometimes host two times aa month and sometimes dont host a month


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk My thing about the comments was an addition to your statement...


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
Just me trying to point out more information lol


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
Sue me


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] Polk#1596
Ok so basically, I meant that Anna is still more active than Candy. I didn't really try to make such a big deal out of this. @xAfroTrey


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] emma;#1525
Anyways I agree with Cookie


[10-May-20 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591

Everyone should just put their opinions on the stupid cards and we'll let people make their own stupid decisions and we'll have to purge the chat either way now so gg

they dont deserve to see us arguing like they're two types of cake that we cant pick between


[10-May-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey so you know it sucks


[10-May-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525
and you shouldn't want them to go through it


[10-May-20 03:40 PM] emma;#1525

I got some shit too but I didn't care lol


[10-May-20 03:41 PM] emma;#1525
Anna has potential to be a shift but she's just not well rounded AS OF RIGHT NOW so that's why I made my choice and that's what I put on my COMMENT ON THE CARD WHICH IS WHAT Y'ALL SHOULD BE DOING


[10-May-20 03:41 PM] a. ღ#4222
can we just make a new chat 🥰

I'll do what Claire did in her resignation letter


[10-May-20 03:45 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 would be totally against rules right so we'd never do it


[10-May-20 03:45 PM] emma;#1525

```
Regarding breaks, we're thinking of introducing it via either a timer, or a on-off system when you chat "break"/"off break"
yet it looks like many of you disagree with the idea of breaks, what puts you off about them?
breaks are here to allow staff to play as a guest and to enjoy the hotel as any normal player could do. on this break period, we're thinking of making grammer not a requirement. Professionality must be maintained, however.
please keep in mind that when an LR decides to finish working, they LEAVE the game, breaks makes it so that they don't have to leave in fear of being punished. Being present at the hotel doesn't mean they want to work, but rather, enjoy bloxton as a game. becoming a staff should become a honor here at bloxton, and losing your privilege of play is in no way an honor, things should change soon.
```
thats basically my argument before they cam back at me with "what if they just use the break to submit reports-  thus showing activity"

i then said "doesnt this mean they are active? if they are at the hotel - they ARE active - whether playing or being a Staff.


[10-May-20 03:53 PM] bman#0435
u spelled grammar wrong

"we're thinking of making grammer not a requirement."


[10-May-20 03:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh well

[10-May-20 03:53 PM] bman#0435
what abt mrs having breaks because that seemed to be their biggest concern lol


[10-May-20 03:53 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal some roblox news twitter said they are looking for news and i said that they should make an article on bloxton hitting 1 million and now i think they want to interview u and baby


[10-May-20 03:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
MRs are always on break by the fact that they just sit there


[10-May-20 03:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
LRs need it


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
more


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
tell them that too


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] ethan;#0003
someone is shutting down training servers


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
because me and trey saying it wasnt enough for them


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] ethan;#0003
like rn


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
their arguments seem more like looking down at the LRs for not wanting to work because they had to endure the trauma of working long days and hours - sorry to say but this isn't what I want bloxton to be - rank doesn't determine how scornful you can be on Lower ranks. I don't want people to lose sleep over a "promotion"


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
legit some people stay up for a promotion


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
its crazy


[10-May-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
tbh the mrs always want something to revolve around themselves when we do something for others


[10-May-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bear that's kind of their fault


[10-May-20 03:55 PM] bman#0435
like they ALWAYS want something for themeselves


[10-May-20 03:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can adjust this update, but i will not reconsider adding breaks i think it's a step in the right direction.


[10-May-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not really


[10-May-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Some actually took advantage of it just now


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I visited the hotel today and it was uhh


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
its simple we don't promote those who abuse breaks then


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
breaks are just there for - playing as a guest


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont get why as a staff i lose playing privileges


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
it makes no sense


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
and i dont like it


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but there's going to be some consistency problems


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
of course there is


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
that cant be helped


[10-May-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like stations beind left behind, trollers eventually running around, etc


[10-May-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think breaks is a good idea but


[10-May-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
before we add them i think u needa put out the update to organize them


[10-May-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
some/most mrs are confused about how we're supposed to tell if theyre on break or not


[10-May-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so we need a way to clear up the confusion


[10-May-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Exactly


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's the issue they have


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hell


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Several of them said they okay with it


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They're just not a fan of how it's executed


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but those are the ones that r willing to see the benefit of it


[10-May-20 03:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I agree with them of grammar not being used


[10-May-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not a good choice at all


[10-May-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's really distracting and kind of unprofessional


[10-May-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then again, they're a regular guest


[10-May-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
However, they do still hold a position


[10-May-20 04:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Basically I mostly disagree


[10-May-20 04:01 PM] a. ღ#4222
If they have breaks they should still use grammar


[10-May-20 04:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's one of the issues they have


[10-May-20 04:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
if they dont use grammar they will be reported lmao and we wont know if they are on their break or not


[10-May-20 04:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
also a break still means being professional in SOME sense


[10-May-20 04:02 PM] emma;#1525
we have to keep in mind that a lot of staff aren't in our discord server


[10-May-20 04:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And that's why we need something next to their name


[10-May-20 04:02 PM] emma;#1525
so they won't always know about our discord rules


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] emma;#1525
so if we make a rule that you can use grammar here BUT NOT THERE but yes here BUT NOT THERE it'll get really hard for non-discord users to follow


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] emma;#1525
it's probably better just to stick with always using grammar


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep I agree


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] emma;#1525
It's not like using grammar is hard anyways


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Way more consistency involved


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] emma;#1525
and they can always buy private servers if they want to use our rooms and not use gramma


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] emma;#1525
grammar


[10-May-20 04:03 PM] emma;#1525
like plenty of MRs and LRs host private servers


[10-May-20 04:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know you might say it's too strict so I'll probably just await for that


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
how about this, when on break, a tag appears in chat
``[BREAK][Beartikal]: hi guys im chatting``
Above their head we see:
```
Beartikal
17 | Vice Chairman
ON BREAK
```
now theres no way to report a false break user unless they check chatlogs, which will also contain "break" and "off break" chatlines


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
i think it's funny that bear and baby think we're strict but everyone I know who works as an MR or HR at a diff group says we're the most unprofessional, least strict group they know LOL


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal again with the communication issues though


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
no no bear


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
what u mean


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
what about


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
it's going to be impossible to get that information comminucated to all the people not in our discord server


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
so we have to keep that in mind


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How about this


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
you'd need a popup or something every time they clicked it that has the rules with it


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
then we'll communicate the idea in game


[10-May-20 04:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
''Beartikal
ON BREAK''


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
so they click the button and a popup shows up that says "Rules of being on break: 1) No trolling 2) You do NOT have to use grammar 3) Max break time is X" etc


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
and then they can x it out


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can either put it in the group page or-


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
YES EXACTLY


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal do you like that idea


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wanted a pop up


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
and then yes i like the "break" by their name thing


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
too


[10-May-20 04:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[10-May-20 04:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't want her lol


[10-May-20 04:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[10-May-20 04:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[10-May-20 04:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

candy is so good


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she is so professional too


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok we're thinking of no timer but rather just chat when you'd like the break to end


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think u need a timer


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
timer


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
a timer reminds me of prison


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and a staff break limit


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
the vote is literally 8-7 can we just hire both of them this is ridiculous lol


[10-May-20 04:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like 5 ppl at a time


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah but what if people who are staff just wanna be a hotel guest too?


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; we can hire the other soon after but lets take it slow


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Can staff even play the game normally at this point?


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal no you dont understand


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] katie#0200
can't they join on an alt


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
We dont even need receptionists because there is a self check in, so we're fine


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah i agree with katie


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i mean


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then get rid of the role lol


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
its gonna be better tojust hire both now if we know both will win "eventual" votes anyways bc they'll be prepared for summer


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if they want the job to work, they should work ngl


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
no katie because the alt account doesnt have the 'gamepasses' they paid for


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
.


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
instead of having to be traied


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
during the summer rush


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
bc summer break starts in like


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
2 weeks


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
for a lot of americans lol


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
WHAT 2 WEEKS?


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Does it matter lol @babymariobebe


[10-May-20 04:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes mine included


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
BRUH


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they could quit and come back when they want idk


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Some aren't really fortunate with robux fam


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yes, it does. If they bought a gamepass they cant use that makes us look bad


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
i dont see how summer has to do with hiring @emma;


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean like


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They can still use the gamepass with the limit


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hello


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hi


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
What are we talking about?


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah true


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
breaks


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
staff


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
something


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oh


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xM_inn breaks and hiring the new HRs


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I get what you're trying to do though


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
breaks


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
break system


[10-May-20 04:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I feel like staff should enjoy the game too if they'd like and not have to worry about activity. Remember guys the motivation behind them working is to get a promo, if they want it they work for it, no need to force them on to their desires.


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ngl i feel like it would be more trouble if breaks are allowed


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmm


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I agree


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563
what sort of trouble? thats so vague


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
plus we've been drilling it into everyones heads that they cant have breaks


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
oh im not against breaks


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
Staff deserve breaks though


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
well we're changing that aren't we @¢. ღ


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
but i dont know how we'll implement them smoothly


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
bc its impossible to get the notice out to everyone


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well if thats what everyone wants idc


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
who isnt in the discord


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
ur right it wont be smooth itll be suddenly in the gmae


[10-May-20 04:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
im just saying that it could be problematic involving them getting to go back to work


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Like I feel like the people in our game would have more fun if they can decide when to work, so they can do a shift when they want too


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
gucci bliss blops


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah that's my issue


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
@¢. ღ if they dont want to work they DO NOT have to - they just wont get promoted


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
theyll be like


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The reason for the self check in is exactly that


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
LOL BEAR


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But what about other jobs


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] katie#0200
even when staff don't have breaks, there's still servers without staff members


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah bear is right


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
breaks allow them to play as a player, if they are ALWAYS on beak they are the same as ap layer


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
tbh the hotel can run with just security


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
reminds me of sizzle kinda


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
exactly katie, that's the point of self check in


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yes bonnie


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not a good thing bliss lol


[10-May-20 04:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
exactly


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
self check in - housekeeping isnt required - people can starve so no bartenders


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ik trey


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I feel like we should change our mindset on breaks and lax tensions a bit


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
what do you mean sizzle do they have breaks or something


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh no my roblox avatar is not able to get a milkshake


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
since the hotel is easier to run now


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but it isn't very good


[10-May-20 04:13 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they also dont care if their staff uses grammar or not unless they want to get a promotion or something


[10-May-20 04:14 PM] katie#0200
the fact that staff dont have to use grammar there was kind of a disappointment because it does make their group look less professional too


[10-May-20 04:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
when on a break i dont care what they do unless they are trolling


[10-May-20 04:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
tbh


[10-May-20 04:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
what if all the staff go on break at once tho and theres no one to work


[10-May-20 04:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
then theres no staff in that server


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oof


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I mean its essentially just a staffless server in a way


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
no big deal


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
uhm


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
when somebody doesnt want to work - they just LEAVE Bloxton - this maeks it so that they DO NOT have to leave


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It kind of is


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
think about it


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
it is kinda  a deal tho


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] katie#0200
i mean if we have staff there and none of them working it does look bad


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
it jsut means they are a player


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal Is this something you'd be willing to do a *trial* on, say for like a week, and then we can decide to permanently implement it or not


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah i see ur point katie


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Besides receptionist, there's going to be other spots missing


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah you guys have to remember at the end of the day they're all just players, staff or not


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
bc i think if people can see how it works it would help them be more okay with it


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
OR it'll not work at all


[10-May-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
and then we wont do it lol


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] a. ღ#4222
how long are the breaks


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; the only way to see how it works is if we implement it


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
and see what happens


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
yeah ik so we'd implement it, saying it's only for a week to test it


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] emma;#1525
and then after a week we'd either keep it or delete it


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well, we dont know when someone will start their break even if theres a time limit to it


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
unless u have something thats like "oh this player started their break"


[10-May-20 04:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
theres indicators on their nametag and they chat to initiate it


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oooooooo


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I even see trollers saying to LRs "GET BACK TO WORK" its kinda horrible


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so does it like, show above their head?


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah above head kinda t hing


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oh thats cool, how long are you guys wanting the breaks?


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
currently we think they should be in charge of their break time


[10-May-20 04:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
timers shouldn't ruin their experience as a playee


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah like however long they feel necessary, this means it could also be used for an AFK thing too!


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I'm going AFK - **on break**


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
ok well them having unlimited break time is probably not a great idea


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hmm, but what if we need staff in a certain area and they just make the excuse that they're on their break and they have no reason to go back to work


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
I'm playing the game - **on break**


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
just being honest lol


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
I'm having a sleepover - **on break**


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
the break should last like 15 - 20 minutes


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ღ if its that long why even have a timer


[10-May-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
bc if we dont they'll be on for hours doing nothing


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
if i said 10 minutes yall would say its too short


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
i think 10 mins is perfect


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
10-15 mins?


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
i would want 10


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
but


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
ur choice


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
id say 10 is pretty good


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; yeah and if we dont implement breaks at all dont they just leave the game - in say - 5 minutes anwyay? This means they can play and not have to leave in fear of being punished


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
10 or 15


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal hey i said im in favor of breaks


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
but not unlimited time ones


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
bc thats not going to end well at all lol


[10-May-20 04:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
im in favor but i think there needs to be rules with it


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
i mean are we gonna allow MRs to take people off break if needed? Bc that's an issue with timelessbreaks if not


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
they wont have to listen to MRs if we let them be on break without having to be put back on


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
but if it's timed then at least there's a guideline


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
they can work when they want they arent dogs


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
LMAO


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
ok but they wont work at all if they dont have to LOL


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
that means they dont rank up


[10-May-20 04:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
the incentive to RANK UP is why they work


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
ik y'all love going to servers and having them all surround you and not work but on NORMAL servers we need them to work and lets be real only a few keep incentive to work to rank up anyways so great we'll have like 5 people actually working


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's going to sound mad confusing lol


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait I have an idea


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah they do it because A. They enjoy it. B. They want a promo.. Why did they apply if they dont want to do the job?? Emma that makes no sense


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why don't we let the community vote on this


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
people are just gonna go on breask every 10 minutes, switch to the next server and prob do it again


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
breaks*


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yikes, true story


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
I mean I applied to many places I don’t work at LOL


[10-May-20 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
That's a really good idea, but I would make it so they can't enter staff areas to annoy people actually working while they are on a break. Otherwise, I fully support the idea


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We could do a vote on announcements and see what they prefer


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] emma;#1525
plenty of people apply and don’t end up doing work


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] katie#0200
i agree with trey


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] emma;#1525
they’re all gonna vote breaks...


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
ya lmao


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] katie#0200
i mean if most mrs didnt idk


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but what type of breaks


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
cant they make an alt and call it a day 😄


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
One with a time limit or just no system??


[10-May-20 04:22 PM] emma;#1525
That’s Bc breaks will make it more work for MRs


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
Ofc they don’t want them


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
I mean if the bar is empty bc two bartenders are on break and the MR has NO authority anymore to ask them to work...


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
i wouldnt want it either


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] a. ღ#4222
do mrs get breaks then?


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
**actually I feel like they initially wanted the job, but the stressful rules has deterred them from doing the job, so they try to escape. If you contain people, they'll wanna be free. So this break thing would actually keep people WORKING in a weird way because they'll probably want to work now that people arent yelling at them to get back to work** Its reverse psychology


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can keep the breaks but we should let the community do it


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] a. ღ#4222
stressful rules


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] a. ღ#4222
what rules


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] a. ღ#4222
wth


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe again most people in other groups say we're the least strict and professional


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
just gonna point that out


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] emma;#1525
like i get HRs from other groups saying we are sooo unprofessional with trainings and stuff LOL


[10-May-20 04:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The "GET BACK TO WORK" rules I see MRs saying to LRs when they're trying to get a screenie with me...


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's obnoxious as hell sometimes


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
no cap they could be saying that to get ur attention


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
thats mrs being mrs


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
🙄


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
😳


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe bc you and bear literally ruin the entire workflow and it prevents guests from getting help.... like a screenshot is one thing but ive seen staff surround y'all for like 30 minutes and leave their stations


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Exactly bliss lol


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
hence why we want to LIMIT break time


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
bc yeah they should be able to take 10-15 minutes to have fun


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
"maybe if i show how cool i am in front of baby he will promote me OWO"


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
but they dont need to be on the hotel for an hour doing absolutely nothing


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i like the idea of breaks but i think there needs to be a time limit, a cooldown, and a way to tell if they are or arent on break


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah, and if we give LRs control over their situation, MRs dont have to be like that and LRs can form their own incentive to work rather than being forced to


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie yes


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The MRs say 5-10 minutes


[10-May-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
LRs are literally children they dont need control over anything LOL


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
bc they arent old enough to want to work for no incentive


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
they work bc they are told its what they have to do


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Trey, the MRs aren't the ones behind the counter most of the times, its the LRs


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
if we tell them they dont have to work


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] katie#0200
tbh those who want a promotion try to get our attention as much as possible


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
they wont


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
IKR KATIE


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
the ones who want a promo go to trainings more than the hotel


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I hate that so much katie lol


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
the promo thirsty ones just follow us lol


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] katie#0200
same omg


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the ones that rly want a promo cling to us like we're their parents


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] ethan;#0003
i just promoted retr0r0bot


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or like a puppy


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
we'll have to offer promo weeks all the time so the thirsty promo people keep working and dont go on break


[10-May-20 04:25 PM] katie#0200
i join the hotel and i get 4 lrs running up to me to say hi how are you why are you here


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it doesn't hurt to let the community vote for what they prefer


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Katie thats expected, they're only kids after all lol


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey i mean we've never let them vote before lol


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
To that extent, there's still replayability


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
we have an HR team to make those choices


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
i dont really want to let the LRs vote


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] katie#0200
exactly which is why i think if an hr is in the server and lrs can decide whether to work or not theyll chose not to work


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] emma;#1525
bc ultimately they vote in their own self interest whereas we discuss the hotel's best interest


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
since they represent Bloxtom, if they are immature on break or do anything a troller would - they can still be fired for that.


[10-May-20 04:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Ya


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal are we gonna get paid for terminations now since there will be a lot more of them lol


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I get it but we're trying to not encourage that lol


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
bc if we have unlimited breaks they'll be reported left and right


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's what I'm scared of


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
i mean im not saying this is too much of an issue but im just pointing it out there that we usually judge someones hotel activity based on reports and stuff. someone could just be on breaks all day and just send in a tonnn of reports like , i agree with breaks but we needa think of some things


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Emma what is with you and pay? Do you not get enough anymore or are you just obsessed with feeling like everything you do is requiring of pay?


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
I love money baby


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
immaturity is the only thing you can fire for if they are just playing, having fun, you cant report for that you also cannot report for refusal to work.


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
im inactive tho


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOL


[10-May-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
so im undeserving of pay

@babymariobebe @Beartikal ANYWAYS so yes I agree with breaks being a thing BUT considering that HRs and MRs are the ones who are at the hotel quite a bit and will be dealing with breaks, it would be kind if y'all would consider at least STARTING with timed breaks so we can see if they are abused or not before trying to do an "everyone decides for themselves"

[10-May-20 04:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; the honorable LRs will work because they want the promotion. The ones who abuse the system dont get promoted and dont have to work. Why make somebody work who never wanted to work in the first place? your dodging this logic.


[10-May-20 04:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809

@babymariobebe @Beartikal If y'all are gonna implement breaks how you want and not listen to any of our opinions then just do it lmao if you're gonna ignore us I don't want to spend hours fighting about it. We all are against unlimited breaks for the most part so you've heard our sides so just make a choice bc obviously we can't stop you


[10-May-20 04:34 PM] a. ღ#4222

alright with breaks mrs say that your tag should be displayed in the reports channel to prove that you are in fact not on break to report


[10-May-20 05:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma;


[10-May-20 05:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
+1 for me because they are starting to like the new idea

[10-May-20 05:12 PM] Beartikal#9760

[10-May-20 05:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
"but they can just reenable the break tag"
theres a cooldown to turn breaks back on!


[10-May-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal we all agreed with the break tag


[10-May-20 05:15 PM] emma;#1525
thats not a +1


[10-May-20 05:15 PM] emma;#1525

if we're gonna hire another one "pretty soon" just hire them both now


[10-May-20 05:17 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 05:17 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe @Beartikal we are the ones that will be affected by having more HRs the most so shouldn't our wants be taken into consideration with this lol you already got your way on the breaks


[10-May-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525

@Beartikal literally why dont we just hire 0 and then y'all can let us hire 2 when you're ready


[10-May-20 05:35 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 05:36 PM] emma;#1525
the vote is going to tie one way or the other lmao


[10-May-20 05:36 PM] bman#0435
either no vote and more time to see their activity or 2 hrs


[10-May-20 05:36 PM] Beartikal#9760

[10-May-20 05:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[10-May-20 05:37 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal are y'all going to allow us to hire 2 at once in a month tho


[10-May-20 05:37 PM] emma;#1525
because if you're not going to


[10-May-20 05:37 PM] emma;#1525
then there's no point


[10-May-20 05:37 PM] emma;#1525
like we want to cancel bc we want to hire both at once or neither bc its so close

well normally they won’t go inactive until they know we just hired another shift so they will probably be active until they see who the next shift is then go inactive lol

@Beartikal This is clearly really important to us, you haven't given us any legit reasons not to hire 2 other than "not now maybe later" so can you either let us have what we all want OR tell us why you refuse to hire two and we'll just put it off until later anyways

we've never had this happen where you REFUSE to hire 2 even though we really want two

@Beartikal Honestly it's more that to hire one over the other at this point is just unfair to both of them, they both clearly have a lot of support and would be great additions. Plus, we'll need the manpower in a month when everyone is on summer break and you release the big updates you keep talking about


[10-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
So if you're okay with hiring one NOW and one in a month...


[10-May-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
can we just hire 2 now....


[10-May-20 05:47 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

no it will remain as usual and we will see how things are in a month, we select spots based on when we need them not based on how fair it is to choose one over the other, decisions are hard but necessary


[10-May-20 05:53 PM] emma;#1525
honestly bman once you go inactive the pay rates will go way down bc you make too much


[10-May-20 05:54 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal but we'll need 2 in a month anyways


[10-May-20 05:54 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
What kind of leadership means you dont tell your HRs why you can't do something that they ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
this is really annoying


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
we're supposed to be a GOOD team


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 05:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
we feel it necessary to hire one now not two


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
we cant even get the reasoning


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
BUT WHY IS IT NECESSARY


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
Yes but why


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-20 05:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma is in sicko mode


[10-May-20 05:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
we dont need two for the fact that they are both good candidates you get they are both good and if you want you can tell the other that she will follow suit soon

@Beartikal its not even that the votes are equal (they arent rn) its that everyone agrees having both is MORE beneficial than just having one


[10-May-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
but i'll make them equal


[10-May-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525

[10-May-20 05:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
you need help - so a vote was cast to pick a winner - meaning 1 can win.
the other will follow. we dont change the rules because circumstances changed.


[10-May-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
But if circumstances changed that's the perfect reason to CHANGE THE RULES lol


[10-May-20 05:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But we want two fam lol


[10-May-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435
can i split myself in half and pick 2


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[10-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
what if we make anna and candy share an account


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] stacey#1000
Can I just point out majority of us voted 2 from the start


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
What rules, we’ve hired two at once before


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
then its 1


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
then no one will be bitching about so and so not being promoted or what not


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435

[10-May-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
11 HRs voted 2


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
^


[10-May-20 06:00 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal If you're refusing to let us have two because you think its dumb and that we're only doing it because they are so close that shows you haven't really listened to us because we want both due to them BOTH earning it and clearly being able to benefit us and it makes 0 sense to wait to get that benefit for a month if we're gonna hire them both anyways, literally no other senior is even being considered so we aren't going to have this issue again

I love it when people try to blame us for their own life decisions. You got bad grades? Your own fault. You don’t want to spend time with family? Your own choice. You got a family emergency and don’t care? Your own choice. People always just try to find something else to blame and it’s kind of sad.

also you shouldn't suspend or fire staff if they are doing bad things in their own group chat as it's not related to Bloxton in any way. you must only care about their life if it's at an allied representatives group or discord or other social group setting. If it's in a "discord of friends" or something I don't want to hear firing over dumb reasons like this.


[11-May-20 02:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
not related to any case just thought I'd make this clear


[11-May-20 03:02 AM] Cam#5887

so she came to training server when it was done

lced uses cups and tools to lag the server


[11-May-20 07:39 PM] Beartikal#9760

ban requests tho

[12-May-20 12:56 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn @xAfroTrey @emma; @bonnie591 you are all admins on the old unofficial ban requests board, if you can make all the HRs currently admins we can bring it back again and start using that board


[12-May-20 01:22 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal wud it be a new admin thingy or would u implement it with basic admin


[12-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
new admin


[12-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
i have full control there


[12-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
also Basic admin has chatlog issues now


[12-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
sometimes its blankj


[12-May-20 01:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
weird bug


[12-May-20 01:24 AM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal if you can make a custom ban system that would be pretty sweet


[12-May-20 01:25 AM] stacey#1000
if it would help with the board overflowing yes


[12-May-20 01:25 AM] emma;#1525
Like ethan said, makes ban appeals easier


[12-May-20 01:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
custom ban? lets talk about a custom admin
:flushedclown:


[12-May-20 01:25 AM] stacey#1000

[12-May-20 01:27 AM] emma;#1525
That’s an ego trip he doesn’t need


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] emma;#1525
Ya idc


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] stacey#1000
called ban request overflow board


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] stacey#1000
and also can yall help with clearing the mb more when u can


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] stacey#1000
its been overflowing a lot


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] ethan;#0003
the way this really goes is if emma like it it goes because emma has strong influence on everyone elses opinions


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] stacey#1000
and i cant host banning sessions all the time


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i rather pban them right away than actual timed ones ngl @Beartikal


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] emma;#1525
@ethan; I agreed with you tho


[12-May-20 01:27 AM] emma;#1525
So maybe it’s you who has influence


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] emma;#1525
😳😳😳😳


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] stacey#1000
adding a vote to make a ban requests overflow board


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it doesn't sound like a bad concept but i think i prefer just pbanning them


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey its for trollers


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
make a list to let shift managers host banning sessions agian


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
a vote


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
i remember in v5


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] emma;#1525
Again as if they ever could?


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
who's going to admin the seniors though lol


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
trollers dont deserve such harsh punishments and they always come whining for unbanning, this can teach them a lesson and also reduce the appeal list


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
shift managers did


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] Tattoblue#5828
no we couldnt lol


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] emma;#1525
only with a GM


[12-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
if someone came and admined the seniors


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] emma;#1525
Lol


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
a lot of them bypass the filter sooo


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] stacey#1000
go vote on what I put


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
no thanks


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] emma;#1525
But then a GM might as well host it


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
im sure the others might disagree though


[12-May-20 01:29 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[12-May-20 01:30 AM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 01:30 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[12-May-20 01:30 AM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 01:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
if thats tea then what is coffee jeeez


[12-May-20 01:30 AM] emma;#1525
Shifts can’t host ban sessions without a GM anyways


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
i wouldnt mind giving seniors admin and then leaving and allowing a shift to host it


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
oh


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] emma;#1525
What if seniors join partway through


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
yes


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
it used to be like that


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
in v5


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
i remember


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
slee would host banning sessions


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
and a gm would come and admin seniors


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
well what about adding a hr banning session for shifts where 2-4 shifts plan to help clear the board at the same time


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
literally the worst idea in any game that a lot of games used to do: vote to kick systems


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
OH MY GOD


[12-May-20 01:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
THAT IS SO BAD


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
a majority of trollers hop in the server - i think u know what happens next


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] emma;#1525
Let’s do it


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] ethan;#0003
omg im way too lazy for that im just SORRY


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] ethan;#0003

[12-May-20 01:32 AM] ethan;#0003
good idea


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000
lets do that so we can all vote to kick trey out


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] emma;#1525
I’m out of town oops I can’t


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] ethan;#0003
EMMA HELPS CLEAR THE BOARD AND ILL CLEAR LIKE 50% OF IT


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] emma;#1525
So sad


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] ethan;#0003
excuse


[12-May-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000

[12-May-20 01:32 AM] emma;#1525
Guess you don’t have to be active either

[12-May-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
and i cant do it all the time


[12-May-20 01:34 AM] Cam#5887
i would host a banning session yes


[12-May-20 01:34 AM] Cam#5887
but i dont got super admin so we cant


[12-May-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
give shifts superadmin at the hotel?


[12-May-20 01:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
what do you think of the idea of being able to Apply for an Application within Bloxton Hotels - NOT at a seperate group game?


[12-May-20 01:34 AM] ethan;#0003
YES


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
like !application


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
so when people sayu


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
where is the application center


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
also, i can make it open automatically on Sunday so we can be lazy


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal btw whats the update on new questions


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Cam#5887
oh yeah


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
it should be like a room in the hotel


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
they enter it and they can take teh application


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
and if they ask


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
we can say


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey later this week when i patch the exploits, basically the start of the week i have exams online and cant do much rnm


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Cam#5887
a lot of places have that as a GUI


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] ethan;#0003
"follow us to the application room"


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
nice


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
il do that


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] Cam#5887
thats pretty cool


[12-May-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
oki


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] Cam#5887
being able to apply inside of blxoton


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] Cam#5887
rather than going to a game


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] Cam#5887
i love that


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] ethan;#0003
you should also put something that shows how to join the group


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] ethan;#0003
for all the people who ask


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] ethan;#0003
how to join the group


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
How are you going to do that @Beartikal


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] ethan;#0003
like if they try to open the application thing in the hotel


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Just curious


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] ethan;#0003
it will tell them how to join the group


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
what part is hard to know?


[12-May-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal how do you feel about giving shifts super admin at the hotel so they can host banning sessions


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not much I kind of just want to know how's it gonna be executed overall


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] Cam#5887
at the hotel in general or like


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] Cam#5887
only in private servers


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] Cam#5887
@stacey


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
I mean only at the hotel


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
like hotel in general


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] Cam#5887
ohhh


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] Cam#5887
i see


[12-May-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
so then more people can help with hosting banning sessions!!!

attempt of rudeness?


[12-May-20 01:38 AM] Cam#5887

[12-May-20 01:38 AM] Cam#5887
it wasnt an attempt


[12-May-20 01:38 AM] Cam#5887
the user WAS being an ass


[12-May-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000

[12-May-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Are you going to bring back the ranking bot @Beartikal


[12-May-20 01:38 AM] Cam#5887

[12-May-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
oh


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
lol


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
it was pretty damn bad but


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
i think it could be like a 4 day suspension


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I would love for that to be back


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
wait what is the max suspension


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887

[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
10 days?


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
cause i wasnt told ever


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
5


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
5 days i see


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
and for trainees


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
the max is 3


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] Cam#5887
correct?


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
3 days for minor things


[12-May-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
and  5 for more major things


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] Cam#5887
yeah but for trainees


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] Cam#5887
is the max 3?


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] Cam#5887
i think thats what polk told me


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
i think so


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
most suspensions I do is 3 days


[12-May-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000

[12-May-20 01:40 AM] Cam#5887
ive done 4

but nothing other than 3 or 4 mainly


[12-May-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
because if its really major usually its fired


[12-May-20 01:41 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[12-May-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
why is the award place still open lol


[12-May-20 01:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can make it on the UI and it shows a thing that says "Work here!" or like it shows a clipboard emoji and when u click it a chipboard opens with the application paper and all its questions. You clcik submit when your done. It will also detect plagiarized answers, bad keywords, and also tell you the STATUS of your aplication so we dont have "When is my application done"


[12-May-20 01:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
it will work amazing


[12-May-20 01:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey


[12-May-20 01:42 AM] Cam#5887
bear


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] Cam#5887
we dont have access to a time ban tho


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] Cam#5887
so would u add that


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] Cam#5887
?


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
it would be in my new admin system


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
im designing one for Bloxton


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm bear


[12-May-20 01:43 AM] Cam#5887
ooooooooooooooooooooooo


[12-May-20 01:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
you should have bypassers included to the pban too


[12-May-20 01:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
i do


[12-May-20 01:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
what do u think of the application gui idea


[12-May-20 01:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
mentioned above


[12-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i like the idea


[12-May-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
i like it


[12-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think that'll work


[12-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's one thing i'm excited for of the next update


[12-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-May-20 01:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
personally i like the interactive housekeeping system


[12-May-20 01:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
and room service


[12-May-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
So how’s room service going to work exactly. Is it like a phone thing bartenders will get


[12-May-20 01:55 AM] stacey#1000
And will it only work if there is a bartender on the server


[12-May-20 01:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
bingo! 🔴


[12-May-20 01:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
if theres no server, the food is automatically rewarded


[12-May-20 01:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
they select a pre-written response with the choices they'd like! No phone spamming or ugly trollers


[12-May-20 01:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
it shows an indicator on the phone, and bam - they answer it


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
and will there be a phone cooldown?


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
each player will have an individual cooldown


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
after each call


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
so there is no spam


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
correct


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
yea


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
and no ugly chatting either


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
how long? like 10 minutes?


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
10 minutes works


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
yeah either or


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
i mean tbh


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
u could be able to make it


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
like if they got a small order


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
5 minutes


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
big order 10 minutes


[12-May-20 01:57 AM] Cam#5887
just a thought


[12-May-20 01:58 AM] Beartikal#9760
a new tool will be given to bartenders: Food Tray, where it stores all the food in the order and upon giving to the player, the food tray is unpacked into their requested meal - you must own a room to call room service and it will be delivered to your location, if the delivery takes too long - it is canceled


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Cam#5887
ooo


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Cam#5887
that sounds cooooooooool


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
if you check out - it is canceled


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
iof you leave - it is canceled


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] stacey#1000
That’s awesome


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Cam#5887
thats really really cool


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
each bar can only pick up one request at a time


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
it also shows a guide arrow to the player's location who requested the meal


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] stacey#1000
I can’t wait to test that out


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Cam#5887
and to ask, will the buffet where guests can get their food individually


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Cam#5887
be\


[12-May-20 01:59 AM] Cam#5887
included?


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Cam#5887
like the cheeseburgers


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Cam#5887
etc


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
not likely


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] stacey#1000
Are any new items being added to the bar or no?


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
maybe ice cream


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Cam#5887
ooo


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] stacey#1000
Yess


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
a lot of requests


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
siad they wanted ice cream


[12-May-20 02:00 AM] stacey#1000
Literally every time guests think the milkshake flavours is ice cream flavours and they ask for ice cream


[12-May-20 02:01 AM] Cam#5887

[12-May-20 02:01 AM] Cam#5887

[12-May-20 02:01 AM] Cam#5887
mint + strawberry


[12-May-20 02:01 AM] Cam#5887
O_O


[12-May-20 02:01 AM] Beartikal#9760
interactive housekeeping works like this: players can use the same phone to call for room cleaning, which a mess is purposely made in the users' room

bman is adding people in 2 seconds so nbm


[12-May-20 01:36 PM] stacey#1000
nvm


[12-May-20 01:36 PM] stacey#1000
LOL


[12-May-20 01:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so how does this work


[12-May-20 01:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
do we


[12-May-20 01:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ban directly from here if the MB gets filled?


[12-May-20 01:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or we move them to the MB then ban


[12-May-20 01:38 PM] bman#0435
ig when the mb reaches 600 theyll put the overflowed reports here so channels dont build up


[12-May-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[12-May-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
then we can transfer all the cards over after and then delete them


[12-May-20 01:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut


[12-May-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
btw stacey if ur gonna announce for them to dm me their trello to be added my dms r open, so do it when ur ready. ill be finishing my english work lol


[12-May-20 01:41 PM] stacey#1000
oki


[12-May-20 01:42 PM] Cam#5887
so much better


[12-May-20 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
ok going to announce soon


[12-May-20 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
@Cam do you want to have your dms open too to add people to the board


[12-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 is this board unofficial like the last one


[12-May-20 02:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
ig it can be official since the hrs own it


[12-May-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[12-May-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
u should add that if they have questions abt it to contact an hr in the last card


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
what about seniors with banning sessions


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
should they be allowed to transfer the cards to the management board after


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
they have the senior board


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
o


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think its good


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
i would just say


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
they archive mb first


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
then they archive overflow board


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
r the


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
i dont see a reason to transfer 600 more cards over


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
overflow cards getting moved to the MB before they get archived


[12-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
so wait we dont even need to transfer cards


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
no not rly


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
we just archive it


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
we didnt on the old board


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
we just archived


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
since its an official board


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the overflow board is official?


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
alright so that means we have to add every manager


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
lol


[12-May-20 02:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
u could make the overflow board the board


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bman#0435
then whats the point of mb


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
so management board hasnt got ban requests which lags t


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
it


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
the mb is for the other lists it has on it


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bman#0435
why is there even a limit tbh


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
because too much makes it laggy


[12-May-20 02:04 PM] bman#0435
but the thing is for those lists we can easily just make discord channels for them or have them do what lrs do


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
for example, make a ticket for suggestions or submit it to the form


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
u would have to scroll so farr up lmao


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
and for logs, just make discord channels


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
im confused now


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we have the overflow board so the discord doesnt overflow


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
discord is harder 2 organize


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
i dont see a reason to archive bans from mb lmfao


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
same


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
just put all bans there?


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
this board is just for when there is too many ban requests


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
ya u fill it to 600 on mb then add the rest to overflow


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
and they can add more ban requests to this board


[12-May-20 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[12-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
this board is only to be used when that happens


[12-May-20 02:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[12-May-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435
the mb isnt even that laggy or chaotic. if u want laggy or chaotic then go to the application board or hr board lol


[12-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
but of course the overflow board limit is 600 ban requests too


[12-May-20 02:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg the hr board is so laggy


[12-May-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
if it goes over that they wait


[12-May-20 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
ok im going to announce but can other people have their dms open to add them to the board


[12-May-20 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
i dont want ot get a million dms


[12-May-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 can u archive the appeals list. theres over 150+ appeals that date back to june 2019


[12-May-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435
unless those cards dont get archived

[12-May-20 02:09 PM] bman#0435
can we also, as a team, knitpick the suggestions. theres over 80 and half of them are definitely duplicated or just something no one would consider


[12-May-20 02:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes pls do


[12-May-20 02:09 PM] bman#0435

[12-May-20 02:09 PM] bman#0435
"add a ranking bot"


[12-May-20 02:09 PM] bman#0435

[12-May-20 02:10 PM] bman#0435

NEW BAN REQUESTS OVERFLOW BOARD

Greetings Managers,

    I am happy to introduce you all to the ban requests overflow board! As you all know, the management board has been filling up a lot in the span of 2 days with it’s max limit of 600 ban requests for the hotel. With increased hotel activity, this was to be expected. However, the HR team has decided a solution to this issue!

    The HR team has decided to create the ban requests overflow board that can be used when this occurs. The way this will work is when the management board hits 600 ban requests, you may add more ban requests to this board. The same rules that apply to the management board will apply to this board. You will use the same format to create a card!

    Of course, leaking this board is strictly prohibited as it is for the management board. The ban requests limit on this board will also remain at 600 cards just like the management board. If you go over 600 cards on the overflow board, you will need to wait before accepting anymore reports as there is only one overflow board. 

    You will all be added to the board shortly, and you DO NOT need to dm me your usernames for trello, but if you are not added to the board tomorrow you may message me to let me know. In the next hour or two you may have a look at the new board as hopefully everyone will be added by then and if you have any questions regarding how it works, feel free to ask any member of the HR team. More information about this will be provided on the board. Have a good day everyone!
Sincerely, 
staceyzn
General Manager 
Bloxton Hotels

[12-May-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435
she said that meme told joanna who told swan, and swan told me. i just told swan that joanna shouldnt even be believing information from someone who is seeking so much attention

[12-May-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
i never talked to her


[12-May-20 03:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they harassed her at the hotel with an account saying she doesn't deserve 11 lol


[12-May-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
they created accounts saying promote her to rank 11 too


[12-May-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
and meme put in her bio to promote bri


[12-May-20 03:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she then later proceeds to go on that account lmao


[12-May-20 03:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're hella confusing and hypocritical lol


[12-May-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
tbh i just feel like bri could be a possible threat at the moment. im clearly being targetted by meme for some reason and bri is fairly close to meme


[12-May-20 03:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[12-May-20 03:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-May-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
@bman honestly I wouldn’t let it scare you. She is trying to get you to worry. If she really does dox you, take it to the authorities and she can get it real trouble


[12-May-20 03:40 PM] bman#0435
ya but i dont think my parents even know i have discord sooooooooooooo


[12-May-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000

[12-May-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
Well she probably won’t succeed so


[12-May-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[12-May-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
not sure y she wants to know my name or what my face is anyways


[12-May-20 03:41 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey but tbh please reconsider bri for this moment


[12-May-20 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey take anj0las card instead if you still want to promote someone to management


[12-May-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t mind


[12-May-20 03:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[12-May-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
There will be yes


[12-May-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
Like they can’t just come on a server and be on break the whole time


[12-May-20 03:45 PM] bman#0435

[12-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 04:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
lced's exploiters are made by the user python


[12-May-20 04:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
he goes by pythion on discord


[12-May-20 04:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
yesterday they got in a fight so i got lced's script from him


[12-May-20 04:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
lucky me


[12-May-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait what


[12-May-20 04:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
their scirpt maker din't like how lced was taking all the credit for the script because in a way everybody knwos that lced exploits


[12-May-20 04:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So he leaked their exploit??


[12-May-20 04:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
the real person who writes it for her got mad, and so lced ditched him - in short - he came to me and said "heres the exploit lced uses" and WANTS me to patch it - before he did it with lced


[12-May-20 04:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
now he wants it patched


[12-May-20 04:09 PM] Beartikal#9760

I'm sorry I gotta laugh


[12-May-20 04:11 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 04:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats what it is


[12-May-20 04:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
Exploiters tend to have "Whitelist" to determine "whos cool enough" to use their exploit scripts


[12-May-20 04:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait so


[12-May-20 04:12 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 04:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
it started because lced was known for the credit of shutting down exploits


[12-May-20 04:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
and the other guy wanted the credit ahaha


[12-May-20 04:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Are they really arguing with each other over who's experience they about to ruin 😂


[12-May-20 04:14 PM] Beartikal#9760

She seems like an innocent person that was banned and may have been accidentally banned

Breezy's our ally demoting all the HRs and free ranking new ones, major inactivity, etc


[12-May-20 08:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
who's running the group anyways


[12-May-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
Builder_Boy, our builder for V6, thats why we never messed with that ally


[12-May-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
he doesnt do anything with it though


[12-May-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
the Vice chairman does


[12-May-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
and apparently a old vice chairman that actually put care in the group


[12-May-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
Quit


[12-May-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-May-20 08:45 PM] xM_inn#2821

[12-May-20 08:45 PM] Beartikal#9760

it needs 1 more vote


[12-May-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
the reason i cant exactly go to authorities is because swan didnt have proof since it was over snapchat, i have no clue what memes snapchat it, and my parents dont know i have discord lol


[12-May-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000

[12-May-20 10:32 PM] a. ღ#4222

[12-May-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she's clearly being uncooperative at this point


[12-May-20 10:33 PM] a. ღ#4222
i dont think she will admit anything honestly


[12-May-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what i wanna know is why tango seems offended here


[12-May-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's not fair for any of the mrs to deal with her hot mess


[12-May-20 10:33 PM] a. ღ#4222
i mean me and tango dont hate each other so i could ask her questions but who knows


[12-May-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-May-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is what i said to her:

xAfroTrey03/26/2020
Hate to be that guy to contacts people over this.
But why did you decide it was okay to bypass at the hotel and annoy your former co-workers at trainings by being disruptive not once, but twice?
emma03/26/2020
idk
xAfroTrey03/26/2020
Wait, so let me get this straight. You're telling me you had no idea why you proceeded to act obnoxiously towards an LR during your testing, refused to head into staff lines, and now bypassing at the hotel? All of these in separate occasions and your only response is that you don't know. If that's how you're handling your role on the line and trying to stay on the Discord, you must really have no concept on maintaining good behavior. At this point, I'm not sure why you're thinking on why you're not at fault for those situation(s). If you want to continue, be my guest. But you're only pushing yourself on a possible blacklist, so let's agree not make it harder for both parties. Thank you.


[12-May-20 10:34 PM] emma;#1525
thats not even from staff lounge

[12-May-20 10:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I find it strange cause Kenzi resigned because of Ava and Meme


[12-May-20 10:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ava and Meme accused her of leaking so 🤔


[12-May-20 10:45 PM] bman#0435
no she knew what was coming to her


[12-May-20 10:45 PM] bman#0435

[12-May-20 10:46 PM] a. ღ#4222
should we ask tango when she got sent that message?


[12-May-20 10:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Omar isn't getting promoted anytime soon


[12-May-20 10:46 PM] a. ღ#4222

[12-May-20 10:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-May-20 10:48 PM] a. ღ#4222

[12-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
@bman the MRs were talking about it in staff lounge too


[12-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
would defo warn bc thats not professional at all


[12-May-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
ya but bear also said that staff could use the tools as they wish so im stuck


[12-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
not sure bear meant "hit each other with pillows"


[12-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
but even if he did


[12-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
thats a dumb rule lmao


[12-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
we're already known as the "unprofessional" group


[12-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
when did bear tell them they can use the tools as they want


[12-May-20 11:40 PM] bman#0435
lemme find it


[12-May-20 11:42 PM] emma;#1525
if it wasnt officially announced to anyone its not a rule lol and therefore a warning can still be applied, it just being said here doesnt count


[12-May-20 11:42 PM] bman#0435
bruh i def read either baby or bear say it but i fant find it


[12-May-20 11:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no I know what u mean bman. I think they said not to warn for pillows and all that


[12-May-20 11:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Something along those lines


[12-May-20 11:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Cause polk was making new rules for new update


[12-May-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
ya it was like they can use those tools since they bought them and we shouldnt punish them for being fun


[12-May-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
i literally swear bear said something along those lines here


[12-May-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
He said they can use the hotel items


[12-May-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But they can’t abuse the staff ones


[12-May-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So I’m assuming they can do that.


[12-May-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?*


[12-May-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[12-May-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
lmao dobby trying to sound cool by saying baby and bear are friends with him on roblox is funny


[12-May-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
but you should ask baby about that, if he really did put a script in


[12-May-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
or bear


[13-May-20 12:54 AM] Beartikal#9760
@PackItUpMack no coding cool


[13-May-20 12:54 AM] Beartikal#9760
it super neat what u can do with it


[13-May-20 12:54 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal read up ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


[13-May-20 12:54 AM] Tattoblue#5828
n00b


[13-May-20 12:55 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes we ran that on him


[13-May-20 12:55 AM] Beartikal#9760
its baby's ragdoll scirpt


[13-May-20 12:55 AM] Beartikal#9760
dvobby right


[13-May-20 12:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; correct they can use any tool


[13-May-20 12:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
maybe not pillows or water guns while on duty


[13-May-20 12:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
but any tool can be used when want


[13-May-20 01:00 AM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal i mean they should only be using them properly


[13-May-20 01:00 AM] emma;#1525
no reason for staff to be running around spraying each other with the spray bottle


[13-May-20 01:33 AM] Polk#1596
LOL YEAH @Bloo_Berriez


[13-May-20 01:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
they're kids emma let them have fun


[13-May-20 01:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
if its not hateful or targeted or unrequested then its alright


[13-May-20 01:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's distracting as hell though lol


[13-May-20 01:38 AM] Beartikal#9760
if its 2 staff that r toying with each other dont intervene


[13-May-20 01:38 AM] Beartikal#9760
when they bring other staff into the mix you can enforce at will


[13-May-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think it more so depends how they handle the whole thing but it's clearly for housekeeping use


[13-May-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
speaking of which


[13-May-20 01:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't know if you have this yet but


[13-May-20 01:39 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
the spray bottle could be used for windows


[13-May-20 01:40 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
apart of me thinks that's going to be in the mega update but if you haven't, you should definitely have a smear effect or something to make the windows dirty @Beartikal


[13-May-20 01:41 AM] Beartikal#9760
o cool


[13-May-20 01:41 AM] Beartikal#9760
thinking of floors for the vacuum


[13-May-20 01:41 AM] Beartikal#9760
spray bottle for smears then


[13-May-20 01:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
why not both @Beartikal


[13-May-20 01:43 AM] emma;#1525
I’m not gonna let staff go around spraying each other for 10 minutes


[13-May-20 01:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
did it last that long @emma;


[13-May-20 01:44 AM] emma;#1525
If it’s like 20 seconds of fun whatever


[13-May-20 01:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
if that's the case, that's wayyy too long


[13-May-20 01:44 AM] emma;#1525
trey it was (mostly) an exaggeration


[13-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh i know now


[13-May-20 01:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i entered it before i read the 20 second message


[13-May-20 01:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait better yet


[13-May-20 01:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
why not have like small crumbs on the ground @Beartikal


[13-May-20 01:58 AM] Beartikal#9760
if has to be noticable we will amek it around areas like trash cans

@emma;


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also notice how they showed the channels but not really the content


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
well they can see the content and itwont be white


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Whatever the case may be, I think this is what happened


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
can we archive ban logging


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525

[13-May-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
lol


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525
Doubt we’ll need it again


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
it was a one time use thing


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525
and if we do we can just remake it


[13-May-20 02:11 PM] bman#0435
ya


[13-May-20 02:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think meme snuck in and used the plugin itself to basically manipulate that someone leaked to her


[13-May-20 02:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I banned her alt since she revealed herself but I don't think she's particularly done yet


[13-May-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Btw who sent you that screenshot @bman


[13-May-20 02:13 PM] emma;#1525
lol I’m not sure what meme thinks she can even do


[13-May-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Was it bri herself


[13-May-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
All she's gonna do is continue being pathetic lol


[13-May-20 02:15 PM] bman#0435
ya bri


[13-May-20 02:18 PM] a. ღ#4222

[13-May-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435
but he sold it


[13-May-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435
and i still had my rank


[13-May-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435
and they demoted me because they saw i worked here


[13-May-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435

@bonnie591 https://trello.com/c/EHIl79at/32543-application-status y is that a suggestion when the seniors asked for apps to be open 24/7


[13-May-20 02:45 PM] bman#0435
lol


[13-May-20 02:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
hmm been seeing Vedom14 at hotel a lot


[13-May-20 02:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
dk who he is


[13-May-20 02:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
how does seniors asking apps to be open 24/7 affect that suggestion @bman


[13-May-20 02:56 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal he follows every hr/mr around


[13-May-20 02:56 PM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 because theres no need for the application status if its constantly open


[13-May-20 02:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats not what that means


[13-May-20 02:56 PM] bman#0435
o then what does it mean


[13-May-20 02:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
application status = people who apply can see if they have passed or failed


[13-May-20 02:56 PM] bman#0435
because i was thinking of like the old one where on the senior board it would say OPEN or CLOSED


[13-May-20 02:57 PM] bman#0435
ohhh ok that makes more sense


[13-May-20 02:57 PM] bman#0435
can u specify that on the card


[13-May-20 02:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809

you cant do anything to somebody who leaked you cursing if thats what this is about


[13-May-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he leaked the staff lounge lol


[13-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was trying to appeal in the process but got rejected


[13-May-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
he leaked staff lounge yes


[13-May-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000

[13-May-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
lucas was already fired and blacklisted


[13-May-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
so all we can do is not allow him to appeal


[13-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think he was trying to get revenge on the group by posting this 💀

[13-May-20 10:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
you can sometimes appear on a Roster for a sports team online with your full name


[13-May-20 10:47 PM] bman#0435
thats why i think they have some 4 yesr old photo of me from my moms facebook or they got it from my sosters instagram


[13-May-20 10:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they have your state its not too hard


[13-May-20 10:47 PM] bman#0435

[13-May-20 10:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they can swat him


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] bman#0435
i dont want people knowing my name


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
ah


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
mayb u can try teling discord


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i guess


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] bman#0435
especially my last name


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] a. ღ#4222
its just security issues


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
for me i cant relate as my name and face and state is already out there


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
u had no choice since u went for the roblox dev event


[13-May-20 10:48 PM] bman#0435
how do i report a discord user on mobile


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
maybe pc is better


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] bman#0435
well honestly reporting wont do shit. theyll just remake another account


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] bman#0435
and they have my name and face no matter what


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] bman#0435
i mean technically we can


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
then nothing else u can do tbh if u go authorities


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] bman#0435
what theyre doing is illegal


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
they are online personas


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
unless u can get their info out


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] bman#0435
since they have bad intentions


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im tempted to make a response addressing this but this is only going to worsen the situation


[13-May-20 10:49 PM] a. ღ#4222
nah no response


[13-May-20 10:50 PM] bman#0435
i dont want to respond to joanna because i feel like itll just feed in


[13-May-20 10:50 PM] bman#0435
omg i cant take this rn


[13-May-20 10:50 PM] bman#0435

[13-May-20 10:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
i guess since roblox is a "kids game"


[13-May-20 10:52 PM] Beartikal#9760

[13-May-20 10:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[13-May-20 10:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman you cant do anything about it the best u can do is ignore it?


[13-May-20 10:59 PM] bman#0435
i cant just ignore that they are going to expose my face and full name to thousands of people...


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
you had to have gave something away other than a first name and state


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but at same time u dont know for sure if thet actually have it


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
they could just be saying that


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
to scare you


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] bman#0435
i just want to resign because i dont feel safe anymore


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
which is what they're doing rn


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] bman#0435
bloo they said my full fucking name


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
they're scaring you


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
they actually have it?


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
did the ysay middle name or no


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] bman#0435
yes


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] bman#0435
no


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i thought u said they didnt


[13-May-20 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we-


[13-May-20 11:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wth


[13-May-20 11:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how did they get it


[13-May-20 11:01 PM] bman#0435
i said they didnt get it because i didnt want to actually get doxxed and for u guys to get involved to the point of where it motivates them to doxx me


[13-May-20 11:01 PM] bman#0435
for example, emma asked me if she wanted me to dm meme about it


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
no ur suppose to ignore it say nothing to them


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
but they did get my name right which scares me to death


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
bear


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
the doxxer didnt say it to me


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
the doxxer told someone else who told the person who told me


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
i denied it to them


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
even tho it was right


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats even creepier


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
this is all too much for me


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
spoooooky


[13-May-20 11:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i literally have no words to describe the kinda ppl they are. how do they freaking find this kinda stuff. they're such weirdos to be even doing that.


[13-May-20 11:03 PM] bman#0435
i just want to get off the roblox platform and discord now


[13-May-20 11:03 PM] bman#0435
i honestly just want to resign like right now


[13-May-20 11:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bman i would just take a break


[13-May-20 11:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
don't let them win


[13-May-20 11:04 PM] bman#0435
and let them spread my name and face around while im unaware of it happening?


[13-May-20 11:04 PM] bman#0435
i dont feel safe anymore


[13-May-20 11:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman dont quit for it - they have it either way


[13-May-20 11:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[13-May-20 11:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
see eventually


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you're possibly going to regret the decision and i don't want that happening


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
a lot of former hrs regret quitting, especially those taken from rash decisions


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] bman#0435
the only thing id honestly miss is u guys (and my pay teehee) but i generally dont feel safe anymore


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
listen i know it really sucks and i've dealt with this firsthand


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
a lot of people want to be in the place where u r rn just remember that


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[13-May-20 11:05 PM] bman#0435
and i dont want them making a yt video with my face and u guys putting it in this chat pinging me asking if its me


[13-May-20 11:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but you can't rationalize irrational people


[13-May-20 11:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
be strong man


[13-May-20 11:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
BMAN


[13-May-20 11:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
I LOVE U OK


[13-May-20 11:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
its happened where hrs regret the day after leaving. just think it out before making a decisions. take a day break or week break, but dont make the automatic decision  u wanna resign now cause u will regret it later


[13-May-20 11:06 PM] a. ღ#4222

[13-May-20 11:12 PM] bman#0435
i dont want people to see my fucking face. im so insecure about myself and its just so annoying how people feel the need to "expose" others. and at this point i just dont feel safe to be on discord or roblox anymore and i want to be over it


[13-May-20 11:12 PM] stacey#1000
thats it im making an announcement to so u can hear my idea


[13-May-20 11:12 PM] Beartikal#9760

@stacey they cant do anything


[13-May-20 11:12 PM] bman#0435
my parents dont know i have discord and i have no proof they have my naem or face


[13-May-20 11:12 PM] stacey#1000
doxing yes they can


[13-May-20 11:12 PM] bman#0435

[13-May-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
if they expose your personal information and stuff yes they can


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] bman#0435
i cant be like "meme has my face and name" and expect them to go to meems house


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
its illegal to dox


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
bman they tried it with me before... they said they were ready to get me fired with all this proof, and im still waiting for it. they even had the chance to expose m in the video but instead use photoshopped proof... they literally threaten and dont actually make a move.


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] bman#0435
i dont have proof of them saying it tho


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] bman#0435
its all been from seccond hand sources with no proof


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
then ask them for proof


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] bman#0435
swan said she didnt get proof since it was over snapchat


[13-May-20 11:13 PM] a. ღ#4222

making a q n a addressing this stuff wont be any useful when they just keep making these videos


[13-May-20 11:20 PM] a. ღ#4222
a lot of people are scared and scared for their safety and i feel bad for them


[13-May-20 11:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[13-May-20 11:21 PM] a. ღ#4222

[13-May-20 11:21 PM] stacey#1000

@Bloo_Berriez


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
why do we have the "Former MR" role on the discord anyway its just an ego boost


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] stacey#1000
can we delete the former MR role like boba did


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] Beartikal#9760

[13-May-20 11:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
why do they even need that role


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] stacey#1000
majority of the formers are literally toxic


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no let them dig their own hole


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] stacey#1000
therefore no one deserves a former role


[13-May-20 11:34 PM] stacey#1000

[13-May-20 11:35 PM] Beartikal#9760

[15-May-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; I blacklisted her because after the tea video was made, that whole server with meow and cinder she is really involved in.


[15-May-20 02:35 PM] emma;#1525
Define involved


[15-May-20 02:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She also helped out Ava to raid at the Hotel.


[15-May-20 02:35 PM] emma;#1525
Like is she hating on people and such


[15-May-20 02:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes.


[15-May-20 02:35 PM] emma;#1525
I honestly have no idea bc I've been gone for 3 days


[15-May-20 02:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She was trash-talking as well.


[15-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here, I'll find some proof.


[15-May-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
Can someone send pics ty


[15-May-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
She literally said herself: I won't be surprised if I get blacklsited.


[15-May-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
I will send link to her blacklist card.

[15-May-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
her role in the server itself is "fav"


[15-May-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000

[15-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i lowkey think this should be addressed because like


[15-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it led to leaked pictures, loads of talk about it in general discussion, and shit like that


[15-May-20 07:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
cant the video get taken down bc it has cam in it?

[15-May-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-May-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
cinder legit wants u to join their bloxton hate server-


[15-May-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-May-20 07:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-May-20 07:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it was press conference 7


[15-May-20 07:41 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
i suggested making it into a conference but we decided not to

[15-May-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-May-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
just a q&a not a press conference


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well technically a lot of us planned it


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[15-May-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
uh


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
no


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think cyto did most of them, then emma hosted the most recent one


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
that's going to make this so much worse


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
trust me


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i had to read all 66 pages D:


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
ive been talking to cinder a bit already


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what's going to be even worse honestly


[15-May-20 07:42 PM] emma;#1525
if we address this we give it credibility even if we deny everything, and cinder and meow have a perfect reason to make it seem like we're covering up for people


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] stacey#1000
I dont see whats so bad with us giving our side


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
i PROMISE you that not addressing it is better


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if he doxes individuals, spreads misleading information, and much more, why shouldn't we say anything?


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
cinder and meow already have the leading hand over this becuase they have nothing to lose and if we release a doc that they'll automatically use and twist to make it seem like we're LYING


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc they might do it again?


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
to


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
when we dont even know all the proof cinder has (bc he claims to have more)


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u specifically


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
it's going to end so badly


[15-May-20 07:43 PM] emma;#1525
y'all cannot do that lol sorry thats not happning **right now** of all times


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i guess that makes sense


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
most of the shit in that video was true enough anyways


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean, the aftermath of the tea didn't end so hot either


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
like i said everything i said that was exposed


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
cant deny that


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
yeah they took it out of context but like


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
HS was dealt with HORRIBLY we can't deny that


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
they are literally bringing in new people to raid the hotel


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] emma;#1525
jack is a whole other story we can't deny bc its true


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
because of this


[15-May-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
idk why they even mentioned jack tbh


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
didnt most of the stuff about jack happen after he left


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
ik stacey but what exactly are we refuting in this tea video response when most of the shit they said did happen lmao


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my thing is if we stay silent now, that's going to make think we're hiding something


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ohhh there's a lot actually


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
no if we refute it it's going to be interpreted as a coverup


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
and we're adding fuel to a fire we have little control over


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait how is that the case


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
100% whatever we do, cinder and meow will twist it their way


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think either way somethings gonna happen


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
look


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
the only people that care about the vid and think it's true are people that already hate us


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
well if u decide not to post the doc its fine with me


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
ok i gtg bye


[15-May-20 07:45 PM] emma;#1525
i mean posting ANY sort of response is 100% a BOD call


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean i rather have us defend ourselves than let them twist it


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyll probs make another vid saying "they didnt respond bc they know its true" so i dont rly think we can make it much better either way


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm mkay


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
trey we won't be defending ourselves if it's twisted


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
i cannot express enough how bad of an idea it is to release a doc on this


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
im waiting for the day im in a tea video


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
you're releasing a doc on a video that honestly was partly true anyways


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what's wrong saying it is twisted


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
we dont have the upper hand trey


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lowkey 1/4 of it was true


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
and you'll be giving it attention


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
only like


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
4k people have seen it


[15-May-20 07:46 PM] emma;#1525
we have way more than that in our discord server


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o i didnt think about that


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's still hella people emma


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
so you're going to give 20k people the chance to look up that video, watch it, see the comments, and be pulled into cinder and meow's reach??


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
NO ITS NOT we're a 1m group


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wouldnt they bring more attention to the video then?


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
4k is NOTHING to us


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that*


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
yes it would bring so much more attention to the video


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
i agree with emma


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
eventually people will get over it


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
we've never released a single statement on a tea doc before


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
and we cant stop people hating the group


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya i think if its gonna make more ppl  watch the video then we shouldnt announce it


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] emma;#1525
i dont see how this is different


[15-May-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
we just ban everyone that raids and wastes their time raiding at the hotel


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] stacey#1000
there will always be more people


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
no one was doxxed, all the photos they got were legal (cam and mushy dated like ofc she had photos of him and if she gives them to other people its not doxxing and darren posted his selfies lol those have been public for a while)


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
there's no reason to address THIS tea vid when we've ignored all the other ones


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] stacey#1000
it wasnt even darren


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
even better then


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] emma;#1525
the fake bloo photo gets me every time


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was going to say that lol


[15-May-20 07:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what about june though


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
kinda interesting how they think bloo is that kid at the end of their video still lol


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im very sure that's hella illegal


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
we cant stop people from assuming her age


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not that


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
her face is in the end


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
that was a pfp of her public youtube video


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
june has never said her age in the discord so that's not an issue and im pretty sure that pic of her has been around before but idk


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that was who they thought bloo as?


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
anyone could see that


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
was*]


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
YES COOKIE LOL


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] emma;#1525
people have been saying that's him for years now its so funny


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ikr


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
YES THEY THOUGHT IT WAS BLOO 💀


[15-May-20 07:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc somehow he still looks like that


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
LOL


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
EVEN BLOO SAID IT WASN'T HIM LMAOOOOOO


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bloo: *doesnt age at all*


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If that was Bloo


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
lets put it this way


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
no matter how many tea videos people make


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He would definitely fit a role on Disney


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
it wont do anything major to the group


[15-May-20 07:50 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

NO ONE


[15-May-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000

[15-May-20 07:53 PM] emma;#1525
tbh


[15-May-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
or am i just being dumb


[15-May-20 07:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
should we announce to the mrs to not engage in the videos


[15-May-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
i told megan it was best not to


[15-May-20 07:54 PM] emma;#1525
i mean id be a hypocrite if i said i dont think MRs should ever comment on those posts (bc i did post that link) but like

[15-May-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah exactly


[15-May-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
she said she couldnt stay silent


[15-May-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and i don't think there's no turning back now of them commenting


[15-May-20 07:54 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah i asked him about it


[15-May-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525
that he still did do it


[15-May-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525
also the "photos" arent photoshopped


[15-May-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525
because it was a chat exploit


[15-May-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525
not photoshop


[15-May-20 07:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
OHHHH


[15-May-20 07:55 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[15-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525
and bringing a SB server into it


[15-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525

Where did I mention SB


[15-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525
just that you went to a SB private server to test the chat


[15-May-20 07:56 PM] emma;#1525

[15-May-20 07:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809

For "owning a group that stole Hilton models"


[15-May-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-May-20 07:57 PM] bonnie591#0591

[15-May-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) That is reaaaally easy to recreate


[15-May-20 07:57 PM] emma;#1525
wow thanks for asking to use my DMs in this doc.... y'all were gonna upload it without asking me 😂


[15-May-20 07:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
B) Baby and Bear said it was literally a bench and a mesh sooo


[15-May-20 07:58 PM] emma;#1525

Tremma

This is a JOKE please don't take it seriously lmao. I don't support online dating, but Trey is one of my good friends so I feel comfortable joking about Tremma.

[15-May-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I was trying to prove that but I guess that backfired


[15-May-20 08:00 PM] emma;#1525
just giving them more "proof" to analyze


[15-May-20 08:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[15-May-20 08:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Did the bman doxxing thing have anything to do with this vid or was it something else?


[15-May-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
because wearing beats headphones for 5 hours is a bad idea i guess


[15-May-20 08:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Something else


[15-May-20 08:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think it was something else


[15-May-20 08:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think Meme was behind it??


[15-May-20 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Kk


[15-May-20 08:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but i dont think he would want to be mentioned in the doc if hes worried about being doxxed


[15-May-20 08:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He said somebody mentioned his full name, and state


[15-May-20 08:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hang on wait a moment


[15-May-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so I found sort of hint towards it but I don't think it gives it away @Cooqkie


[15-May-20 08:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
towards bman?


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman one time mentioned the DMV and I think they ended up finding up by googling it


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
ok i read the whole doc


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
yeah we cannot post that lol


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but theres a dmv in every state?


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
attacking cinder and meow makes us just as bad as them


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] emma;#1525
not enough people care about that stupid video or believe it to make me concerned about defending ourselves from it


[15-May-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Look up DMV in urban dictionary


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then you'll see the states


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think they got that and proceeded to guess one of them to scare him


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i thought u meant like


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] emma;#1525
bman wouldnt be scared of them guessing 10 states lol that would show they don tknow


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the driving moter vehicles place


[15-May-20 08:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma the DMV is 3 lol


[15-May-20 08:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or that too @Cooqkie


[15-May-20 08:06 PM] emma;#1525
ok then bman shouldnt have said DMV and not expect people to have a good guess of where he lives


[15-May-20 08:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Rip


[15-May-20 08:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm just hoping he's going to be aight in the next few months

[15-May-20 08:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i miss beanman DDD:


[15-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525
as far as for how they got bman's name, its actually extremely hard to "dox" people with no prior information so I'd guess that bman used to trust someone and prob told them a bit too much and that person turned on him


[15-May-20 08:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm deadass worried about my homie no cap 😤


[15-May-20 08:07 PM] emma;#1525

[16-May-20 01:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I joined and my volume was super loud and someone was singing


[16-May-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you made the channel wrong but I fixed it


[16-May-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
@Cam you’re gonna have to immure people manually


[16-May-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
I mute


[16-May-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
UNMUTE


[16-May-20 01:08 PM] emma;#1525
Bc minn set the perms wrong


[16-May-20 01:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[16-May-20 01:10 PM] Cam#5887
@emma;


[16-May-20 01:10 PM] emma;#1525
It prob won’t work for people already in the VC


[16-May-20 01:10 PM] Cam#5887
they arent muted on my side


[16-May-20 01:10 PM] Cam#5887
meaning they have to unmute


[16-May-20 01:10 PM] emma;#1525
but it should work for people who join in now


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; people cant unmute


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
that’s the pointtt


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887
but


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887
i cant unmute them


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887
thats the issue


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
then how are they going to sing


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887
on my side


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887
i cant unmute them


[16-May-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887
they are muted


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
pretty sure i said for nobody to change permissions


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
min


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u legit let


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
unverified ppl


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
chat


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and then they were cursing


[16-May-20 01:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and it was chaotic


[16-May-20 01:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
**were**


[16-May-20 01:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
an event is never going to be perfect


[16-May-20 01:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
the point is they're not anymore


[16-May-20 01:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
thats just like someone strolling in general and starting swearing


[16-May-20 01:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
ok i fixed the VC channel


[16-May-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
@xM_inn


[16-May-20 01:15 PM] Cam#5887
all set to go?


[16-May-20 01:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
mhm


[16-May-20 01:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
it was working fine the way it was despite for the few people unmuting who were banned, now nobody cant speak at all


[16-May-20 01:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
the permissions were the way they were for a reason


[16-May-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; stop


[16-May-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
changing


[16-May-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
permissions


[16-May-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
literally not gonna ask again


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you didn’t ask once lol I was getting DMs that people were being rude and disrupting


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
it works if you set it up right the first time


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
it was working the way it was


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no it wasnt min


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
we banned people who violated the rules


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
clearly not if I was getting so many complaints


[16-May-20 01:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the majority of rule breakers **werent verified** or **didnt have the talkative role**


[16-May-20 01:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
and now people cant see the new VC that i just made


[16-May-20 01:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
because an HR messed with the permissions AGAIN when i said not to


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
Lol minn whatever you did kicked a bunch of people


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
also I didn’t see you ask not to change perms soz


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
so now we're back at where we started, so the 15 minutes we just spent changing permissions was just pointless, nobody change the permissions from now, it's just hurting the event.


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
You set it up differently than we ALWAYS do so I assumed it was a mistake


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
i said it here


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
and in the server


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
It wasn’t 15 mins it was 5 chill


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
And look now people are in muting and interrupting


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
no 10 minutes ok!


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
Unmuting


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
just ban people who do that


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
we cant fix that


[16-May-20 01:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause discord permissions are weird


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
as we've seen


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but min


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u set


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
permissions


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
for everyone


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
not the individual roles


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
because its an event for everyone


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
It’s always worked for me lol


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so then the unverified ppl were chatting and earraping and cursing


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
Q&As always worked


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
emma thats when we dont want people to unmute at all


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
but certain people need to be able to unmute


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
No I unmute certain people still


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
for when they sing


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] emma;#1525
during them


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
welp


[16-May-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we start changing permissions around again now people are gonna get annoyed and leave


[16-May-20 01:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
so let's just leave it the way it is, since it's working despite the few people unmuting


[16-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
I had to change them again Bc whatever you did kicked a bunch of staff


[16-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[16-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
But it should be working now

[16-May-20 10:47 PM] stacey#1000
So opinions, do yall want to just fire her or allow her to keep wasting her time and never promote her?


[16-May-20 10:47 PM] Cam#5887
waste her time


[16-May-20 10:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Waste her time


[16-May-20 10:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
its the same story as alloe


[16-May-20 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
Because 1. If we fire her they will know there is a spy on the server and I won't get information out of them anymore.


[16-May-20 10:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but this is a more confirmed one


[16-May-20 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
And 2. Easy way is to never promote her.


[16-May-20 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
Okay so just never promote her


[16-May-20 10:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@Bloo_Berriez was there ever an announcement on it


[17-May-20 03:34 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
there probably was but I told her to be more lenient on them so hopefully she’s not as strict as she was with them before

[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
just saying


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
their cameras are on


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
and


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
the top one i think


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
is showing their face from time to time


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
if they complain about their face being doxxed


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] Cooqkie#2809
its their fault for showing it on a public vc


[17-May-20 10:55 AM] stacey#1000

moody said it was in a vc


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
she left the vc


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so idk


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
take it anyway?


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@stacey


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] stacey#1000
Uh


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] stacey#1000
I mean without evidence there is really much we can do


[17-May-20 10:58 AM] stacey#1000
But was this in public vc?


[17-May-20 10:59 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[17-May-20 10:59 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think one of ours


[17-May-20 11:01 AM] stacey#1000
If moody wasn’t actually the one that witnessed it and someone told him and there is no evidence I would say no


[17-May-20 11:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but if moody heard it take it right?


[17-May-20 11:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[17-May-20 11:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
k


[17-May-20 11:02 AM] stacey#1000
But if it’s just someone random telling him I would say no


[17-May-20 11:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[17-May-20 11:03 AM] stacey#1000
Because it could be a case of someone doesn’t like her and is just trying to get her punished for nothing


[17-May-20 11:03 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[17-May-20 11:09 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@stacey he said bts and clarity heard her say it


[17-May-20 11:10 AM] stacey#1000
o


[17-May-20 11:10 AM] stacey#1000
If you want to take her role you can your choice

[17-May-20 06:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this shit is crazyyyy


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
acc sharing was reported to me and omg im so mad


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
acc sharing is the worst leaking you can do


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
no questioning needed with valid proof of her acc sharing


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
acc sharing and cyberbullying?


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
yep


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uhh


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
bye bye to her


[17-May-20 06:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
:cringe:


[17-May-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she has to go im sorry


[17-May-20 06:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well I automatically see account sharing and that’s automatic termination in my head lol


[17-May-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no doubt


[17-May-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that spells out them possibly leaking and probably abusing on their account


[17-May-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
she got kellys IP address too


[17-May-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
o-o


[17-May-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
kelly reports acc sharing to me= bye bye ella


[17-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
cyberbullying= double bye bye


[17-May-20 06:18 PM] Cam#5887
question, i’ve never terminated an MR so can i do it lol


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] Cam#5887
never done it before


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
YES CAM


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] Cam#5887
WOO


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
YOUR TURN


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] Cam#5887
yesyes


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] Cam#5887
so, when the votes concluded


[17-May-20 06:19 PM] Cam#5887
i should make a message


[17-May-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
OK


[17-May-20 06:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok*


[17-May-20 06:49 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey @Cam has anyone actually asked Ella about the account sharing yet


[17-May-20 06:50 PM] emma;#1525
I mean the proof looks legit but we should get into the habit of talking to people and not just terminating right off the bat given the few false terms we’ve had lol


[17-May-20 06:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i really don't know if this is false but i'll speak with her


[17-May-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the only issue is


[17-May-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kelly wants to remain anonymous


[17-May-20 06:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also uhh

but i'd look into the full context at this point


[17-May-20 07:33 PM] katie#0200
i also have a feeling that a4vi is dais because every time we find her account a new one suddenly appears and speaks to the same people


[17-May-20 07:33 PM] katie#0200
although I can’t assume


[17-May-20 07:34 PM] katie#0200
and i can’t rlly prove that, I’d just like to make u guys aware of my initial thought of that user


[17-May-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
this behavior is not ok fam


[17-May-20 07:34 PM] katie#0200
mhm


[17-May-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000

[17-May-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
-


[17-May-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[17-May-20 07:35 PM] katie#0200

[17-May-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000

[17-May-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
are you serious


[17-May-20 07:35 PM] katie#0200
Yes min made an announcement earlier if I’m not wrong


[17-May-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
@Cooqkie


[17-May-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000

[17-May-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000

[17-May-20 07:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll look at it


[17-May-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
i say ban kenzi and trisha from the discord


[17-May-20 07:37 PM] katie#0200
Wait @xM_inn I just read ur past announcement wrong I think u misunderstood what santia said


[17-May-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
for trash talking


[17-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
please show me the announcement if you can @katie


[17-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
see like


[17-May-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the first few screenshots are from somewhere else


[17-May-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's no doubt in my mind she deserves the role taken


[17-May-20 07:38 PM] katie#0200
Min thought that james admitted to being both users, but that’s not the case, let me just take screenshots of the proof that santa sent to min and i about this whole thing

or trey can do it


[17-May-20 07:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she has no business threatening people in this manner


[17-May-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
she should be banned from the discord if u ask me-


[17-May-20 07:40 PM] emma;#1525
you're gonna ban kenzi for saying 2 things lol


[17-May-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
no


[17-May-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000

[17-May-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000

[17-May-20 07:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809

kenzi needs to get a grip


[17-May-20 08:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm just not going to respond


[17-May-20 08:32 PM] katie#0200
her behaviour wasn’t acceptable so that’s just karma


[17-May-20 08:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Really disappointing to see herself portrayed this way


[17-May-20 08:32 PM] katie#0200
yup


[17-May-20 08:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Rip


[17-May-20 08:33 PM] stacey#1000
any update on ella


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] stacey#1000
she has 5 votes


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so I talked to her about attacking Lauren


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She basically was pissed because the qz's kicked her off the GC


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] stacey#1000
what about the acc sharing


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She even admitted those things should've been said soooo


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm actually talking to her about it now


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[17-May-20 08:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm just waiting for her to respond


[17-May-20 08:35 PM] stacey#1000
she probably knows shes screwed now


[17-May-20 08:35 PM] stacey#1000
acc sharing is the WORST form of leaking you can do


[17-May-20 08:35 PM] stacey#1000
like fr


[17-May-20 08:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oof i really don't like this idea


[17-May-20 08:48 PM] emma;#1525
why exactly


[17-May-20 08:48 PM] ethan;#0003
ive never gotten a report


[17-May-20 08:48 PM] ethan;#0003
of an lr with a bad guide


[17-May-20 08:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
they dont come in reports it comes in MRs complaining all the time lmao


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
i havent really noticed it as an issue tbh


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
also even if LRs are successfully training it reflects poorly on us anyways


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
because it's unprofessional af


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
and it's risky


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'd rather have the lr receive experience than nothing at all


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
i see it as a good way to see if an LR is worthy of a promotion as well


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
there's no reason for LRs to train if we have MRs who can fill in


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
also people are biased AF with which LRs train


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
it's usually the same people every time


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but what if we don't really


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
managers might feel overwhelmed if they have to train


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] ethan;#0003
lrs only train when there arent enough mrs...


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
instead of giving other people a chance


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] ethan;#0003
LR's dont get chosen if there are enough heads


[17-May-20 08:49 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; I never see managers stepping up to train lol


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe talk to them about this?


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
I don't let my managers train


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
managers are perfectly capable of training... its not overwhelming i did it all the time as a manager


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] a. ღ#4222
i agree and disagree , like sometimes some lrs dont know waht they are doing but other times its fine.. and a lot of the time in the servers i am in there are enough heads


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im sorry but i dont really like this idea


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
if there's enough heads it's not an issue anyways story lol


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
How are we supposed to know if someone is capable of being an MR if they can't train


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
i think the real issue is we don't have enough MRs


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
i mean we're a 1m group and we have like


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
30 heads


[17-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
maybe


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we have 130 something mrs in total


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
if u want another mr


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; training isn't a requirement to get MR.... plenty get MR without training...


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] emma;#1525
next


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
i can promote one rn if someone gives me my last vote


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
but also


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll look at it


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
we have training guides provided to people


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but only with my own thoughts about it


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
for a reason


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't wanna rush too quickly into it


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey having 130 MRs means jack shit if y'all dont want anyone but our 30 heads to train lmao


[17-May-20 08:51 PM] ethan;#0003
The problem would be fixed if there was a generalized training guide made by the HR's for all ranks to use like the old one on the group wall


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
we do have a generalized training guide


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
and its still a problem


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
trey made 4 training guides


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
but we can't require people to be in the discord


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
so not ever LR has it


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no i didn't-


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
I haven't noticed this issue at all tbh


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
you made at least one


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bliss and minn created the rest


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
MRs were legit just complaining about it in SL


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
ok here is an example I noticed


[17-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well let's just make new ones then


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
iiGrayCatii trained yesterday on my server, shes a rank 7


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
had a great guide


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
If we can get baby to update that thing he put on the group wall, i think that would fix the problem


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
and now she needs 1 more vote for a promotion


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i can get writing and test out if it doesn't cut out the messages


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] emma;#1525
im not saying all LRs suck at training (i even said they can train if there are not enough managers or heads) but it's not worth the risk of LRs **not** having good guides and giving out bad info and making us look bad


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] a. ღ#4222
if anything we should ask the mrs because they probably experience this morethan us


[17-May-20 08:53 PM] emma;#1525
LRs also have NOT gone through the training like MRs have


[17-May-20 08:54 PM] emma;#1525
i mean I hope y'all have training rules in your promo to MR guides


[17-May-20 08:54 PM] emma;#1525
but LRs dont get that information


[17-May-20 08:54 PM] emma;#1525
so they don't know all of the rules anyways as far as what they are supposed to be doing


[17-May-20 08:54 PM] emma;#1525
its sheer luck if they do it right


[17-May-20 08:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you have a point


[17-May-20 08:54 PM] emma;#1525
again we're a 1m group and yet we don't have the manpower to even train our trainees properly, we have to rely on LRs


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's not really a bad thing


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
obviously we need LRs to keep training *now* because it's impossible to have enough heads all the time


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
but I think we need to really start paying attention to promotion suggestions more


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
and voting faster


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the best thing i can do is go to both more


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
because some people are up for weeks


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
id be interested to know what the MRs think about letting LRs train honestly


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
i really dont know if they like it or not, im sure some do and some dont


[17-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do you just wanna take a vote and see what happens


[17-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i might just for fun


[17-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
bc it affects them more than us


[17-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
anyways


[17-May-20 08:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
erm i don't know about that


[17-May-20 08:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's see what they say first


[17-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey literally 90% of the choices we make affects MRs more than us


[17-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
but ok


[17-May-20 08:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
how do you know that exactly


[17-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think it makes more sense to see what their perspective is on this


[17-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait hold on


[17-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can take a strawpoll just for fun, then proceed to have them discuss it in staff discussion


[17-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it can either be optional or mandatory of your choice


[17-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
i mean think about it


[17-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
what things have we been discussing recently


[17-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
as far as rule changes go


[17-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
breaks - wouldn't let MRs ask staff to go back to work, MRs are the only ranks required to do shifts so that mainly falls on them


[17-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
being lenient in interviews - only affects MRs


[17-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
anything about the application board - mainly affects seniors bc they do the *brunt* of the reviewing (ya we do some to but we mainly rank and that doesnt change lol)


[17-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
anything about hotel procedure - again HRs arent required to go to the hotel so that leaves MRs to do the majority of work dealing with it


[17-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
lol well they all like letting LRs train so ig its not an issue but i still stand with my opinion of we should have enough MRs where it's rarely as much of a need as it is now anyways


[17-May-20 09:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well this is what i noticed for a majority of them


[17-May-20 09:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
a lot of them can be accounts hiding themselves of previous punishments, previous issues, and much more


[17-May-20 09:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i noticed that bman and i had to archive aaaaaaaaaalot of cards


[17-May-20 09:04 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey as far as what


[17-May-20 09:04 PM] emma;#1525
i listed a bunch of stuff


[17-May-20 09:04 PM] emma;#1525
so you need to be specific if you're referencing one of them


[17-May-20 09:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So this is a couple of themes I saw from the cards


[17-May-20 09:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So one was ench9nting, y'all know why


[17-May-20 09:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then there was omar, y'all know why too


[17-May-20 09:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the guide on the information on the group is outdated right?


[17-May-20 09:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Or is it still useable


[17-May-20 09:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause if not we should add one of the guides y’all made


[17-May-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Most of it is usable


[17-May-20 09:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Didn’t you guys make a new one though few of you did


[17-May-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But it's missing info of cookies and stuff from the new update


[17-May-20 09:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ohh


[17-May-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then there was Addie, this was pretty obvious lol


[17-May-20 09:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Well if we add that we should ask baby to update it. I mean I don’t think that one we have up has been touched in a year


[17-May-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Some of the picks have really bad reputations


[17-May-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And trust me, I commented some of them

[18-May-20 12:47 AM] Cam#5887
Dear, auellaaa.

The HR team has been reviewing past activity on your account, and we have deemed necessary to **terminate** your position as 9 | Head of Services due to account sharing and cyberbullying users of the MR team. As you are well aware, this behavior is a violation towards the Bloxton guidelines, and is not tolerated as an MR at Bloxton.

Thank you for dedicating your time to Bloxton.

Sincerely,
**cam_s**
**Shift Manager**


[18-May-20 12:47 AM] Cam#5887
pretty shitty but


[18-May-20 12:47 AM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 12:47 AM] Cam#5887
im not either tbh


[18-May-20 12:47 AM] Cam#5887
what could spice it up


[18-May-20 12:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so change up completing an analysis on you


[18-May-20 12:48 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[18-May-20 12:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
that sounds like we're watching her every move lol


[18-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
How-


[18-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525
Trey you are a special human


[18-May-20 12:48 AM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 12:48 AM] Cam#5887
?


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"completing an analysis"


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] emma;#1525
“We have also considered the fact that0


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] emma;#1525
That’s awkward


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] Cam#5887
aaaaaaa


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] Cam#5887
I SUCK AT LETTERS OKAY?


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] Cam#5887
goddamnnnn


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
nah it's ok


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] emma;#1525
I would just say “As you are aware, this behavior is...”


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's your first time lol


[18-May-20 12:49 AM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 12:50 AM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 12:50 AM] Cam#5887
lemme add something


[18-May-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"All of this behavior is completely unacceptable."


[18-May-20 12:50 AM] emma;#1525
I would still say “as you are aware” just helps show that they are being fired for their own choices


[18-May-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
o


[18-May-20 12:50 AM] Cam#5887

and send her that letter


[18-May-20 12:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait i can make this better


[18-May-20 12:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"As you are aware, all of this behavior is completely unacceptable and is not tolerated as an MR at Bloxton."


[18-May-20 12:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
so change it to this


[18-May-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 12:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"As you are well aware, this behavior is a violation towards the Bloxton guidelines, and is not tolerated as an MR at Bloxton."


[18-May-20 12:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
we should probably decide whether to let her stay on the discord or not


[18-May-20 12:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause these are two major offenses she committed


[18-May-20 12:58 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[18-May-20 12:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
account sharing and talking shit to a co-worker?


[18-May-20 12:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
those are really dangerous


[18-May-20 12:58 AM] Cam#5887
she cyberbullied so i say to ban


[18-May-20 12:58 AM] Cam#5887
cause like


[18-May-20 12:58 AM] Cam#5887
god only knows what shes going/who shes going to talk bad to or about


[18-May-20 12:59 AM] Cam#5887
message has been sent


[18-May-20 01:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 02:47 AM] emma;#1525

theres just 34 pending reports


[18-May-20 08:13 PM] xM_inn#2821

[18-May-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 08:13 PM] xM_inn#2821

[18-May-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what if


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we split the accepted reports to suspension and firing


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah ok


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
one section can be suspensions


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
i take one list, u take the other?


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
once we've split 'em


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
another can be firings


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that way, we don't have to do the cards one-by-one


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
kk lets organize the reports first, then we'll move both lists to the HR board


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes sir


[18-May-20 08:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@xAfroTrey normally i'd suspend for this but the person literally spammed the group wall with it, fire? https://trello.com/c/pDonUY0N/195961-fxizzi-security-advertising-on-group-wall

okay just wanted a second opinion


[18-May-20 08:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if it involves bloxton of them spamming on purpose that should be a fire

[18-May-20 08:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
personally im waiting until there is a break system in the game


[18-May-20 08:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 08:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

alright well imma just archive this cause what the guy is doing is just harmless and it seems harsh to suspend or even warn for that matter

[18-May-20 08:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i agree


[18-May-20 08:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
mhm, lmk what u think but the evidence is pretty poor based on what they're being accused of


[18-May-20 08:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
okie


[18-May-20 08:27 PM] ethan;#0003

[18-May-20 08:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was causing drama at the tc


[18-May-20 08:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
i personally think warning cause like they're using grammar and stuff


[18-May-20 08:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh


[18-May-20 08:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it was about the tea video too so 💀

i'll post it in


[18-May-20 08:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
do we have proof cause if so lets add that to the report and transfer

Okay yeah that's unnecessary


[18-May-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's make that a suspension then with the additional proof


[18-May-20 08:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ehhh i kind of disagree lol


[18-May-20 08:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
He obviously needs to take time to reconsider how he values his job and his actions


[18-May-20 08:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
What do u think?


[18-May-20 08:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 08:31 PM] xM_inn#2821

[18-May-20 08:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he also give the video attention sooo


[18-May-20 08:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's a fire for me since there's that and the evidence posted now @xM_inn


[18-May-20 08:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well that's bypassed on roblox if I'm not wrong so I guess we can fire


[18-May-20 08:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's two offenses he got there


[18-May-20 08:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 08:32 PM] xM_inn#2821

[18-May-20 08:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
sure


[18-May-20 08:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
@xAfroTrey i liked that, worked well. imma do that next time i do reports too.


[18-May-20 08:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait so i have an idea


[18-May-20 08:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can do the current plan


[18-May-20 08:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
rank them to what their punishment is


[18-May-20 08:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then move it to accepted


[18-May-20 08:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
once the suspension requests is taken care of and moved to the section of it being accepted, we can move all the cards on the list to the hr board


[18-May-20 08:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
we could, i personally prefer just doing all the ranking once they're on the HR board but up to u, your preference when reviewing reports sooo whatever u feel is better for u


[18-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez im confused on the senior checklists


[18-May-20 08:50 PM] emma;#1525
did you like uncheck some people's things and then recheck them but do it BEFORE you put their total up


[18-May-20 08:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
BEAR


[18-May-20 08:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
@High Rank #hr-announcements 
If you all enjoy this im going to post it


[18-May-20 08:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
do they lose their staff tools during the breaks?


[18-May-20 08:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
Break system information


[18-May-20 08:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok


[18-May-20 08:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie Currently not thinking but what do you think?


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
what if they are on break but an exploiter shows up and they dont have the cuffs


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ye


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
depends what u wanna do?


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
remove or na


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Hmmm


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i say for security


[18-May-20 08:53 PM] Tattoblue#5828
maybe


[18-May-20 08:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I mean for the last thing u put do u mean they shouldn’t be using the handcuffs while on break?


[18-May-20 08:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i like most of it but i disagree with the no time limit rule still


[18-May-20 08:54 PM] ethan;#0003
will they be required to use grammar while on break @Beartikal


[18-May-20 08:54 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal lemme just say i would NOT announce this until you actually want it to go into effect


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
bc people will assume the announcement means its happening NOW


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he did say "if you all enjoy this"


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont enjoy it


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but some ppl aren’t gonna know what that means


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but if its implemented then i cant say much


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think the breaks should be timed tho?


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] emma;#1525
i dont enjoy unlimited breaks BUT ya know we lost that battle


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i think breaks should be timed


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Same


[18-May-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
same here


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
wait wait wait


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal will having a break take their staff tools away


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
depends what you guys want to od


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
i dont like security not having access to cuffs on break... for the exact reasons you stated in that rule


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
like they should have them if needed


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
if theres a function


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that would be a good idea


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Is there a way to


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think staff need like housekeping tools


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
that removes their security tools


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
i never said they would be removed


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
but we should at least keep cuffs


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Remove all tools except handcuffs?


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
Ok


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can dop that


[18-May-20 08:56 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal that rule makes it seem like its going to be


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; which one i can fix it


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
though they can still report it if it happens


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
-What if I’m a security and I’m on break, but there’s an exploiter??
    First, check for other users that are security and on-duty. If not – try to turn the break off if it is not on cooldown. If you cannot turn off the break, alert an MR about the situation or submit a report explaining the situation of the exploiter and about your inability to disable break at this time.


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] emma;#1525
to me that seems like as a security you wont have cuffs and thats why you need to NOT be on break OR get an MR


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya same


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Kinda confusing


[18-May-20 08:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
@PackItUpMack if im a staff and i dont want to work what do you think i would do?
The answer: I would leave the game. If they aren't working and they aren't playing the game isn't that the same thing?

With no time, i would now stay in the game and be able to switch between playing and working.


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
i mean a bunch of staff in a game on break prevents staff who actually WANT to work from being in the server


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
but ya know o well ig!! all in the name of unlimited breaks 😄


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
theres new servers


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
nahh


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think that the breaks should be timed? Like 10-15 mins?


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
yeah staff hate being the only one on a server


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
plus its automated


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like the idea of it being unlimited


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok time to go on break unlimited at the hotel


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
idk why we're starting with unlimited


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
that seems extreme


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
10 sounds like the perfect time length


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wait what is unlimited for


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
i feel like starting with 10-15 mins and increasing it after we know it works


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
is like


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
the smarter move


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] emma;#1525
personally


[18-May-20 08:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The duration of the break or how many breaks they can take?


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
both cookie


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal is there a cooldown for both going on and off breaks


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
or just for turning your break off


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
wait jk


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
you answered that


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
disregard


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] emma;#1525
i cant read


[18-May-20 08:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
They should be able to take as many breaks as they want if there’s a break cool down Bc if someone is at the hotel for like 2 hours compared to 30 mins then they should get more breaks


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; i said that because the MRs said you shouldnt be able to report when on duty so thats why i worded the last one that way


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
you shouldn't be able to report when... ON... duty?


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
they really said that??


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
off*


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
ohhh ok


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
that makes more sense lol


[18-May-20 09:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
so ill reword it


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut wut


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
also, i really think we should keep it unlimited time first as it feels like a prison if theres a timer constantly ticking in my face idk guysssss


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u mean if they aren’t working they can’t report ppl and guests?


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
yes cookie


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
huh


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
thats apparently what the MRs wanted


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie can, if its an emergency


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but guests can report people too??


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
bc they think people will just never work and sit there and report


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
and not do anything else


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk that doesn’t rly make sense to me


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think gusts have talking perms in the reports channels


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
blame the MRs


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
do they??


[18-May-20 09:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Talkative can report I think


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
o i guess they can


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
they just dont very often


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
i mean i get where the MRs are coming from


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
but i feel like if someone's on break and they notice an issue


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
they should be able to report it


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk it doesn’t rly make sense to me if guests and report and off duty staff can’t


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
we shouldn't treat afk report farming as a problem until it is one


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
bc i doubt many people would do it


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Who knows how many reports MRs get from guests


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And then the MR report it


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And u don’t know it’s from a guest ya know


[18-May-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
the ones who do reports a lot are the ones thirsty for promos and they'll keep working a lot anyways lol


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
sooooo.. unlimited timer?


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
none of us like it but ur gonna do it anyways 😂


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
no D:


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
its gonna feel like a prison cell


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
if theres a clock


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg I got idea


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey freshcurry wants to know why he was suspended for this https://i.imgur.com/SUvOZy8.png it looks like it should only be a warning

[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
How about


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
actually prison cells dont have clocks in them


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
When u start ur break it says how much time u HABE


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Have*


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
jk i have no idea


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And then


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The timer goes away


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
what if you get like


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No it shouldn't


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
a 5 min warning


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Comes back when ur break is 5 mins away from ending


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
that pops up for a few seconds


[18-May-20 09:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So then u don’t see it the whole time


[18-May-20 09:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
but its still timed tho


[18-May-20 09:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but u said seeing the timer makes u stress


[18-May-20 09:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they abuse breaks to the 5 minute mark they rlly dont wanan work


[18-May-20 09:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So if they don’t see the timer then no stress?


[18-May-20 09:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats true


[18-May-20 09:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
but overall more than anything i like unlimited time for the fact that as a staff you're free to go back to rank 1 in a way for as long as you want.


[18-May-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
i mean weve never had problems without breaks, as you said if people dont wanna work they can just leave lol so i feel like implementing an UNLIMITED timer is trying to solve a "problem" we dont necessarily... have....? if you get me


[18-May-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
a bunch of LRs and MRs have private servers anyways if they want to use the hotel freely


[18-May-20 09:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Unlimited seems like it's too much


[18-May-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
so it's not really necessary to give them unlimited breaks when they have other options for using the hotel, and a break is meant to be just that.... a break... not a vacation 😂


[18-May-20 09:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya I agree with Emma


[18-May-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's actually a perfect argument


[18-May-20 09:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
this is my logic:
**staff need break**
with breaks:
Break on --> No Time --> I play game and have fun
without:
No break system --> Leave game, come back later to work.

With an unlimited timer they can play the game as it should be played without fear of being fired and having to leave, furthermore it also increases player count.


[18-May-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal im gonna be 100% real, if you and baby are planning on doing unlimited breaks NO MATTER WHAT WE SAY then stop asking for our opinion because it's really annoying to fight for something that you aren't going to let us do anyways


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
like it's literally up to you guys and we'll do whatever you make us either way


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
im negotiating


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
can i not do that


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I agree with Emma saying it’s a break not a vacation


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No you can


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
how is this negotiating


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
when all you've said is "unlimited breaks"


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
im trying to reason


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
no matter what


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We just disagree with the concept atm


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
you're trying to convince us you are right


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
that's fair but different than negotiating


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
"not a vacation" is not a valid argument


[18-May-20 09:07 PM] emma;#1525
neither is "its a prison" tf no one's ever said that 😂


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I mean if they’re on break the whole time it’s basically a vacation


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
my solution has provided maximum player count and not a fear of being fired and not having MRs "bark" around LRs all day

what has yours provided


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
i mean

WE DONT FIRE LRS FOR INACTIVITY


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg bear I think u should add mini golf to the hotel (Ik that way off topic but whatever)


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
rlly


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but the idea it's in is wayyy too  vulnerable


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
No you fire them for not working


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No we don't lol


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] emma;#1525
no we dont lmao


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] ethan;#0003
this weekend might be the memorial day sale 😍


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
then why do they go


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] emma;#1525
they can stand in the break room all they want


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
"to your stations"


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They face either a suspension or warning lol


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
"back t owork"


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What sale


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal you should put gamepasses on sale for memorial day


[18-May-20 09:08 PM] emma;#1525
because MRs have authority to ask LRs to work


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
until you take it away form them


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
not anymore


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
they should


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal can u add mini golf to v7


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
ik you dont care about MRs but wow they're really gonna suffer from that lol


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
imagine trying to moderate a server you have 0 control over ☠️


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
id just not go


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
tbh


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The MRs are gonna hate unlimited timers for breaks


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that's the problem


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
its not moderating its like little prisoners going "hey go back to your cell"


[18-May-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
not worth the mental stress


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
moderating = exploiters, trollers, NOT staff


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal you saying its a prison is as WRONG as us saying "its a vacation"


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] emma;#1525
so please stop


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] emma;#1525
because you're being a hypocrite lol


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@xM_inn idk who that even is ive never seen them before lol


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] emma;#1525
its not a prison, literally NEVER hear that complaint


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uhh no


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Staff too


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Just saying that seems kind of ignorant


[18-May-20 09:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
why should they work if they dont want to its so dumb to enforce a staff who refuses to work
i mean, if they dont want to work = No promotion? Why bark at them


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I get it but why are they training in the first place


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For a job


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] emma;#1525
^^ lol


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey to play and work


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
not to just work


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If we make the breaks unlimited, then that destroys the purpose lol


[18-May-20 09:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but that would just kill the balance


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal i'd like to repeat my point that if you're going to not even negotiate and just try to convince us you're right TELL US THAT so we can shut up and stop pretending you're gonna do a timed break because it's what all of us want


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] emma;#1525
i'm soooooo over you doing this bear lol this is the second time we've done this circus dance now


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] emma;#1525
and i have a good feeling you arent gonna budge at all


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe they can only go on break for 15 minutes every 60 minutes?


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
like a script that does that


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
I get it but why are they training in the first place
For a job

^^
To enjoy the hotel as a staff -that doesn't mean all staff want to climb the ladder to an HR position


[18-May-20 09:12 PM] emma;#1525
no thats a prison bc its timed ethan!


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah but that defeats the purpose of receiving a position in the first place


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's going to make reports really messy and confusing


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
ok im done with this convo y'all we aren't going to win at all bear's doing unlimited breaks whether we (as the ones who run the physical hotel most of the time) and the MRs (who deal with staff and trollers etc the MOST and will be most affected by this) like it or NOT


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
bye im not doing this again lmaooooo so done


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok then dont interact with this conversation


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but I really hate the concept you're putting it in


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
dont ask our opinions if ur not gonna listen im not here to be convinced


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
bad management


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bear why did you ask us then lol


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
👎


[18-May-20 09:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
:thumbs_up:


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
"That's going to make reports really messy and confusing"
Then let staff able to report when on break as well


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
i have never liked that staff always get reported for going to the bar and getting food or they take out a room or swim in the pool


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal what about 15 mins breaks ever 20-30 mins


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Every*


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
See like


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cookie and Ethan have good ideas


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I see a lot pros than cons


[18-May-20 09:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just dont see why a timer what are you trying to enforce why is it timed whats the idea behind it


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] ethan;#0003
trey it seems like your totally against breaks in general


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats all i want answered


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
When the fuck did I say that ethan


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal can we try it with the timer and then see how it goes


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And if the timer goes well try it with no timer?


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And then pick whichever worked better


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
??


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal i think a timer would be better then unlimited because then the promotion hungry lrs will just be in game and show that they are in game not working just being on break trying to get noticed by an HR


[18-May-20 09:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not even against it, you're just twisting my words at this point.


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I literally said the same thing you two said.


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
@ethan; understandable but isnt that our role to pick out who is good and who is not


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think we should try timer and no timer each for a week and then whichever worked better is the one we do


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] ethan;#0003
i think we should just let him do it then we can discuss maybe asking bear to change it later down the line if it does get abused


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
there will always be bad people abusing breaks


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
even with a timer


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that's just going to make sessions more difficult to do without enough help.


[18-May-20 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who is “some” @emma; cause if you’re talking about Maddys card I only rechecked it because I wanted to make sure she has reached her 100 for week


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And god knows we're facing that right now.


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey by sessions what do you mean


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey breaks are for horel only


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] ethan;#0003
training sessions?


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
?


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
hotel?


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Actually, all three.


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
breaks are for hotel only btw


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This sounds like something that's going to aggravate the MRs and LRs alike.


[18-May-20 09:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
how so


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003
i think that there should be some poll


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I was going to say that.


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003
that the community votes on what they think should be put in


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] ethan;#0003
and the poll would have diffent options for breaks


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
That’s gonna be MRs vs MRs and hrs lol


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I mean


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Instead of us arguing, let's see what the community says.


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg LRs vs MRs and hrs


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Not MRs vs MRs oops


[18-May-20 09:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm pretty confident they'll pick the same thing we said.


[18-May-20 09:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The MRs or the LRs


[18-May-20 09:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Both.


[18-May-20 09:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ik majority MRs is gonna be timed and LRs will probs be split


[18-May-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
it should be for everyone to vote even guests


[18-May-20 09:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's what the Discord is for.


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
it should be a google poll so it is anonymous


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm.


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
discord polls are not accurate because they will see one emoji go higher and they will pick that


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
because they know the other one wont win


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can also pick grammar or no grammar in breaks.


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya do a google one


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know a lot of MRs reaaaallly hate the idea.


[18-May-20 09:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Discord breaks after like 5k reactions


[18-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
When lrs think no grammar they think they can be unprofessional


[18-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
so i dont think that is a good idea to even bring up to them


[18-May-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't want us to be a clone of SB.


[18-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
we dont sell ranks


[18-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
they do


[18-May-20 09:22 PM] ethan;#0003
difference


[18-May-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sure they have a lot of members, but they focus on quantity more than actual quality.


[18-May-20 09:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's a lot of things to like about the game, but I think the cons kind of weigh it down.


[18-May-20 09:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
lol

I think this is why the group doesn't grow as fast.


[18-May-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This man is so late 💀


[18-May-20 09:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Y was freshcurry13 suspended? He’s asking me and I’m on mobile so


[18-May-20 09:23 PM] ethan;#0003
he asked me too


[18-May-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He was suspended for discrimination lol


[18-May-20 09:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok ty


[18-May-20 09:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even if it was a joke, that looks reaallly bad on him


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] ethan;#0003
https://i.imgur.com/SektCbt.png i just think it should of been a warning in my opinion

[18-May-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nah I disagree


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What’s their history


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] ethan;#0003
nothing


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think anything atleast


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean the way that they put this in should've been way better thought out


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Well if it’s nothing then I think it should be a warning too lol


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not to me


[18-May-20 09:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think this was really irresponsible and kind of immature


[18-May-20 09:25 PM] ethan;#0003
trey he is just a kid he probally doesnt even know what gay means


[18-May-20 09:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
little kids say stuff all the time


[18-May-20 09:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think that really exempts him though


[18-May-20 09:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya but if he’s had a good history until now I think it’s kinda harsh suspending for this


[18-May-20 09:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they need to learn that its not ok to use gay as an insult


[18-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah they kind of used it that way


[18-May-20 09:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk for some ppl warnings scare the crap outa them


[18-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Giving them a warning seems like a slap on the wrist


[18-May-20 09:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like "yeah it's ok lol"


[18-May-20 09:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I guess


[18-May-20 09:27 PM] ethan;#0003
he didnt use it as an insult though


[18-May-20 09:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that’s kinda stupid to say


[18-May-20 09:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk I think it would be easier to judge if we had a chunk of the conversation instead of just that


[18-May-20 09:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"ITS WEIRD BEING GAY BOY AND EWWWWWWW"


[18-May-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh no fam 💀


[18-May-20 09:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that really does not sit well with me


[18-May-20 09:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
this kid is whack

@xAfroTrey do u have part of where he said that instead of just what he said


[18-May-20 09:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I’ve said it 5 times to him lol


[18-May-20 09:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc the “ewwww” part might have been for something else


[18-May-20 09:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it was in general discussion


[18-May-20 09:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[18-May-20 09:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oooof the lrs responded with backlash


[18-May-20 09:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O ok nvm lol


[18-May-20 09:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was talking about james charles but that's kind of similar to the bullying to lizzo

O


[18-May-20 09:32 PM] emma;#1525
she is a music artist who is pretty overweight and a lot of people make fun of her for it


[18-May-20 09:32 PM] emma;#1525

[18-May-20 09:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes I do last weeks and if they did anything today as in Monday I just mark it cause it’s not fair to  not mark it after they had done it already @emma;


[18-May-20 09:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i tried defending myself (if you can call it one) and it backfired soooo

[18-May-20 09:37 PM] emma;#1525
ethan has so much fun on this team


[18-May-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
changed a lot of them


[18-May-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
```
-It’s going to be abused!?
    If a user never turns off their break, this does NOT mean they are abusing the system, “abuse” in this context means to troll while on break, etc. A user can go on break as long as they’d like.

-What if they don’t ever go back to work?
    That is up the staff, if they decide to not work, then they do not have to. Breaks simply mean to play the game as a player, and if a staff doesn’t want to work, that is totally up to them.

-Reports? They are used to check activity, what if somebody just uses breaks to capture reports?
    We feel that regardless of the staff being on break, reporting still helps the hotel maintain moderation, and have decided to allow reporting while on break.

-What if I’m a security and I’m on break, but there’s an exploiter??
    Try to turn the break off if it is not on cooldown to return to work. If you cannot turn off the break, you can still submit a report explaining the situation about the exploiter.

-Do I keep staff tools on break?
    Yes, of course.

-Do I have to use grammar on break?
    Nope. When on break, you’re free from regular duties – go have fun! Note: Staff still cannot troll or show inappropriate behavior while on break.
```


[18-May-20 09:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
BEAR


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I have a question


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Or suggestion


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Or both


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] ethan;#0003
You should have next to their name in the chat box on the top left like "on break" or "off break" beacuse someone might not see a staff is on break and report them for not using grammar


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
If we want to check an LRs hotel activity if we want to promote them


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
They could just go right back to work


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
@ethan; k


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
can do htat


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal can you add a function where HRs can check how long someone's been on break in a game


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So what if u added a little thingy with an arrow that shows how long someones been on break


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] emma;#1525
for the reason cookie said


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] ethan;#0003
or maybe just like a green/red dot next to their name


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] ethan;#0003
O


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] ethan;#0003
i HAVE AN IDEA


[18-May-20 09:38 PM] ethan;#0003
at pablos


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
they have channels


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
in game


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's a great idea @emma;


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; i can add better logging in the game sure


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
for staff


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] emma;#1525
ok cool


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] emma;#1525
we love logs


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
panda has a system for that


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
where staff can talk to other staff in the game


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
u should add that


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like a radio?


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait so


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
kinda but a lot simpler


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let me come in the game so you know what i'm talking about


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] ethan;#0003
you just lick a button to switch from staff only chat to everyone chat


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Lick


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[18-May-20 09:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
is it the button thats at the top of the chat by Roblox


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] ethan;#0003

[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can do that


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] ethan;#0003
in pablos


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
yea


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
i know what u mean


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal also can you specifically say that staff are expected to work if they want promotions, they can of course take breaks but should still maintain a good work schedule *if* their goal is a promo


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg Ik what ur talking about


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] emma;#1525
bc a lot of people think its all about reports


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] emma;#1525
and if they can report on breas


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] emma;#1525
breaks


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; yes ok


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Is it that thing in UD in the chatbox with the tabs on top


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] emma;#1525
they might not work and still think they're getting promoted LOL


[18-May-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760

this was this week


[18-May-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
4 sessions isn't really a lot though in the 10 days she had to improve, also not to mention her excuse for being inactive for months prior was poor


[18-May-20 09:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
4 sessions seems kind of low


[18-May-20 09:50 PM] ethan;#0003
4 sessions is more then most hrs host...


[18-May-20 09:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that's because we're involved with more productive and executive decisions lmao


[18-May-20 09:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Her reporting isn't very impressive either and I have not seen her present at the hotel


[18-May-20 09:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
last piece


[18-May-20 09:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
```
Too long, didn’t read (TL;DR):

      New break system at hotel soon. When activated, there is a cooldown to disable it/ re-enable it. Breaks are not timed and can stay on as long as the user wants to keep it on. Staff on break = regular player. They do not have to use grammar, but must maintain professionality. Added so that staff can play Bloxton and enjoy the game as a guest. They keep tools on break, can submit reports. Staff are expected to work, however, to be selected to be promoted. Breaks add an option to play the game!
```


[18-May-20 09:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Love it. When do you plan on updating?


[18-May-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg omg bear I got another suggestion


[18-May-20 09:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
most of it is really good but i don't like the no grammar and unlimited rule still


[18-May-20 09:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
break = regular player

[18-May-20 09:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What if when they go back to work they get tped infront of the recep and housekeeping door


[18-May-20 09:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
i actually rlly like that idea


[18-May-20 09:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Can you move the house keeping to where the staff door is and move the staff door to the side


[18-May-20 09:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
and yes i got a lot of suggestions on that


[18-May-20 09:55 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya y is housekeeping always off to the side lol


[18-May-20 09:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do you have previews yet @Beartikal


[18-May-20 09:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ye someone edited it and made a draft it looked much cooler


[18-May-20 09:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey not yet


[18-May-20 09:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
@RAMMGaming id actualyl like to see that draft


[18-May-20 09:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I liked how it was in V3 where the door was in the middle separating the recep and house desks


[18-May-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bro can we have an easter egg of a picture of us burning the pilgrim outfits @Beartikal


[18-May-20 09:58 PM] Beartikal#9760

Ik I saw that rn 🙄


[18-May-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
Ok legit


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
He does 1 thing a week JUST to keep his rant


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
He doesn’t host


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
He does either a 30 min in 1 week or like 30 applications


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly can we demote him for inactivity....?


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
WHY HIS ROLE GREEN


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
IT LOOKS LIKE THE BOD ROLE


[18-May-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
He literally doesn’t host


[18-May-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
ANYTHING


[18-May-20 10:14 PM] stacey#1000
He does 1 SMALL THING to keep his rank


[18-May-20 10:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
what i said on bmans card is we should wait until the end of the month and reassess him


[18-May-20 10:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause then if we demote, we have a stronger argument


[18-May-20 10:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
honestly though. like what‘a a few weeks any different from now.


[18-May-20 10:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it’s just annoying how he tells the whole world “only few more weeks until I resign” like you don’t see anyone else doing that


[18-May-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
He’s literally asking for attention


[18-May-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
He posted this in 2 servers

[18-May-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i really dislike it


[18-May-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wanna see what katie thinks


[18-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
He doesn’t deserve to resign on his own terms if he’s like this


[18-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly he doesn’t even contribute to the senior team


[18-May-20 10:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ooo swan asked for an appeal

[18-May-20 10:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I like that they didn’t make it flush with the rest of the wall


[18-May-20 10:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
It would look 2 flat if it was like that


[18-May-20 10:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
@RAMMGaming that picture proves that most servers dont have staff and thats why we have self check in

[18-May-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525

[18-May-20 11:09 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u can just disable tts


[18-May-20 11:09 PM] emma;#1525

you dont need administrator to do your job


[18-May-20 11:11 PM] emma;#1525
literally losing it because you dont like tts (when you can ask us not to use it and i'll listen its not even that fun after like 20 minutes) is stupid


[18-May-20 11:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 11:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the next thing you tell me is that trollers don't need kicking


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
Or can I just not see it


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
you just cant see it


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey baby and bear dont think we need administrator to do things on the discord channel


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
so now we cant talk in SL, manage MR channels, see half the HR channels, create new channels... etc


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
We need to be able to ban and appeal people from the discord


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
and for.. what?


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
a power trip


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
??


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
omg


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
im literally shaking this is so angering


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
i'll update the roles and permisions


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
this literally feels like you guys dont trust us with admin


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why did it take so long to convince you


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
not after what i've seen today


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
when we've NEVER abused (and tts does NOT count, bonnie started that and y'all never asked us to stop)


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
We also need to be able to announce stuff to people


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that was dumb as shit


[18-May-20 11:13 PM] emma;#1525
we are NOT children, ask us to stop something and we'll do it


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
going right into a "punishment" for something the MRs thought was FUNNY is literally so stupid


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887
i cant talk in SL


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887

[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887
whats going on


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what why am i punished


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Tattoblue#5828
if u give urselves the support role u can see tickets again


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i didn't even do anything lol


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
@Cam baby and bear took our tts because "i used tts and curse too much"


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
and we "dont need it to do our jobs"


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but can we do them @Tattoblue


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lol


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887
then just disable TTS


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] emma;#1525
admin overrides it BUT I LEGIT SAID I'D STOP IF THEY ASKED ME


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
wait our admin was taken?


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887
oh


[18-May-20 11:14 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
but apparently they dont respect me enough to ask me to stop before punishing everyone


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
trey


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
that is sooo


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
not needing to be brought up


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
he’s a noob


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah u can @xAfroTrey


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal why do you actually not want us to have admin? TTS - we'll stop using


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
that's EASY to fix


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Tattoblue if u can can u give me the support role I’m on mobile


[18-May-20 11:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
tts can be annoying sometimes but if asked to stop im sure it wouldve been stopped

[18-May-20 11:15 PM] emma;#1525
sorry it was a problem, never got a warning and BODs did it too so assumed it was okay


[18-May-20 11:16 PM] emma;#1525
but that's not a good reason to totally take our admin away and pretend like we dont need it when we legit do


[18-May-20 11:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what is TTS anyways?


[18-May-20 11:16 PM] emma;#1525

@xM_inn they took our admin away


[18-May-20 11:19 PM] emma;#1525

[18-May-20 11:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 11:19 PM] emma;#1525

[18-May-20 11:25 PM] emma;#1525
im not gonna sit around and wait for things to be programmed when all we need is admin .-.


[18-May-20 11:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@Hilton Founder What do you gain from that? Like legit a genuine question.


[18-May-20 11:25 PM] ethan;#0003
there is only like 1 channel we cant see


[18-May-20 11:25 PM] ethan;#0003
management discussion


[18-May-20 11:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This is very annoying.


[18-May-20 11:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
we couldve just had a talk about it


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
like a "hey please stop using tts its getting annoying"


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But no, let's punish a bunch of people.


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] ethan;#0003
ngl you guys where told by every mr to stop


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even those who literally have no idea what was going on.


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ethan, you do realize we can just tell them to use settings right?


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
please @Hilton Founder we need administration for this discord server to run properly


[18-May-20 11:26 PM] ethan;#0003
we have admin....


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] ethan;#0003
we can still kick/ban


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
wtf? ok maybe its annoying but if we dont have admin how are we supposed to even do anything


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
ethan we cant even read tickets


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But what about everything else?


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] emma;#1525
y'all they wont talk to us


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
like if yall wanna read like 70 tickets on ur own, please be my guest


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] emma;#1525
not worth it


[18-May-20 11:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can't set up channels for events and a lot of features are stripped away.


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] ethan;#0003
@a. ღ u dont have the ticket role thats why


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] ethan;#0003
i can give u it


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wait if managers or seniors can kick and ban does that mean they have admin??


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can't update roles, so what's the point? @ethan;


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] emma;#1525
we shouldnt have to resort to giving ourselves MR roles todo anything


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] ethan;#0003
?


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] ethan;#0003
im able to?


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] emma;#1525
this is so embarrassing


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] ethan;#0003
i just gave story support role


[18-May-20 11:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
what


[18-May-20 11:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ethan, at this point, I'm not sure why you're defending them.


[18-May-20 11:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
is that the role that tags u every time a ticket is made

i dont know what your saying


[18-May-20 11:29 PM] ethan;#0003
we can give roles


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ah yes, giving roles except for creating channels, not being able to talk in channels even though the MRs can, etc.


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
you should be able to talk in all channels


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
as before


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
if not, tell me and i can update it


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But what about everything else?


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
some of the rules ones


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
we cant talk in


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
and management discussion


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
you should be able to give roles


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
to anybody


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Tickets and etc are being worked on


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
can you ban and kick?


[18-May-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
ye


[18-May-20 11:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[18-May-20 11:31 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal @babymariobebe just give us back administrator this is so pointless and annoying, don't y'all trust us even a little bit


[18-May-20 11:31 PM] emma;#1525
its legit never been an issue


[18-May-20 11:31 PM] emma;#1525
i dont see why this change has to happen


[18-May-20 11:31 PM] emma;#1525
of ALL things

[18-May-20 11:32 PM] emma;#1525

[18-May-20 11:32 PM] a. ღ#4222

[18-May-20 11:32 PM] stacey#1000
So how are we suppose to do tickets and give people talkative role to get access to the server now....?


[18-May-20 11:32 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal sorry if my cursing makes you FUCKING uncomfortable but this is getting personal


[18-May-20 11:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You know what, I'm literally done for the night.


[18-May-20 11:32 PM] emma;#1525
my cursing in staff lounge does NOT affect anything about my job


[18-May-20 11:32 PM] emma;#1525
when we literally allow it


[18-May-20 11:32 PM] emma;#1525

[18-May-20 11:32 PM] Beartikal#9760

[18-May-20 11:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-May-20 11:33 PM] a. ღ#4222

[18-May-20 11:34 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ oh no i exclusively mean bear, and potentially baby but he hasn't called me out for anything like that so i dont wanna villanize him


[18-May-20 11:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If you're not willing to listen to us, expect some majorr conflict.


[18-May-20 11:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I can see the management discussion??


[18-May-20 11:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We're a 1 million group, this shit is so embarrassing and childish.


[18-May-20 11:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think bloo and I r the only ones that don’t curse still


[18-May-20 11:35 PM] ethan;#0003
and mack


[18-May-20 11:35 PM] ethan;#0003
and polk i think


[18-May-20 11:35 PM] stacey#1000
I curse but not a lot but like I do once in a while


[18-May-20 11:35 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Tickets should be back up!


[18-May-20 11:35 PM] Cam#5887
I just think it’s a little annoying because like.... we are HRs and deserve administrator. Im not power hungry, it’s just that idk how we can do stuff without admin


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And what about us creating channels?


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
i cant even curse in a channel we allow cursing in explicitly


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
whats next


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
we lose superadmin??


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
bc we abuse that too somehow


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
or just admin in general


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
we have to use grammar but no one else does


[18-May-20 11:36 PM] emma;#1525
bc its immature not to


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

I'm not going to lie, I'm really disappointed in you two. @Hilton Founder


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming i curse too fucking much so bear and baby took our administrator


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
apparently


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] a. ღ#4222
i thought yall wanted this group to be "less strict "... like taking away our admin isnt ideal


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] stacey#1000

@a. ღ less strict only applies to LRs


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
wait we are losing admin


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563
No


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
we already lost it

[18-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe "no" but we did lose it


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
?


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] emma;#1525
are we getting it back??


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
You will be able to do everything Except manage the entire server, all your abilities as a HR will remain the same.


[18-May-20 11:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I’m kinda confused


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal what does that even mean


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O ok


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
we need to be able to manage channels and create channels


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] babymariobebe#7563
We're working on it. You won't get the administrator role (every perm) back, but you will be able to do everything you need to do.


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then how do you expect us to do the rest of the May Madness events?


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] a. ღ#4222
are u fr


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] stacey#1000
I can’t run a Q and A next week without being able to manage channels....


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe will we get perms to manage channels and create new channels


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We have a Q&A channel planned for fuck sake.


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
you can manage channels


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
you will*


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
can we CREATE channels


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can allow that


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
like no bot logs


[18-May-20 11:38 PM] emma;#1525
if i continue cursing in staff lounge am i gonna be fired


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
real question


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
if were gonna have all these features why not just give us the admin


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
bc im not gonna curse less so just wondering what my chances are


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What's the point of deleting the role in the first place?


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal does discord give every option administrator gives without giving administrator?


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I need bot logs to see deleted messages from people who need to be warned/banned


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie should ya


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk if that made any sense


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
u cant get in trouble for cursing if there is a RULE that u can


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O ok


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Look right now we're just focusing on cleaning up the discord, the perms were very messy and unoriganized, and we're making it to where you dont need the administrator ability to manage it


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This is SO not cool.


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe it was so much easier when we just had admin tho


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I see it nvm we gucci


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
idk how this makes it "easier"


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
but why @babymariobebe


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
if the only thing you want us not to do is like change the server name... which we'd never do...


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can’t add emojis? 😦


[18-May-20 11:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There was nothing wrong with the roles in the first place, don't fix what's not broken.


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wait so what does administrator do if u can give each thing on its own without it?


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] stacey#1000
I’m just real confused tbh


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@RAMMGaming 🐐


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk what we’d really be missing if we can get basically everything


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
we're just fixing up the discord a bit


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can nvm


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This could've been resolved with an apology, but no.


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal can you answer my question about the cursing


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yeah idk what is different


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] emma;#1525
im not gonna stop cursing in a channel we allow cursing in so am i gonna be fired for cursing


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
why is emma getting targeted for cursing in a channel that uhm everyone curses in..


[18-May-20 11:40 PM] emma;#1525
i literally dont even curse the most


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] emma;#1525
not even CLOSE


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I wonder what bman would thing :(


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] ethan;#0003
there are a lot of mrs that curse


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Probably because they don't like criticism.


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Think*


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] ethan;#0003
like an excess amount of cursing


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
For fuck sake, I literally curse more than Emma.


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] emma;#1525
i personally dont care if people curse as long as its not in a bullying way


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] ethan;#0003
like someone curses so much that they make jokes about how much she curses i forgot her name though


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] stacey#1000
Emma doesn’t curse a lot just like I don’t curse a lot


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] emma;#1525
like if MRs wanna TAKE A BREAK and let off steam by cursing and no one complains about it


[18-May-20 11:41 PM] emma;#1525
then who tf cares


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] emma;#1525
we've already made announcements about the types of cursing we do and dont allow and it hasnt been an issue for anyone


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal can u guys make it so we can see tickets without the support team role? The support role pings us each time a ticket gets made its kind of annoying


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Hilton Founder can u make it so we can se tickets, with the ticket role we legit get tagged everytime a ticket is made


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk if there’s a way to fix that tho


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
probs


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] emma;#1525
its called give us admin


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] emma;#1525
ty


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Tytyty


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah @Cooqkie i was thinking the samem thing


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I got pinged


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And I was like


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't know, by giving us administrator..?


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
**who done this**


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But then I realized


[18-May-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The tickets do that


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] a. ღ#4222
@ethan; if u gave me the support team role can u take it cause i dont want it


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] stacey#1000
What’s the huge issue with us having administrator


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] emma;#1525
idk why we're even asking we've gotten very little that we've been asking for recently


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] emma;#1525
our opinions, always heard, never used


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] ethan;#0003
@a. ღ then u cant view tickets


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] emma;#1525
no point in even having opinions anymore tbh


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] a. ღ#4222
i dont wanna be pinged every time a ticket enters


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] a. ღ#4222
not my fault


[18-May-20 11:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk why we need admin if we can get basically everything without having it


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] emma;#1525
because its going to take a long time for baby and bear to set up the server correctly


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] emma;#1525
we still dont have access to like


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] emma;#1525
anything


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] stacey#1000
Can I still update people’s roles when I promote someone


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
are we not trustworthy ?


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Apparently not, Story.


[18-May-20 11:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
the update command still works


[18-May-20 11:45 PM] Tattoblue#5828
wym


[18-May-20 11:45 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we can still give and take roles


[18-May-20 11:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Better yet, let's not demote and fire people.


[18-May-20 11:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause that's a "bad" thing to do.


[18-May-20 11:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
My god, this literally made my blood boil and I really DID NOT need this for the night.


[18-May-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
wow there's a all too familiar pattern


[18-May-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
third time that's happened in this chat recently


[18-May-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[18-May-20 11:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
when


[18-May-20 11:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
was one time when they first introduced breaks


[18-May-20 11:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not even worth summarizing it at this point.


[18-May-20 11:49 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[19-May-20 12:11 AM] babymariobebe#7563
@everyone Everything should be good to go, let me or @Beartikal know if anything is not the same/needing fixes


[19-May-20 12:11 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[19-May-20 12:11 AM] Cooqkie#2809
did u change the thing


[19-May-20 12:11 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Where we don’t need the support role


[19-May-20 12:11 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe cant create channels


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
wait


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc getting pinged for each ticket is rly annoying


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
if we arent admins


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
we cant configure bots 😂


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Does that mean we can run the bot commands?


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
we can run commands


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
but like


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Huh


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
i dont think we could set up bots


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
bahaha


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] a. ღ#4222
can we read tickets without the support role?


[19-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
i dont have support role and i can read them


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] a. ღ#4222
ok


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe we do need to create channels tho for upcoming events


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
assuming they still happen


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Can u remove mine pls emma


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
done


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ty :D


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] babymariobebe#7563
The channel creation should be possible? is it not?


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
i cant


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Ok let me check


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
only in HR category


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Did u right click in empty space


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
also the latest tickets are from uh 9:26 so maybe we cant see new ones


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
not sure


[19-May-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
I was tagged


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
oh


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
yeah we cant see new tickets


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
just checked ticket logs, one was created like 10 minutes ago that we cant see without support role


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
i'd say let minn fix it but hes not an admin so i dont think he can fix the bot lol


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] Tattoblue#5828
and the support role tags us with each ticket creation, no one wants dat much pingz lol


[19-May-20 12:14 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I think he tried to a few days ago and then said hed try again at a diff time


[19-May-20 12:15 AM] Cooqkie#2809
He was trying 2 fix it though


[19-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
ya we dont have perms to edit the bot


[19-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe have fun being in control of the bot... that we cant fix... bc we dont have manage server perms... lol


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] Beartikal#9760
nothing wrong with bot


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont think


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
we cant read tickets


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
without the support role


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
but we get pinged


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
for every ticket creation


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
minn was fixing it i think but he cant anymore


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] Beartikal#9760
thats not fixable becuase you dont have administrator


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
bc we cant access the bots


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
exactly 🤦‍♀️


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
So give it lol


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] a. ღ#4222
then we need admin..


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
guess we are deleting the ticket bot then


[19-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
since we can't read tickets


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
you can


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
im not being pinged


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
with **support tole**


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
200 times


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
a day


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
no one is


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
mute


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
doesnt work


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] a. ღ#4222
the support role TAGS U every second


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
pings still show up


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it doesn't work lol


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal so the bot pings us every time a new ticket is made if we have the support team role idk if there’s a way to fix it but if u can find a way that would be nice :D


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can find an alternate ticket bot if thats what u guys wanna do


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
the other ticket bot broke


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm literally worried about ur awareness at this point lol


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
this one would be FINE if you let minn fix it


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
but you took his admin


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
so he can't fix it


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont think its a setitng of the bot maam


[19-May-20 12:18 AM] Beartikal#9760
the programmer made it that way


[19-May-20 12:19 AM] emma;#1525
uh it is bc it wasnt an issue at first


[19-May-20 12:19 AM] emma;#1525
like when we first added it


[19-May-20 12:19 AM] emma;#1525
we've had this bot before and it never did that

[19-May-20 12:19 AM] Beartikal#9760
every permission is granted without the need for admin

[19-May-20 12:21 AM] emma;#1525
and makes everyone lose privileges we literally need


[19-May-20 12:21 AM] Cooqkie#2809
But only MRs saw it?


[19-May-20 12:21 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[19-May-20 12:21 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ik there’s hrs that have done it in general chay


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
Cursing is allowed


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] a. ღ#4222
everyone curses


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
literally not a rule


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] a. ღ#4222
lmao


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ღ i get that - but even so it just goes to show that we just need to have more control over who gets what permissions - I might allow BODs to have Administrator


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
and TTS has been used


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
TWO DAYS


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
in total


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
TWO DAYS


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
and the MRs always laughed and had fun with it


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
and it was never more than


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
like 20 minutes??


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
max??


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] a. ღ#4222
couldnt we have a talk about the tts ?


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
and y'all aren't good enough owners to believe in our ability to have meaningful conversations


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes, no TTS.


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
because you just punish us before even asking us to stop something


[19-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
ever heard of a WARNING


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
its what you give to people you trust can change without punishment


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] Tattoblue#5828
2 of the bods used it lol


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] a. ღ#4222
ya?


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
no one even cares about TTS not gonna miss it lmao coulda just asked like a mature person


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
since you love maturity so much


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] a. ღ#4222
ur gonna give admin to the bods but two of them did it too?


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont think bods having admin helps too anyways


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
bonnie's the reason we knew about TTS


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
he showed us


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
and did it in SL first


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
😂


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
They arent always admin-ing the server


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] emma;#1525
but you didnt see that so its all my fault ig


[19-May-20 12:23 AM] Cooqkie#2809
But half the bods have used tts in general emma only used it in SL from what I know


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] a. ღ#4222
bonnie abused the fuck out of it the first day (no hate bonnie ) but u only go after emma


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
yeah ive never used it in general


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
nobody has admin at this point then @a. ღ


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
because baby DOES NOT LIKE EM


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
bear


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525

sorry baby


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
y'all are twins


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
get you mixed up


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
god to feel hated by your own "boss" its a good feeling


[19-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
liberating


[19-May-20 12:26 AM] emma;#1525
this whole chat is so toxic i just want to leave it for a week but i feel like im not allowed to take a break from it without giving everything up


[19-May-20 12:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ღ i saw emma today and pointed it out, i dont look at the discussion often but today i noticed it


[19-May-20 12:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
and took action against it


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont like to be the ruiner of fun, but sometimes its a little extreme


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
ok u saw her do what the tts or cursing ?


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
because uhm cursing IS allowed


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
tts


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
notice how he doesn't even say anything about the fact i think he hates me


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
that says a lot doesnt it


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
he's not even talking to me rn


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
just ignoring me


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
bc im so immature


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
and curse too much


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] Cooqkie#2809
He’s being rly rude to u rn


[19-May-20 12:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
bear i get that u might not have seen others do it in the past. but if ur gonna say other hrs do it too and only bring up proof on emma, its kind of unfair to her


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
sorry but im pointing out what im seeing


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
i havent seen the others do it


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
But this is only 1 time


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
"oh no emma i dont hate you"


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
"wow bear thanks for clearing that up"


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
add that to the convos im not seeing right now


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
lmao


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Emma is probs 1 of the most mature and does the most stuff here


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
🤦‍♀️


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
She should be acknowledged instead


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] a. ღ#4222
we got admin taking away from something a simple "Hey, can yall not do this blah blah blah" would have probably solved without this big argument


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack but i curse in SL.... so im immature


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
No


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] Tattoblue#5828

U do so much


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
and i used TTS... after bonnie literally told us we could....


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
but IM immature


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
and abusive


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
and bear cant even talk to me


[19-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
but IM the immature one


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Look guys @everyone the main reason for the removing of the administrator role was for security reasons and to clean up the server because the roles didn't exactly correspond with what they said they did. So basically we made it to where the roles work with or without administrator rather than how it was before. Everything needed to do your daily tasks/duties and managing the server should be exactly the same and nothing major should be affected. No, this does not mean we do not trust any of you, this just means that the server roles and perms were outdated and that this is something that should have been done long ago to tidy up the server.


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] babymariobebe#7563
I have already informed Minn about this in DMs earlier


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe we still can't use the ticket bot


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
so are you fixing it or


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
are we just


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
not doing tickets anymore?


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
bc no one is gonna read tickets if we have to be pinged


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
and muting still shows the pings


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] a. ღ#4222
then why is bear saying it was removed from abuse? 😂


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
because HE DOES NOT LIKE ME


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
AND WILL NOT


[19-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
SAY THAT


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
making it seem like my fault


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] Tattoblue#5828
what do you mean the roles don't correspond? lol @babymariobebe they were fine before, if they weren't then people would've complained


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] babymariobebe#7563
The TTS was removed due to abuse


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
literally bear and baby had 2 different reasons


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] babymariobebe#7563
not the administrator role


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] a. ღ#4222
no he said our admin was removed from that..


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe did you even consider asking us to just... not use TTS...


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
bc you say you trust us


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
but you didnt trust us enough to just


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
ask us to stop


[19-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
and trust us to actually listen


[19-May-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
and its hard to believe that's the real reason admin was taken when bear's just blamed me for being abusive lol


[19-May-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
he's just ignoring me though


[19-May-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
its like im not even talking


[19-May-20 12:31 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Look guys is TTS really that important..?


[19-May-20 12:31 AM] Tattoblue#5828
it's not


[19-May-20 12:31 AM] a. ღ#4222
thats not what we are saying


[19-May-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
its not the TTS its the fact that we were told ORIGINALLY that admin was removed because of abuse with TTS and me being immature


[19-May-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
aka its all MY fault


[19-May-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
because thats what bear told us


[19-May-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
the server looks fixed enough so even tho it sucks you are pretending like admin is "outdated" when most groups give their TRUSTED hrs admin at least that's not a *huge* problem other than some minor detaisl


[19-May-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
details


[19-May-20 12:33 AM] emma;#1525
the only thing we cant do it what, change the server name and region lmao like we didn't do that anyways but ok


[19-May-20 12:34 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe we cant put slowmode on


[19-May-20 12:34 AM] emma;#1525
thats gonna be an issue


[19-May-20 12:34 AM] emma;#1525
when we host public events in our server


[19-May-20 12:34 AM] emma;#1525
we have an event in 5 days that we'll NEED slowmode for if we want it to work


[19-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
I’m not sure how I’m suppose to host a Q and A now


[19-May-20 12:54 AM] Beartikal#9760
Due to limitations, we have added Administrator permissions back. I do expect you all to to behave professionally and remind yourselves that we are look up upon and need to act as appropriate role models. You guys brought up some valid concerns about the roles and the need for administrator. @everyone


[19-May-20 12:55 AM] Beartikal#9760
Including in the staff lounge, remember to maintain a professional attitude, this can serve as a reminder for all of us.


[19-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
uh we're all still gonna curse, the MRs literally respect us so much so its not really an actual concern


[19-May-20 12:56 AM] Tattoblue#5828
does professional mean no cursing @Beartikal in the staff lounge


[19-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
TTS can leave, dont need that


[19-May-20 12:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thanks for the administrator back tho


[19-May-20 12:56 AM] emma;#1525
-pushes TTS out the window- bye


[19-May-20 12:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
in my own opinion, I don't need cursing to communicate an idea, but that's just me
just dont spam curse or anything too much, keep it to a minimum


[19-May-20 12:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
just to clear some things up


[19-May-20 12:58 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll just not curse because I rarely curse anyways


[19-May-20 12:58 AM] emma;#1525
i mean 🤷‍♀️ i think its our choices how we want to come off to MRs, if they have a problem or dont respect us because of it then it can be a concenr


[19-May-20 12:58 AM] emma;#1525
but they curse more than us anyways


[19-May-20 12:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
i just feel as we're higher ranks we should maintain a better rep


[19-May-20 12:59 AM] Beartikal#9760

[19-May-20 01:01 AM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal i think its unprofessional when you guys mess around with trollers and CBs and bascially encourage them to continue instead of stopping


[19-May-20 01:01 AM] emma;#1525
is that changing too


[19-May-20 01:01 AM] emma;#1525

[19-May-20 01:02 AM] Beartikal#9760

[19-May-20 02:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
programming is fun actually once i understand it well


[19-May-20 02:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
like object oriented programming in python


[19-May-20 02:11 AM] Beartikal#9760
```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("test function");
}
```
C# fun too but i havent done it in a while


[19-May-20 02:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but holy doing a manual sorting algorithm in python is not fun


[19-May-20 02:11 AM] Beartikal#9760
it can make discord bots too


[19-May-20 02:11 AM] Beartikal#9760
so can python


[19-May-20 02:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i wan to use sorted() so badly


[19-May-20 02:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

its just a sample code


[19-May-20 02:50 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i think it justs needs another if else


[19-May-20 02:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
oh then just do else
return bla and bla and bla


[19-May-20 02:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
if not found


[19-May-20 02:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
not too hard


[19-May-20 02:51 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but under which if


[19-May-20 02:51 AM] Beartikal#9760
i mean


[19-May-20 02:51 AM] Beartikal#9760
send ur code


[19-May-20 02:51 AM] Beartikal#9760
if it fit

it should

[19-May-20 02:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
looks right whats wrong wif it


[19-May-20 02:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
idk lol


[19-May-20 02:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the if x+y == z works


[19-May-20 02:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
does it like say eror or does it run but no right info


[19-May-20 02:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Input a number:21
X = 16
Y = 5
TRUE (since X + Y = Z i.e to say 16 + 5 = 21 )


[19-May-20 02:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
run but no info

the end of


[19-May-20 02:54 AM] Beartikal#9760
```python
for i in range(n):
    for q in range(n):
```
so like if i did that in Lua its
```lua
for k,v in pairs(n) do
    for k2,v2 in pairs(n) do
      
    end
end
```
where the end is determined by End, how does it work in python to know when the end is reached i think its by Indentation right?


[19-May-20 02:54 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye by indentation

ah ok

i mean try dat


[19-May-20 02:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
might error


[19-May-20 02:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
but

theres a rule against it, rule 16 i think so feel free to warn (i recommend only warning if they have like their lr role, if they dont just close and tell them to say !getroles) @PackItUpMack


[19-May-20 10:08 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

i like that


[19-May-20 02:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
we should make all seniors do that


[19-May-20 02:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
thats a a solid record that we can keep of passers then


[19-May-20 02:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
still make them do the description though


[19-May-20 02:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
but like if they misspell or something, easy to check


[19-May-20 02:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
can they still be required to spell it in the description


[19-May-20 02:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc then ranking would take forever


[19-May-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
yea thats what i said


[19-May-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
we'd also struggle searching for records via their name


[19-May-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
so make 'em do both

aubr8y is a confirmed alt yes


[19-May-20 04:21 PM] stacey#1000

[19-May-20 04:21 PM] stacey#1000
and ive been in vc with her before


[19-May-20 04:21 PM] stacey#1000

hey guys what logs would you like added to bloxton if you could have any log"?
to be added:
``Cuff Logs``
``Advanced Chat Logs``
``Advanced Join Logs``


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525

[19-May-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525

[19-May-20 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
advanced chat logs


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
time they said that message not just a list


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
more stuff to see


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Polk#1596
exploit logs


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
like when, to who


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Polk#1596
if tht is possible lol


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
exploit logs is definitely do able


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what does the list do


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Polk#1596
really?


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
of course it wont be perfect


[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[19-May-20 04:28 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
yaaa


[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Polk#1596
then we dont havw to watch the exploiter do it


[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Polk#1596
they hide in walls sometimes


[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
correct, but exploit logs are never perfect keep that in mind


[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
some exploiters can trick the system


[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
and make it not log them


[19-May-20 04:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[19-May-20 04:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
it will catch some though so i will still add it


[19-May-20 04:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill do my best xd


[19-May-20 04:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
its a cat and mouse game with dev and exploit logs basically


[19-May-20 04:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[19-May-20 04:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
but ill make sure it catches common things like fly, etc


[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
idk if u know but


[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
if people get an autoclickee


[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
and spam 1 five million times every secodn, they are able to noclip


[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
is it possible if it can detect high speeda like that


[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
speeda


[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Polk#1596

[19-May-20 04:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah roblox's trashy toolbox system makes it do that


[19-May-20 04:32 PM] Polk#1596
ok awesome, thats probably one of the most common ones because anyone can do it


[19-May-20 04:32 PM] Polk#1596
yeahh


[19-May-20 04:34 PM] Beartikal#9760

[19-May-20 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal I think there is a glitch for the suites lane because a couple users that own the suite gamepass get banned because it says for receptionist they don't have the gamepass when they do.


[19-May-20 06:36 PM] stacey#1000
Like it comes up and says they don't own the gamepass so people report them.


[19-May-20 07:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
interesting


[19-May-20 07:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
also they should be checking if they own the gamepass


[19-May-20 07:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
not just ban with a message


[19-May-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
not everyone has their inventory's on


[19-May-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
for people to check


[19-May-20 07:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
true


[19-May-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
thats what happened in the case of the guy I had to unban


[19-May-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
his inventory was off but he showed me proof he owned, turned his inventory on for me to check and sure enough he owned the gamepass but the person that reported him showed the game said he didnt own it

X = not found
Y = not found
FALSE (since there does not exist two integers X and Y in SEQ, where X+Y = Z)

[19-May-20 09:56 PM] emma;#1525

[19-May-20 09:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-May-20 09:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's not like he's going to senior anytime soon @emma;


[19-May-20 09:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It was in arsenal


[19-May-20 09:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and he was saying it as an insult


[19-May-20 09:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
towards someone


[19-May-20 09:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and when confronted made up a story


[19-May-20 09:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wasn't it to someone who killed him lol


[19-May-20 09:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
im gonna go berserk over code


[19-May-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack i coded once upon a time whats wrong


[19-May-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
wait what language


[19-May-20 09:59 PM] emma;#1525
im very limited


[19-May-20 09:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
this is challenge question


[19-May-20 09:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[19-May-20 09:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait mack do you use python 3


[19-May-20 10:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-May-20 10:00 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[19-May-20 10:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
```def notfound():

[19-May-20 10:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
this is the current code i have


[19-May-20 10:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but problem is everytime it gives true, the notfound() will print too


[19-May-20 10:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL

🙄


[19-May-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack so im not a python expert BUT it looks like you're running notfound() every time in your sequenceAlgo function


[19-May-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
like its running once it exits the while loop


[19-May-20 10:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye bear solved it


[19-May-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525

[19-May-20 11:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
we definitely need to consider firing darren at the end of this month


[19-May-20 11:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
why does he keep attention seeking his resignation as well


[19-May-20 11:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk


[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
i didnt know it was this bad


[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xM_inn#2821

[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
look at the other ss's stacey sent


[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
sorry but I'd rather have us promote a better manager to replace him


[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's on bman's communication too


[19-May-20 11:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
who's your pick thus far @xM_inn


[19-May-20 11:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im pretty confident that emmy or drxzzle can be good replacements


[19-May-20 11:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmmm let's see


[19-May-20 11:27 PM] xM_inn#2821

[19-May-20 11:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Beartikal sure


[20-May-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
I have many reasons why darren should be fired trust me @xM_inn


[20-May-20 12:03 AM] xM_inn#2821
yea he defo needs to go now


[20-May-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000

[20-May-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000

[20-May-20 12:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
alright


[20-May-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000

[20-May-20 12:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye he shud go


[20-May-20 12:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Hes making his resignation a whole big thing like jack


[20-May-20 12:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
And making it known like 2 months


[20-May-20 12:06 AM] xM_inn#2821
he talks like jack


[20-May-20 12:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Hes not even doing much too


[20-May-20 12:06 AM] xM_inn#2821
he's probably jack on an alt LOL


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] stacey#1000
also im not the one terminating him


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
wait


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] stacey#1000
he basically blocked me


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
do we


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
suspend for stealing reports?


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
we do, right?


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] stacey#1000
after the argument i got into with him last night


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] stacey#1000
yes


[20-May-20 12:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
thought so, thanks!


[20-May-20 12:08 AM] stacey#1000
go vote to fire darren


[20-May-20 12:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
im getting jack 2.0 vibes


[20-May-20 12:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
just resign


[20-May-20 12:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
if ur going to resign


[20-May-20 12:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
lol


[20-May-20 12:09 AM] xM_inn#2821
yee no need to drag it on this long


[20-May-20 12:09 AM] stacey#1000
who wants to fire him


[20-May-20 12:09 AM] stacey#1000
I am literally not doing it sorry


[20-May-20 12:09 AM] xM_inn#2821
and if he's legit just staying in his job to resign on a specific date and being very inactive then he shouldn't get to resign


[20-May-20 12:09 AM] stacey#1000
I am still upset over the argument I had with him over demoting him from co-owner in my server


[20-May-20 12:10 AM] stacey#1000
im not talking to him


[20-May-20 12:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
i'll do it if nobody else will, but i'd prefer someone else does it


[20-May-20 12:11 AM] stacey#1000
Darren made me stressed beyond belief yesterday oml


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; Literally there is no benefit to keeping Darren on the senior team.


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
I get he is doing 1 thing a week, but its literally not fair to other seniors.


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
He never hosts anything.


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
no y'all dont understand we CANNOT fire someone because they're *planning* on resigning soon


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] emma;#1525
that is not a good enough reason


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
Thats not why we want to fire him not the full reason.


[20-May-20 12:12 AM] stacey#1000
It's his attitude and overall outlook of being a senior.


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
no you also dont think he's active enough but he's doing more than fraux did on his 1 year of inactivity lol


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
stacey no offense but i feel like this is partly bc of your server drama


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
No, this was before that.


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
He has 4 votes to terminate, Bman votes to terminate too.


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] emma;#1525
then what are the other reasons bc all ive seen is he's doing "the minimum" work to stay


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont even think its the minimum


[20-May-20 12:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Its like 1 item on the checklist


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Which is 1/9 of the minimum


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
if he's doing anything he's doing more than some other seniors have on inactivity


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] stacey#1000
His attitude is the main thing.


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] stacey#1000
He has the attitude he is better than everyone else and is really immature.


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
can you send pics to back that up


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
he's attention seeking


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
constantly


[20-May-20 12:14 AM] emma;#1525
i mean i dont like him but we have night literally calling someone a black jew and i dont see any vote for him


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
and THAT is racist


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
Like...I've never seen someone announce their resigning 5+ weeks in advance to say "come to my office"


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
@jack


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] emma;#1525
jack did lmaoooo


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
jack on an ALT


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
Darrenovation


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont get he shud stay since he has a due date


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Giving his spot to someone more worthy is better


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
He is really attention seeking and acting like he's better than everyone and I've had plenty of MRs complain to me about it.


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
if he's gonna resign he should just resign


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hes like OMG GUYS IM RESIGNING ON 31 JULY


[20-May-20 12:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
COME TO MY OFFICE


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
i have an idea


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
instead of firing him just force him to resign then


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Who freaking cares


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
let's fire him on July 30th


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] stacey#1000
No


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] emma;#1525
but im not dealing with a false termination bc y'all hate darren 😂 ive seen 0 screenshots from you about his attitude


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
wait darren has an office


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ya


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
WOW THAT IS MEGA JACK VIBES

haha @xM_inn very funni


[20-May-20 12:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
if we're not firing him then force him to resign


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
or like demote him to manager


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
he's wasting a senior spot


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
also @stacey we need wayyy more than 5 votes for a senior termination for me to feel comfy with that


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
like 5 votes is really not a lot


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] stacey#1000
I know that


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] stacey#1000
Im just saying he has 4 rn


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
bman cant even see our convos though


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
jack took 2 weeks to finally resign, darren is taking 2 months


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
.


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
.


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
.


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] emma;#1525
he cant make an informed choice without being involved in these convos


[20-May-20 12:17 AM] stacey#1000
Look at his card.


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] stacey#1000
He had plenty to say about him on it.


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn uh i planned my resignation for a month before y'all promoted me lmao


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
so that's just not really a point i love y'all using against darren


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] emma;#1525
bc plenty of people have planned resignations


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
yes but


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
you didn't attention seek


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
and start saying


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] stacey#1000
He is literally attention seeking.


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
im resigning on blah blah blah


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
ill miss u guys


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
dont forget my resignation!


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
blah blah blah


[20-May-20 12:18 AM] stacey#1000
And showing he genuinely doesn't care about his job.


[20-May-20 12:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
if we're not firing then someone speak to him and tell him to stop attention seeking


[20-May-20 12:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
cause it is annoying.


[20-May-20 12:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I can tell him to stop if no one wants to


[20-May-20 12:19 AM] stacey#1000
Its really unfair for him to keep his rank when hes not hosting, only doing 1 thing a week like applications to keep his rank. He did 30 applications last minute.


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] stacey#1000
And before I sent him the inactive letter keep in mind he was doing 0% each week


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] stacey#1000
That was for months


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
If hes gone then wooo


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Another big enemy gone


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Add a check into my checklist


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] stacey#1000
Honestly I see 0 benefit to keeping him on the senior team.


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I see 0 too


[20-May-20 12:20 AM] stacey#1000
We want someone that will benefit the senior team. Explain to me how he's benefitting the senior team exactly.


[20-May-20 12:21 AM] xM_inn#2821
Well if we don't feel comfortable firing him, I think we have a strong enough argument to **at least** demote him to management.


[20-May-20 12:21 AM] stacey#1000
Also, he literally left the discord server.


[20-May-20 12:21 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Oh a jack move


[20-May-20 12:21 AM] emma;#1525
I dont like darren i was against him BEING promoted in the first place


[20-May-20 12:21 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Praise the lord


[20-May-20 12:21 AM] emma;#1525
but he's been a decent senior for a long enough time where I dont think we should fire him for being a bit dramatic because y'all are over him


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
y'all fought for him tooth and nail lol deal with him for 2 more months we aren't even full on seniors


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
if we get full on seniors then we can consider it


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I didnt even fight eeks


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] stacey#1000
That's not fair to other seniors though. To just keep Darren for 2 months, there is 0 point.


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I barely fought ngl


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I was just thrown a darren to promote


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] stacey#1000
There is literally no point.


[20-May-20 12:22 AM] emma;#1525
its not affecting other seniors though


[20-May-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
again if you all have photos of darren actually showing terminating behavior (and being a bit of an attention seeker isnt bc we'd fire half our team 😂) please post them bc i havent been seeing any


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok well like Emma said let’s just either tell him to resign at this point or tell him to do a little more than what he’s doing if his intentions are July 31st or whatever date he is planning


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] stacey#1000
Literally, he is immature and doesn't deal with conflict. He left the discord when people confronted him about what he posted last night. He thinks he's better than everyone else, and overall I don't like his attitude and the way he is viewing things.


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] emma;#1525
so many MRs have left the discord before bc of "confrontation"


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] emma;#1525
and it's never been an issue


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] Tattoblue#5828
our discord? @stacey


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] emma;#1525
ive even brought it up and been told "they dont technically have to be in it"


[20-May-20 12:25 AM] stacey#1000
Yes.


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] emma;#1525
and darren's been immautre SINCE BEFORE Y'ALL WANTED TO PROMOTE HIM TO SENIOR that shouldnt be a shock 😂


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
while we're on the topic, i think it should be a requirement for MRs to be in the discord


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] emma;#1525
same minn


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
we post so much stuff in there vital to mr careers


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
It should be.


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
It's annoying when they leave and ask for their roles back when they rejoin.


[20-May-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
If they don't want to look at the server then they don't have to look at the server.


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
there’s mrs who aren’t in the discord?


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] stacey#1000
If they are upset.


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I didn’t even know that lmao


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] stacey#1000
Idk if there is rn


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought all of ours Mrs were on the discord even if they aren’t active


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] stacey#1000
I think they are


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
we've had plenty of MRs leave before for like a day or two


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
they even do it as jokes


[20-May-20 12:27 AM] emma;#1525
holly did it like last week


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] stacey#1000
Its annoying tho


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
god speaking of attention seeking HOLLY is a big one


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
also if they're not in the discord, we're going to struggle to contact them


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
like who reads roblox messages often?


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] Tattoblue#5828
lets fire her while we're at it!1 @emma;


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
i do, but i know a lot of people dont


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] stacey#1000
Can we like warn them for doing it


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I never look at my Roblox pms


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I have like 20 from last year that I still haven’t seen


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
i think it should be you need to be in the discord, if you leave you'll be warned, and if you don't join back within 24 hours you'll be demoted to LR


[20-May-20 12:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Roblox messages are pretty useless tbh


[20-May-20 12:29 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
they are


[20-May-20 12:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not sure if I like that rule @xM_inn


[20-May-20 12:29 AM] emma;#1525
i dont like the 24 hour to LR rule


[20-May-20 12:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
its pretty simple; just dont leave the discord


[20-May-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
maybe a suspension first


[20-May-20 12:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
eh ok, i just think if people know they're at risk of being demoted, it'll scare them into not leaving the discord


[20-May-20 12:30 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’d like it better if it was constant leaving. I think once if you’re just trying to get away from any issues you have in it  then that’s totally fine but if it’s a constant leaving then a warning should def be in place


[20-May-20 12:32 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Im nvr gonna leave


[20-May-20 12:32 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
If not my join position will gg


[20-May-20 12:32 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
😩


[20-May-20 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
ok so theres my case on darren. If you want to keep him thats fine, but I see literally no benefit to keeping him on the senior team


[20-May-20 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
If we're keeping him, someone warn him or something on his attention seeking and attitude.


[20-May-20 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
If possible.

Rip she was just promoted not long ago but she’s gotta go now


[20-May-20 01:20 PM] stacey#1000
I explained to her clearly about no leaking


[20-May-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
But she can’t follow that so bye bye to her


[20-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
oh yeah i asked if she knew about our no leaking policy and she said yes lmao


[20-May-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
I sent her a good paragraph or more on it


[20-May-20 01:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
dang she leaked already


[20-May-20 01:23 PM] stacey#1000
🤡


[20-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
mkay just fired her


[20-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
yayyyy


[20-May-20 01:25 PM] stacey#1000
Lmao she lasted maybe 2 weeks


[20-May-20 01:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
not even 2 weeks


[20-May-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
1 week


[20-May-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
1 week and a half


[20-May-20 01:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes lmao


[20-May-20 01:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that’s so embarrassing


[20-May-20 01:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it’s embarrassing when mrs careers last less than 2 weeks


[20-May-20 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
I explained it to her clearly and she still chose to do it. Disappointing


[20-May-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
LOL

[20-May-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
This girl found out fast


[20-May-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
Oh Emma announced that’s why


[20-May-20 01:36 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey yeah i put up a second announcement to MRs telling them they shouldn't be announcing terminations as resignations without permission from the person who was fired bc that's honestly just rude and technically lying and TECHNICALLY leaking


[20-May-20 01:36 PM] stacey#1000
I was wondering how it was found out so fast I’m updating my server for that


[20-May-20 01:41 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; what did she leak  exactly anyway from sl


[20-May-20 01:42 PM] emma;#1525
go to #ongoing-investigations


[20-May-20 01:42 PM] emma;#1525
polk has it all there


[20-May-20 01:42 PM] stacey#1000
o


[20-May-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
apparently someone is either leaking to meme orrrr meme has a MR accountttt


[20-May-20 02:10 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk how much longer is your celebration going


[20-May-20 02:10 PM] emma;#1525
Bc I have trainings soooon


[20-May-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
like 10 minutes


[20-May-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
ik ik


[20-May-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; yes if people really want to they can see every single channel name in the server but can’t get access to see the content of it


[20-May-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve seen someone send one of all the channels with senior channels too


[20-May-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
awhile ago


[20-May-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
just interesting that she didn't give any info about HR channels or anything, although if she's trying to frame a manager then ofc she wouldn't be showing channels they dont have access too


[20-May-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
But it has the lock thing beside it so they can’t actually see what’s being said


[20-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey well only VCs appear with JUST a lock by them if you can't access them


[20-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
text channels all just have the hashtag with the mini-lock


[20-May-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
unless they have no restrictions


[20-May-20 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
Are they suppose to see who’s in the vc


[20-May-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
Like does the program do that too


[20-May-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve never seen it where it tells you who’s in the vc


[20-May-20 02:20 PM] emma;#1525
I'm not sure


[20-May-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
It’s weird.


[20-May-20 02:21 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve heard you can see all channels somehow but not the content in it but like I’ve never heard of seeing who’s in the vc if you can’t actually join it


[20-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk ur really out here revealing your first name to people


[20-May-20 02:21 PM] emma;#1525
as we actively say "dont give people your personal info" 😂


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] Polk#1596
its a first name so idc


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
i missed the whole announcement until you said "im personal so its big for me to reveal something"


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
and i thought the reveal was after that


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
so i was eagerly waiting


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
turns out I MISSED IT


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[20-May-20 02:22 PM] Polk#1596
LOL


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] Polk#1596
yes i made them all guess


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] Polk#1596
it was funny


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’ve seen discord servers where I’ve seen people in the calls but I’ve never specifically seen it for our server


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah this the first I’ve heard of it


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
Also if it’s just first name I don’t see an issue lol. Everyone knows my first name because legit I would feel weird being called anything else


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so idk I feel like meow doesn’t have anything besides she can see the channels but nothing in them


[20-May-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
i'll just ask ryan about it and see if his program he had would let him see it


[20-May-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
@Bloo_Berriez its meme


[20-May-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
get our annoying stalkers RIGHT


[20-May-20 02:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh meme


[20-May-20 02:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What is it anyways


[20-May-20 02:24 PM] stacey#1000
“Whar”


[20-May-20 02:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Nvm I figured it out


[20-May-20 02:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Damn his name is cooler than I thought


[20-May-20 02:25 PM] stacey#1000
What is it


[20-May-20 02:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Search up "polk name" in the search bar on Bloxton


[20-May-20 02:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he’s Norwegian I’m sure there’s a lot of cool names parents name their kids lol


[20-May-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Cool name


[20-May-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
well magnus is common in other countries i think


[20-May-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
right?


[20-May-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
no


[20-May-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
but it is a very norwegian name so like


[20-May-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
we have actual norwegian names with norwegian letters like ø æ å


[20-May-20 02:46 PM] emma;#1525
its not a weird name


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
is it


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
I THOUGHT IT WAS COMMON


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
idk it sounds norwegian


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
no idea if it is common for y'all or not


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
LOL


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
no but like


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596

[20-May-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
but i have never met a magnus in the US


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
with an english accent


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
it sounds normal


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] emma;#1525
i dont have an english accent


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596
but if it was an actual norwegian name like


[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596

[20-May-20 02:47 PM] Polk#1596

[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
That makes more sense


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you fail you dont have to retake tho


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I thought u had to pay to take it in general


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
its if u want to


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Oooo


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
scores range from 1-5


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
with 3 being satisfactory


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
3 = some colleges take it
4 = most colleges take it
5 = ivy leagues take it


[20-May-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760

[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ooooooo


[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
an AP exam is for Advanced Placement


[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
meaning you take college level class in high school


[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
do well enough, and you just did a college class in high school


[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that’s cool


[20-May-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[20-May-20 03:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
for computer science i obviously got a 5 because Roblox experience basically allowed me to ace it


[20-May-20 03:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ooo


[20-May-20 03:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
it was a different programming language but once you know enough of one language the next is super easy


[20-May-20 03:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
R the diff ones similar


[20-May-20 03:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
syntax


[20-May-20 03:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
programming languages are different in the way they are written


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
all do the same


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
```lua
print("Hello World!")
```
```java
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
three different langauges


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
all doing the same thing


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
The top one looks the easiest


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
of course the top one is Roblox/Lua yep


[20-May-20 03:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
Roblox makes it easy


[20-May-20 03:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats how i was able to learn as a kid


[20-May-20 03:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ooo


[20-May-20 03:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
its easier


[20-May-20 03:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
shorter


[20-May-20 03:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
etc


[20-May-20 03:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ye


[20-May-20 03:48 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal YOU GOT A FREE AP TEST??


[20-May-20 03:48 PM] emma;#1525
or were they all free this year


[20-May-20 03:48 PM] emma;#1525
bc of corona


[20-May-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
mine were all $100 :( even my first one


[20-May-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie maam dont forget to rank your passers its been 24 hours!!! me and ethan will haunt you


[20-May-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; Darren has 7 votes how many do you think is reasonable to terminate him


[20-May-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
10?


[20-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think anyone has posted any supporting evidence to back this up other than him saying like 2 times he's planning on resigning


[20-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
i asked multiple times for proof of his behavior and no one posted anything 😂


[20-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
like im sure it exists but


[20-May-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
still want to see it


[20-May-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
bc this feels very personal against darren from multiple people... and as someone who probably hates him the most the fact that even i can see that this is a bit sketchy is surprising


[20-May-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
all the arguments for terminating darren, except for him having a planned resignation, are all things other MRs show on a daily basis so


[20-May-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
unless im missing something im just not sure


[20-May-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
I’m moving to bmans communication thing rn to discuss it with him too


[20-May-20 04:11 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll send the couple things I really disliked he’s done


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’m mobile so I can’t check but has Darren done anything for this week or no @stacey


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well I can check but I’m too lazy


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
...


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
u dont get to know then


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
lazy


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
...


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no it’s cause trello mobile app is like it never works


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So I had to delete it


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
darren has done nothing this week


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
he's done 1 thing since may 5th


[20-May-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
which was 30 apps


[20-May-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
He hasn’t done anything yet


[20-May-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
He always does something very last minute like the night before checklists are done


[20-May-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
He doesn’t actually host or do anything really


[20-May-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
Wait he did nothing last week


[20-May-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
It’s either he does nothing or he does 1 small thing last minute


[20-May-20 05:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; I’ll do it in a few mins sry D:


[20-May-20 05:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I was staring at the same math problem for like 2 hrs lol


[20-May-20 05:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So I kinda died after that


[20-May-20 05:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Do we let people their sexuality


[20-May-20 10:40 PM] emma;#1525
In our discord server


[20-May-20 10:40 PM] emma;#1525
I thought no Bc it’s related to dating which we don’t let people talk about


[20-May-20 10:40 PM] emma;#1525
idc either way just don’t remember


[20-May-20 10:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
huh


[20-May-20 10:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[20-May-20 10:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
share theirs?


[20-May-20 10:43 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie yeah, like bella just made a doc about hers and posted it in general


[20-May-20 10:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i see no issue with it tbh


[20-May-20 10:44 PM] emma;#1525
and like idc honestly as long as it's not in a "dating" way (her letter defo wasnt) but i thought we had previously told people not to talk about sexuality bc its not relevant to anything but dating really


[20-May-20 10:44 PM] emma;#1525
so i just wanted to check


[20-May-20 10:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't recall that happening before


[20-May-20 10:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
either way, i personally do not mind it


[20-May-20 10:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya I think it should be fine too


[20-May-20 10:51 PM] stacey#1000

[21-May-20 07:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
we need a track all players command


[21-May-20 07:45 AM] stacey#1000
We need exploit logs


[21-May-20 07:46 AM] stacey#1000
This exploit is literally real disturbing and inappropriate. I’ve never seen an exploit like this before

Also holy shit I had to deal with a CB raid


[21-May-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was adida, amiee, iambloxton, and a few others


[21-May-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They joined like 20 times and it was painful to catch up to them


[21-May-20 02:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They just came back once I left, but I really don't wanna obsess and overwork myself trying to ban them


[21-May-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey are they still there


[21-May-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
Whenever you need help with a raid tag me


[21-May-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000

[21-May-20 06:08 PM] stacey#1000

[21-May-20 06:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[21-May-20 06:09 PM] stacey#1000

@xAfroTrey you can ask her to go to the hotel or something


[21-May-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
or wait until the weekend thats when I see her


[21-May-20 06:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my due date is today, but if the extension works, i can do it on the weekend


[21-May-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000

[21-May-20 06:12 PM] stacey#1000

[21-May-20 06:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[21-May-20 09:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[21-May-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[21-May-20 09:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[21-May-20 10:03 PM] ethan;#0003

kyle like mr kyle?


[22-May-20 10:11 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes


[22-May-20 10:11 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-May-20 10:11 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya thats not ok


[22-May-20 10:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[22-May-20 10:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
that doesnt rly show that it was kyle in that?


[22-May-20 10:13 AM] Cooqkie#2809
he only sent u pics of the game


[22-May-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
Honestly, if Bella was uncomfortable with how he was designing her on the sims she shouldve notified him


[22-May-20 10:19 AM] stacey#1000
there is no rule against designing people on the sims so...


[22-May-20 10:20 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@katie do u think mirk thought he was in sl on accident?

im not sure, but i'll check if he was talking in gd anyways and sent it out of the blue hold on


[22-May-20 10:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[22-May-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
Megan was designing people on the sims too


[22-May-20 10:22 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ya so Kyle made her uncomfortable


[22-May-20 10:22 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Which isn’t good at all


[22-May-20 10:22 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Something has to be done


[22-May-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
did Bella give permission to Kyle to design her on the sims?


[22-May-20 10:23 AM] Cooqkie#2809
r kyle and bella friends


[22-May-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
I mean we cant suspend kyle for making a sims character...


[22-May-20 10:24 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Asking now


[22-May-20 10:24 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Stacey it was broadcasted to the entire SL VC


[22-May-20 10:24 AM] stacey#1000
Ik that


[22-May-20 10:24 AM] stacey#1000
Megan did it too and made a sims avatar for kyle


[22-May-20 10:25 AM] stacey#1000
Bella should've told him not to put that shirt on the avatar when it happened


[22-May-20 10:25 AM] stacey#1000
kyle had no way of knowing if Bella said nothing-


[22-May-20 10:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
if kyle and bella are friends then he might have been doing it to be funny without realizing it would offend her


[22-May-20 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
I think Kyle had no way of knowing it offended her if she said nothing to him as it was happening


[22-May-20 10:26 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[22-May-20 10:27 AM] stacey#1000
We literally cannot suspend someone for making a sims avatar


[22-May-20 10:27 AM] stacey#1000
like that is way too strict


[22-May-20 10:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
he probably didnt realize it would offend her


[22-May-20 10:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i dont think he would have done if if he knew it would offend her so


[22-May-20 10:28 AM] stacey#1000
exactly, im saying Bella should've told him and he would've changed it

Is anyone against me shutting down staff lounge


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
It’s clearly leaking so I


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
No*


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] ethan;#0003
I don’t think it would help


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] ethan;#0003
By shutting it down


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
we always shut down staff lounge when someone leaks


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
well we've said that if leaking occurs again it'd result in a shutdown


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
exactly


[22-May-20 01:08 PM] stacey#1000
Emma literally said it when iiachi was fired


[22-May-20 01:09 PM] stacey#1000
So here we are


[22-May-20 01:09 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk we should wait for more people to see


[22-May-20 01:09 PM] ethan;#0003
If they want to shut down

@emma; hi Emma


[22-May-20 01:11 PM] a. ღ#4222

[22-May-20 01:11 PM] stacey#1000

@Tattoblue rat


[22-May-20 01:11 PM] emma;#1525
Answer my pings


[22-May-20 01:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
because idk how we are gonna figure out who it is


[22-May-20 01:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
because we have 0 info


[22-May-20 01:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@emma; i wasnt in the server, MRs were sending those pictures in SL


[22-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
O


[22-May-20 01:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
as that person was speaking


[22-May-20 01:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i could join if they're still at the hotle tho @emma;


[22-May-20 01:19 PM] Cooqkie#2809
do we log ticket blacklisted?


[22-May-20 01:20 PM] emma;#1525
@Tattoblue @stacey sooo i have a sneaking suspicion that this is cinder or meow or someone using a discord plugin OR exploit or something to let them see channels, as they keep mentioning senior channels and all that and i highly doubt any of our seniors would leak?


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
the discord plugins only show hidden channels tho, they cant show who's texting at that exact moment


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
i thought it was a plug-in but u cant see inside of channels?


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
Are they saying who exactly said what


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
but cinder knows a lot about hacking so


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
Or just who talked


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
like bloodtides said "whats happening" then no joke 2 seconds later that person said it in the chat


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
there's a program that lets you see text for servers you ARENT in


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
only the public ones


[22-May-20 01:21 PM] emma;#1525
but im sure cinder could figure out how to bypass channel perms lmao


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
we'll see tho


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
shouldnt we still shutdown SL?


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
Then why aren’t they saying who said what in management lounge and stuff


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] emma;#1525
yeah so what im gonna do is shut down staff lounge slowly by ranks


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[22-May-20 01:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
get rid of one rank at a time


[22-May-20 01:23 PM] stacey#1000
Do you want me to announce this


[22-May-20 01:23 PM] stacey#1000
STAFF LOUNGE SHUTDOWN

Greetings MRs,

Here we are again. Another staff lounge shutdown. The HR team has made it pretty clear about our policies on leaking, and if some of you clearly can’t seem to follow that, then you don’t get the privileges of talking in staff lounge. This channel has been shutdown before, and until we get to the bottom of this, staff lounge will remain closed. I understand this may seem unfair to those of you that have done nothing, but remember when someone leaks it reflects on the whole MR team. This does not mean you can start talking in staff discussion either, as that is to be used only for purpose of what the channel was created for. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to message any member of the HR team. 

Sincerely,
staceyzn

change then to so


[22-May-20 01:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-May-20 01:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then put the comma after so


[22-May-20 01:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-May-20 01:23 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[22-May-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
no


[22-May-20 01:23 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey im not announcing it at all


[22-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
at least not right off the bat


[22-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
i want to wait for the alt account to start leaking in game again


[22-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
and then slowly take perms away


[22-May-20 01:24 PM] emma;#1525
but i dont want to announce it yet


[22-May-20 01:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@stacey i think its good <:


[22-May-20 01:24 PM] stacey#1000
I’m not announcing yet but I have it ready for when I do


[22-May-20 01:25 PM] stacey#1000
Who’s perms you taking first


[22-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so are you going to remove like heads first?


[22-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or


[22-May-20 01:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
are u doing each head rank one at a time


[22-May-20 01:26 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Cooqkie we cant do it by rank because as long as people have the MR team role, they can still see the channel


[22-May-20 01:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[22-May-20 01:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
rip


[22-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
@Tattoblue yes we can lmao


[22-May-20 01:26 PM] emma;#1525
its not hard


[22-May-20 01:27 PM] emma;#1525

@a. ღ she used the betterdiscord plugin to see our VCs


[22-May-20 01:31 PM] a. ღ#4222
oh


[22-May-20 01:31 PM] emma;#1525
but the one she showed had a big lock by it meaning whoever took the photo didnt have access to join it


[22-May-20 01:31 PM] emma;#1525
so it had to be a plugin


[22-May-20 01:31 PM] a. ღ#4222

i think its good tho :D


[22-May-20 01:34 PM] emma;#1525
ok so i changed SL perms around so now they're by rank and not by the MR team role


[22-May-20 01:34 PM] emma;#1525
i gtg shower rq so please keep it open until they start reporting if someone starts to leak again or not


[22-May-20 01:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[22-May-20 01:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think its better if u get rid of "so" and just leave it as then


[22-May-20 01:34 PM] emma;#1525
if in like an hour the leaker still hasnt returned we'll go ahead and shut down for safety reasons anyways


[22-May-20 01:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
ok


[22-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I actually like that idea @emma;


[22-May-20 02:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It sounds really strategic and seems like a way we can get out hands on the leaker

@emma; wouldnt it be harder to not intersect training and ints?


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
i mean it might take an extra second to look at but i dont really think so


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oop i literally didn't mean to type lol @emma;


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
no different than only having one list


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
really


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Ya we should do that


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
but again idc it was just a random thought i had


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Easier for the 7 year olds to read


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya i think it would probably be easier


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
if you all think one is better that's cool


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] Polk#1596
one list because its easier to see the ordee of the sessions


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
it might just be easier for everyone ELSE


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think i'd personally rather keep how it is, but that's just my personal preference


[22-May-20 08:39 PM] emma;#1525
because that way it's less to read between if they're looking for a particular type of session


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
But I can see if we do two lists lots of sessions will overlap


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i mean its not a huge deal if training and ints r at the same time


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
Because it will be harder to tell


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] emma;#1525
not really if we like... pay attention


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] emma;#1525
but again if it's too hard for ur brains then thats fine


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] emma;#1525
im more concerned about the ticket thing tbh


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
my clock is still broken tho lol


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk how to fix it it thinks im PST ;-;


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't have a problem with both solutions, but i prefer the way we do things now


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
Seniors should be allowed to read only talkative role requests


[22-May-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
Nothing else


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but they arent separated anymore?


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey the problem is we don't "do" things now


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk how that would work


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] emma;#1525
we let the tickets get way overloaded


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] emma;#1525
to the point where i know a lot of us get dms every day about not being able to make more tickets


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg we should do ticket sessions


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
jk


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] emma;#1525
so either we all agree to read a lot more or we let some seniors help


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
COOKIE SHUT UP-


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
not enough tickets for that


[22-May-20 08:41 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie wait why is that not a horrible idea

Darren,

The HR team has once again noticed that you have become extremely inactive, even after being given a warning following your previous inactivity watch notice. We are aware that you are resigning soon and believe that you are doing the bare minimum activity as to not lose your position until then, which is absolutely not okay. As of now, you are being placed on inactivity watch again. If you do not get your activity back to the acceptable level within the week, your position will be removed. Your inactivity watch will continue until your planned resignation date, and if your activity drops before that date we will consider demotion as we do not believe you are interested in still working for us and are drawing out your time here. We expect staff members to maintain activity even with planned resignation dates, and seniors are no exception. Please let me know what you will be doing in response to this, whether it is getting your activity back up or moving up your resignation date accordingly. Not replying to this message with your plan will be taken as you not wanting to remain in your position any longer.

Greetings Slee_20,

It has come to the HR team’s attention that you have been inactive for quite some time now, without a valid inactive notice. We understand you work at Stapleton and can be quite busy there, but keep in mind that does not mean you can be inactive at Bloxton, given your current position and have not provided a valid notice. We noticed you have been active within the discord, and have been on ROBLOX on some other games, but we have not seen you attend any sessions or do any shifts. We will provide you with 2 weeks to improve your activity and respond to this letter when you are available to. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message myself or another member of the HR team.

[22-May-20 09:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[22-May-20 09:33 PM] emma;#1525
i mean there's literally nothing to go off of


[22-May-20 09:33 PM] emma;#1525
so shutting down staff lounge wont help us figure out who it is


[22-May-20 09:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
true


[22-May-20 09:33 PM] emma;#1525
everyone knows there's a leaker so its up to them not to be talking about stuff they dont want potentially leaked rn


[22-May-20 09:33 PM] emma;#1525
if y'all still want to shut it down we can


[22-May-20 09:34 PM] emma;#1525
i just dont think it'll help us figure out who it is rn


[22-May-20 09:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think bc theres like


[22-May-20 09:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
barely anything


[22-May-20 09:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if we keep itopen


[22-May-20 09:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it will be easier to know who did it?


[22-May-20 09:38 PM] stacey#1000

darren was the leaker


[22-May-20 10:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
??


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
i doubt that


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
hes been way too inactive to do that


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
i mean its possible


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
then we wouldnt suspect him


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
but i dont think senior stuff was leaked


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i doubt darren leaked


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
and also darren hates meme and stuff


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
and they all dislike him


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
so like there is no way


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the only reason why hes leaving now is cause emma sent him that message lmao


[22-May-20 10:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if not he probably would of continued his inactivity


[22-May-20 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[22-May-20 10:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809

BLOXTON HOTELS MEMES
Bloxton alone is a meme itself, but it can’t stop anyone from making any.

 Let's see how many LR promo diggers write essays as comments in hopes of a HR seeing it. To those of you, IT DOES NOT MATTER!

[23-May-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
I dealt with a raid yesterday


[23-May-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
They’ve been raiding every day


[23-May-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's usually a bunch of people which is not fun


[23-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Yesterday it was bad too


[23-May-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Adida, Rack, Sooty, and a bunch of others


[23-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Sooty was there yesterday with ice and notorious


[23-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000

[23-May-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's usually the really annoying TikTok ones

[23-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000

[23-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
Oh it was rescheduled


[23-May-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
Nvm


[23-May-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; so for the thing where we move the talkative tickets


[23-May-20 02:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wouldnt it be easier to move the non-talkative tickets?


[23-May-20 02:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc theres mostly talkative??


[23-May-20 02:35 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie oh did we approve that


[23-May-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
are you talking about for seniors or just in general


[23-May-20 02:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theres


[23-May-20 02:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
a separate category


[23-May-20 02:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
with talkative tickets in it


[23-May-20 02:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so im assuming theyre being moved there?


[23-May-20 02:36 PM] emma;#1525
i think that’s been there


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya but its like filled with them


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] emma;#1525
we just don’t use it a lot lol


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] emma;#1525
idk that wasn’t me


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i think if we do the senior thing


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
we should just move anything that isnt talkative


[23-May-20 02:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc most is talkative


[23-May-20 02:41 PM] emma;#1525
ya that’s a good idea


[23-May-20 02:42 PM] emma;#1525
we can rename the default category “talkative request” and then make an “other” category


[23-May-20 02:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809

@emma; can I be invited to elmobloopers promo


[24-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
Oomg why do people still think that you can't warn for the same reason twice


[24-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
i dont get it


[24-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
thats literally the point of a 3 warning system


[24-May-20 03:46 PM] emma;#1525
is you give them 3 chances to stop


[24-May-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
Wait people still think that


[24-May-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
It’s just 3 warnings with proper warning format


[24-May-20 03:48 PM] stacey#1000
As long as it’s not a trolling for giving warnings it’s fine


[24-May-20 03:48 PM] emma;#1525
idk why people ever thought you couldnt warn for the same reason in the first place


[24-May-20 03:49 PM] emma;#1525
tbh i really wish we could go to a 1 warning system


[24-May-20 03:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

hire them


[25-May-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn so for the whole "letting seniors do ticket sessions", can we just give them perms to see the tickets and they can go ahead and verify that they have 30 days on each roblox and discord and then we can go through and give the actual role and close the ticket (which is the easy part lol)


[25-May-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
that way you wouldnt have to like change the bot perms or anything and we dont have to give them role giving perms bc i feel like baby and bear dont like that


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes i like that


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
i dont think they should have role giving perms either - risk of abusing by giving access to mr channels and stuff


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
they can do the hard work and leave us the easy work


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
yeah plus giving roles and closing tickets is the easy part LOL


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes!!


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
they can just say "Approved for talkative" or something


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
at the end of each ticket


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
mhm


[25-May-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
and whoever is hosting the session can go through and rank and close


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] emma;#1525
c00l


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] emma;#1525
do u want to announce it or do u want me to


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
you can announce!


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] emma;#1525
ok i'll write it here first


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] emma;#1525
so we can like


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
but question


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] emma;#1525
go over final rules and stufffff


[25-May-20 05:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
support team role gives them access to tickets, so would the HR hosting the ticket session just give them that specific role if they attend then remove it once done?


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
oh i was just gonna add the perm to the ticket channel


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
so they can see the tickets


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
and then remove it


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
afterwards


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
ig


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh that wont work, when a ticket is created, the channel perms change each time


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
so you'd have to change it everytime a new ticket is opened


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
no the category perms


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
sorry


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
you can change perms for a whole category


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
so it should let them see all tickets in the ticket inbox


[25-May-20 05:33 PM] emma;#1525
i can test it tho


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
you can try, im not sure it'll work though cause the channel perms aren't synced with category perms


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
lmk what happens


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
if it doesnt work, we could just give them the support team role and then remove it once done


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn are you on bloo's server


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525
rn


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause im pretty sure the support team role doesnt grant them access to anything else, but i'll check


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
no


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525
o


[25-May-20 05:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
i left like 30 mins ago


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn okay so you were right, they need support role in order to see the channels but that's fine lol we can just have them say "yes" whenever we ask who wants to help and give them the role


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
mhm


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525
and i checked with moody, he can use commands and close the tickets and stuff (although we prob wouldn't have them close tickets since they can't actually give roles)


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525
so everything should be good from that standpoint if you're cool with it


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah support team role gives them admin


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
wait let me rephrase


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525
just for ticket bot right


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
not server admin


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
just ticket bot admin


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525
yeah


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
like for ticket commands


[25-May-20 05:42 PM] emma;#1525
cool


[25-May-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
but just tell them not to use them and its chill


[25-May-20 05:43 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i'll type up an announcement here and let you read it first


[25-May-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
actually


[25-May-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
they can just rename tickets to like reviewed


[25-May-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
and they can close the denied ones


[25-May-20 05:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
that works pretty well actually


[25-May-20 05:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
but that might make things a little more complicated so up to you! and okay


[25-May-20 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
whats the minimum time someone has to be head to be promoted to management these days


[25-May-20 05:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn u have no talent how did u win agt


[25-May-20 05:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
i think the limit we've always had is 1 month but we normally like to wait for people to gain more experience in their head position first to make sure they're ready


[25-May-20 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
and my talent is drinking coffee, obviously!

Ticket Help - sos please thanks

Seniors,

Hopefully you know that we have a ticket bot to help people contact us with things they need, such as requesting the talkative role. With the influx of people we've had since reaching 1 mil, the HRs are struggling to keep up with the tickets since they fill up so fast. So, we would like to ask you guys to help us out every now and again to try and keep the inbox not maxed out.

How this works:

Basically an HR will host a "Ticket Session" (which will be announced in senior announcements on disc) and if you want to help, let the HR know and you will get the "Support Team" role. This will let you access all of our tickets.

What you can review:

At this point, we **only** are allowing you to look at tickets requesting a **talkative role**. You will have access to all of our tickets, but you can ONLY review ones that are for the talkative role.

How to review talkative role requests:

Use the ?Whois and !whois commands on the person who requested the role. They MUST have at least 30 days of age on both their roblox and discord accounts (registration date, not server join date). They also **MUST** be verified already. If they meet our age requirements (and don't have any rule breaking things like an inappropriate roblox user, pfp, etc) you can say "Approved for role." on the ticket and the HR hosting will come through, give them the role, and close the ticket.

If they DO NOT meet the criteria (less than 30 days, rule breaking, etc) or if they have LEFT the server, you may use the **-close** command on the ticket. Include a reason with the following format:   -close Roblox account age is under 30, reapply when you are at 30 days.

To repeat, you may ONLY close tickets that you are **denying** the talkative role to, and you must include the reason for closing those tickets.

This will probably be confusing the first few times so we'll probably limit it to just a few seniors at a time so we can help you all figure it out.


[25-May-20 05:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok


[25-May-20 05:49 PM] emma;#1525

[25-May-20 05:51 PM] emma;#1525
i think 1 month is the standard for any promo but i mean i doubt most of us would approve anything less than 2 months for a management promo


[25-May-20 05:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok


[25-May-20 05:51 PM] xM_inn#2821

what


[25-May-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000

bruh where tf did she hear faris was promoted


[25-May-20 08:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no idea 🤨


[25-May-20 09:01 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey can i archvie the promotion thing for fxllenleave


[25-May-20 09:01 PM] ethan;#0003
because she has some connection to meme


[25-May-20 09:01 PM] ethan;#0003
and has 1 vote


[25-May-20 09:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah


[25-May-20 09:56 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; we can just play after your 1 am session lmao


[25-May-20 09:59 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@stacey he probably told her he did


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
he was legit


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
trying to suck-up to me and beanman


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and basically any MR and HR at bloo’s session


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] stacey#1000
hes literally never getting promoted


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] stacey#1000
he hints all the time


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and tried to make us feel sorry for him just to make us “want” to be “friends” with him


[25-May-20 10:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
He said “ok I’ll just sit alone”


[25-May-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And followed bman and I around


[25-May-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And like beanman is never around anymore I doubt that when he’s with us he wants to be annoyed by people trying to be friends with just MRs and HRs


[25-May-20 10:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I rly hate those ppl it’s kinda petty like make some LRs friends it will make u happier


[25-May-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I feel like they think MR and HR friends = I’m gonna get a promo


[25-May-20 10:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that’s y I don’t like friending LRs bc I think they’re like sucking up to me


[25-May-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
these LRs are testy


[25-May-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
literally so sassy


[25-May-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
i cant be in general discussion for that long bc they all try to like fight me as some sort of power move 😂 like calm ur asses down i will warn and kick you before you get the chance to say cheeseburger


[25-May-20 10:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that ratatouille session was funny


[25-May-20 10:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
also stressful 😰


[25-May-20 10:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but what was funny was when you did the Elmo stuff @emma;


[25-May-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
that was hilarious omg


[25-May-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt intend for it to be that creepy


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
but the four of them chasing people around 😂


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LMAOAOAOA it was funny when they were walking down the street


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And everyone was like OMGGGMGGG


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
i had a diff plan but ig someone brought them early but honestly them walking slowly towards everyone made it so much better


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
fr


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
and then the end with the slowed down elmo song and us praising them in a circle 😂


[25-May-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
i really hope someone recorded

[25-May-20 11:41 PM] ethan;#0003
next shift = quwanterz pls


[25-May-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; we still gotta get through candy and anna 😂


[26-May-20 12:11 AM] stacey#1000
I do think Qwanterz could benefit the team as well as he is active and can help out his timezone a lot but Anna and candy stand out to me more because they are equally active and have been there longer


[26-May-20 12:28 AM] emma;#1525
i mean i agree quwanterz over anna but likeeee i think we all know that if we dont hire candy and anna together we arent hiring anyone 😂


[26-May-20 12:29 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye quwanterz can save asia


[26-May-20 12:32 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
asian timezones r safe


[26-May-20 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
I mean I do think we need someone to help out that timezone.


[26-May-20 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
I guess we will find out next shift vote


[26-May-20 12:32 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's going to be a good one


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
we need someone in asia


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i genuinely like majority of the candidates we have


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
*pretends im not in asia*


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[26-May-20 12:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i do your tickets


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
A part of me thinks Anna and Qwanterz. Or candy and Qwanterz


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
im just tired of interactions in sessions


[26-May-20 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t do tickets a lot


[26-May-20 12:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
my preferences are fraux, anna, candy, and quwanterz


[26-May-20 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
Every time I try doing it my discord hates me


[26-May-20 12:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
those 4 i believe would be solid picks


[26-May-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[26-May-20 12:43 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what about omer. Omer is another good candidate cause if y’all already considering fraux and Omer was promoted in January lol


[26-May-20 12:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I personally don't mind him but he's not really my first option


[26-May-20 12:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I guess he'll be the 5th to be solid


[26-May-20 12:44 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

It isnt bad


[26-May-20 12:02 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But like


[26-May-20 12:02 PM] ethan;#0003
That means there was a charge back

this person is avas friend someway or another


[27-May-20 07:11 PM] ethan;#0003
and submitted the fake proof


[27-May-20 07:11 PM] ethan;#0003
for ava


[27-May-20 07:11 PM] ethan;#0003
to get 2r_i fired


[27-May-20 07:12 PM] ethan;#0003
and i wouldnt be suprised if the same person will also sumbit fake proof for vedom in a few days


[27-May-20 07:12 PM] ethan;#0003
because ava said she was going to do that


[27-May-20 07:15 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey hey


[27-May-20 07:15 PM] ethan;#0003
do u know anyone in the bloxton tea discord server


[27-May-20 07:15 PM] ethan;#0003
or anyone know someone


[27-May-20 07:15 PM] ethan;#0003
in that server who can search and see if any of those three discord accounts are in it


[27-May-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[27-May-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's either Megan or Stacey


[27-May-20 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003

the one im in doesnt have those alts


[27-May-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
is it the one where ava said that?


[27-May-20 08:14 PM] emma;#1525
No


[27-May-20 08:14 PM] emma;#1525
but she's talked about impersonating them in that disc


[27-May-20 08:15 PM] emma;#1525
not photoshopping evidence tho


[27-May-20 08:54 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; that message was about if Ava was trying to claim to be 2r_i, that’s what I meant not to fire him for. I saw actual evidence of him bypassing so like anyone else he was fired for it


[27-May-20 08:54 PM] stacey#1000
Did I think it was a bit odd yes but where is the proof he hasn’t been at the hotel at all?


[27-May-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
He could just be saying that to try to get his rank back. Although if you think it’s photoshop give his rank back your choice


[27-May-20 08:59 PM] ethan;#0003
I 100% think its photoshopped


[27-May-20 08:59 PM] ethan;#0003
It isnt even a full image of the chatlogs


[27-May-20 08:59 PM] ethan;#0003
of the chat box


[27-May-20 09:06 PM] ethan;#0003
Unless it was in another game.


[27-May-20 09:06 PM] ethan;#0003
That wasn't bloxton


[27-May-20 09:16 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey I asked him some questions and showed him the proof, he said he remembers that but it was in another game it was not bloxton


[27-May-20 09:16 PM] ethan;#0003
so im going to give him rank back


[27-May-20 09:16 PM] ethan;#0003
because people shouldnt be reporting someone in non bloxton related games

im going to give the girl who reported him a warning


[27-May-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; there is 0 proof that he’s being honest but ok


[27-May-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
He went from not remembering bypassing to remembering bypassing but defo not at Bloxton


[27-May-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
Sketchy


[27-May-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
i sent him the proof


[27-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and i was able to tell it didnt look like bloxton


[27-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
'


[27-May-20 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
because bloxton doesnt have walls that color brown


[27-May-20 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
He shouldn’t be bypassing in any games as it does break tos


[27-May-20 09:23 PM] ethan;#0003
everyone bypasses


[27-May-20 09:23 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t


[27-May-20 09:23 PM] stacey#1000
But the fact that he lied about bypassing and then remembering when you sent the proof is odd


[27-May-20 09:25 PM] ethan;#0003
He kept saying he "i never bypassed in bloxton"


[27-May-20 09:25 PM] ethan;#0003
So he is saying he did bypass just not in bloxton


[27-May-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
You will have to unban him from the hotel too if you are giving him his rank back


[27-May-20 09:26 PM] ethan;#0003
I did


[27-May-20 09:26 PM] stacey#1000

[28-May-20 04:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no i was caught up with something else @Cooqkie


[28-May-20 05:19 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey what was retro calling hot


[28-May-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
also why was the LR’s name scratched out? Kinda important to know


[28-May-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, so to respond to these:


[28-May-20 05:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) The person's name being scratched out is vqIentiina.


[28-May-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I suggested to Kenzi that I needed their name, and she answered.

@emma;


[28-May-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2) I think Holly is the LR's name, I'm interviewing her right now about it, so I'll update you if that's the case.


[28-May-20 05:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fuck the person I was asking for info went offline

[28-May-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003
that would mean we would also need to host more trainings


[28-May-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003
because of more trainees


[28-May-20 06:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
correct but you also no more apps reading


[28-May-20 06:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
and no intervirws


[28-May-20 06:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
much easier


[28-May-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003
o


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
idk


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
wait how would it work though


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm going to say no tbh


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
i feel like it wouldnt go well


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] ethan;#0003
would there be the automated app thing and interviews? or just the automated app thing


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
now that would be fun


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
only problem is


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
automated quiz center


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
interviews alongside if you wish


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
(just an idea)


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
we'd get so many bad trainees


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
at training


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats the only downside


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
ok here is what I say about it


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah that's my issue


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
Boho salon did something like this


[28-May-20 06:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we usually get them anyways but like


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
and they took it down because it backfired


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
people would literally fail trainings cause they wont know grammar 😂


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
unless the questions are consistantly changed because then one youtube video and then everyone can pass with 0 grammar


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
it backfired because it was really easy for people to get a job and much easier for trollers to get a job


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
i got a better suggestion


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
trollers will get the job so easily ya


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] Cam#5887
don’t want that no


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
a rank bot !!


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think them having their own answers makes more sense


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Beartikal


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
so now boho salon only does interviews


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] Cam#5887
cause


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] Cam#5887
i like apps


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
I like apps but just update the questions I gave you


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
fix the application rank bot :thumbsUp:


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
i like apps but i think yall should only have them open on weekends


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
rip 5 people disagreed


[28-May-20 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
we def need new questions


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
stacey didn't we finish them


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
it was just a suggestion for modern easier process but your right about the trollers part


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
yes bear has the questions


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we need that ranking bot back that we used to have


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but then it broke


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] ethan;#0003
And people with no grammar would pass


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
rip


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
Stacey send me the questions and I can update it noe


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
i just dont want the same thing that happened to boho salon to happen to this group


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
is it possible to have a new one @Beartikal


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like a new ranking bot


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
rank bot!


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
i said that trey


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no one cares bonnie


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
get out of my sight


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
i could try one that ranks via a command in game I guess u could


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
QI) How did you discover Bloxton Hotels?

QII) Why are you interested in working at Bloxton Hotels? (Provide II+ detailed sentences) 

QIII) What are some goals you have planned for the group?
 
QIV) What skills do you have that will benefit you working here? (Provide II+ detailed sentences.)

 QV) What III words best describe you and your personality?


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it’s boring having to rank from application


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
also bear


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
all it is is click click click


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
repeat


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
we should have something that people can check their statu


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
s


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
app status


[28-May-20 06:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
dk why this center doesn't already have that but ok


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
would it be possible if like when we put a passed app in a passed list that the bot ranks them


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but what bot are you going to use


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
terabyte is obsolete


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes Stacey we used to have that


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
are you essentially going to create ur own @Beartikal


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but then the bot broke and it was never fixed


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oops @Beartikal *


[28-May-20 06:18 PM] stacey#1000

[28-May-20 06:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
we should sell ranks, like instant staff for 10 robux, head security for 100 robux.. bod for 1000 robux.. and chairman for 2000 robux

@High Rank


[29-May-20 01:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
hey, can a retired HR come back as a lower rank?


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
didnt we have a rule or something about this


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
not many come back so i cant remember


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lower rank as in like an LR?


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] stacey#1000
they use to be able to come back as management


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's been taken off ages ago lol


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey yeah that ruke


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
what happened to it


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] stacey#1000
idk I wasnt an HR when that rule was changed


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
We got rid of it since September 2018


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
We don’t do it anymore


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah


[29-May-20 01:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It’s been gone for a while


[29-May-20 01:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was announced on staff announcements I think


[29-May-20 01:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm kind of glad it ain't back tbh


[29-May-20 01:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Working for it is much more entertaining


[29-May-20 01:25 AM] stacey#1000
I think it was because of other MRs that found it unfair because when an MR resigns they cannot come back and get their rank back they have to earn it


[29-May-20 01:25 AM] stacey#1000
and we shouldnt give others special treatment like that


[29-May-20 01:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Remember the saab conversation lol


[29-May-20 01:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
We got sooo much shit for that and I'm not trying to relive that


[29-May-20 01:26 AM] stacey#1000
I mean if it was an LR rank maybe it would be fine


[29-May-20 01:26 AM] stacey#1000
but like an MR rank no


[29-May-20 01:26 AM] Tattoblue#5828
agreed ^


[29-May-20 01:26 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I rather just have them do the sessions to be fair


[29-May-20 01:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause they usually take 2 hours in total


[29-May-20 01:27 AM] stacey#1000
it doesnt bother me if they get an LR rank


[29-May-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
also +1 for me because cyto actually didnt quit when i free ranked flamingo to LR for a game promotion deal
**i still think i did nothing wrong btw*


[29-May-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
but you guys dont approve so i stopped ⚔️


[29-May-20 01:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

flamingos content is great


[29-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
He had a chance I think lmao before


[29-May-20 01:28 AM] stacey#1000
he is not even banned anymore and he made a new video saying he was still banned but then he didnt even actually try joining the game


[29-May-20 01:28 AM] ethan;#0003
Didn’t he come back 2 times?


[29-May-20 01:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[29-May-20 01:28 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But he was inactive 💀 idk if he left again or if he was removed from position


[29-May-20 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760

[29-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Probably removed


[29-May-20 01:29 AM] ethan;#0003
If it’s just an LR rank that’s fine I’d say


[29-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
If he was


[29-May-20 01:29 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Good


[29-May-20 01:29 AM] ethan;#0003

[29-May-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
@High Rank uhh guys some are verified but cant access the discord


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
idk why


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
they need talkative role


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause they need talkative


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
they have to make a ticket for it


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] emma;#1525
ya


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
didnt know that


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
by saying -new Talkative role in verification


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] emma;#1525
bc a lot of people make new accounts just to troll


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
it says MAX tickets


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] emma;#1525
so we verify they have a not new account age


[29-May-20 02:04 AM] emma;#1525
ya we have an influx of people joining bc of 1m


[29-May-20 02:05 AM] emma;#1525
so sometimes we get behind BUT we're improving it


[29-May-20 02:05 AM] stacey#1000
what even is the max for talkative role tickets


[29-May-20 02:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[29-May-20 11:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
okay so heres my opinions on the document


[29-May-20 11:08 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm in the censorship section so far


[29-May-20 11:09 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is it me or is there a lack of proof over the person of the retired role


[29-May-20 11:09 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The way it's described is very similar to our group at one point


[29-May-20 11:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
i'd rather wait to see their public statement before doing anything else

most of the evidence inside of the document is either leaked or doesn't concern bloxton; meaning we shouldn't take action for those parts as it isn't of our concern

the only things that concern me are the following, though the third image looks false/edited:

https://gyazo.com/cdb4fc4bc7080ff6ea41a1ce87af187c

https://gyazo.com/2ab7a05ba101adff373dbf0c1647203d

https://gyazo.com/8395a03bd48982decb843e8c0eee7a87

in summary, this seems like toxic former mrs/hrs targeting boba. no group is perfect and if anything, boba should only be warned, for the above images i've posted. but once again, i would much rather wait for a public statement to gather their side of the story. that's all from me for now.


[29-May-20 11:10 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Speaking of the hangout server, they also don’t allow any formers who are deemed toxic, which could be seen as unfair by some people, as it is a hangout server for the former staff and current ones after all. Doesn’t that seem quite biased?"


[29-May-20 11:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Um that sounds pretty fair to me 💀


[29-May-20 11:11 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Part of me thinks they're either trash talking or leaking info


[29-May-20 11:14 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"The discord is meant to be a place where everyone feels welcomed, I’m sure I am not the only one who gets disturbed if the own Vice President “twerks” and more, even if it’s a joke. Yes, it may have been the trolling simulation of a training, but there is a level of decency you can show. Since the MR+ ranked staff are role models to the LRs, they’ll also do these types of things in order to fit in."

@xM_inn given how much we get exposed and our allies don’t really care I feel like we can do the same for boba lol I didn’t read the doc but as long as they aren’t like literally treating their staff like shit idc


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
ye


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I read the entire document


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
apparently most of the stuff in there is outdated or out of context anyways


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It basically has problems of our original tea doc


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
that third screenshot you posted minn, the online dating thing, 100% fake I bet


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Probably using that bot


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
it doesnt really concern us and isnt all too major


[29-May-20 12:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
yea emma


[29-May-20 12:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not much context, biased opinions, and it feels quite exaggerated


[29-May-20 12:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The part where they get to a former member


[29-May-20 12:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I feel like they were genuinely toxic but didn't want to say anything


[29-May-20 12:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@xM_inn Ya just seems like drama, nothing too troublesome

if so, then its a good job we switched verification bots a while ago

[29-May-20 01:30 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey do you want me to set  up the channels


[29-May-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[29-May-20 01:30 PM] emma;#1525
gonna make a separate text channel for it too


[29-May-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
But don’t open them for everyone to join until like 10 minutes until it starts


[29-May-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[29-May-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
Do you think we need slow mode too?


[29-May-20 01:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
isnt it normally at


[29-May-20 01:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
15 seconds


[29-May-20 01:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[29-May-20 01:31 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I think so


[29-May-20 01:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
15-20 i think


[29-May-20 01:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc u dont want someone to spam the same question


[29-May-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah and we want HRs to be able to answer questions too. Like you can answer questions in the text channel too


[29-May-20 01:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[29-May-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey channel is live


[29-May-20 01:52 PM] stacey#1000
ok im in it now


[29-May-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
idk if you were planning on letting MRs speak but you'll have to give them individual permissions in the channel


[29-May-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
so best not to do more than 1-2


[29-May-20 01:53 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank the Q&A channel is live if any of you were gonna attend


[29-May-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
I may not but we will see


[29-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
it depends on how it goes


[29-May-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
while we are answering questions no

[29-May-20 05:25 PM] Cam#5887
yeah that was pretty damn rude


[29-May-20 05:25 PM] Cam#5887
but did jessie ever tell the MR that they are hurting her feelings about her voice?


[29-May-20 05:25 PM] Cam#5887
@katie


[29-May-20 05:26 PM] Cam#5887
cause the first step would to say stop, but like i get she was being rude overall


[29-May-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's kind of fucked up- @katie


[29-May-20 05:26 PM] Cam#5887
yeah it’s fucked lmao


[29-May-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[29-May-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're supposed to be a team


[29-May-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so this is really concerning to me


[29-May-20 05:27 PM] Cam#5887
actually there was no way for jessie to tell her to stop because she kept blocking her


[29-May-20 05:27 PM] Cam#5887
so that’s another thing


[29-May-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't find this really acceptable


[29-May-20 05:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but i think it makes sense for me to discuss this with her and receive a warning


[29-May-20 05:35 PM] katie#0200
yeah, that's what i was thinking


[29-May-20 05:36 PM] katie#0200
i don't think she did but apparently she cant rlly contact her because she's blocked her @Cam


[29-May-20 05:36 PM] Cam#5887
exactly


[29-May-20 05:36 PM] katie#0200
i mean she could say something in a mutual discord server but im sure she wants to keep this in dms


[29-May-20 05:36 PM] Cam#5887
yeah 100 percent a warning


[29-May-20 05:36 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[29-May-20 05:37 PM] Cam#5887
it’s just not right


[29-May-20 05:37 PM] Cam#5887
for a (what trey said) a team to be acting like this


[29-May-20 05:37 PM] Cam#5887
and it’s quite irritating since they should all be working together


[29-May-20 05:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok im waiting on luhvenderr's response atm

thats just a teleport exploit on a jetski


[29-May-20 10:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
also give "helpmefindmyaccount0" his job back ipremitted him to work seperate stations


[29-May-20 10:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
so if he was fired for that then undo the action


[29-May-20 10:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman


[29-May-20 10:36 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal did u also give them perms to not use grammar lol


[29-May-20 10:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bear bman can’t use discord anymore he won’t see that lol


[29-May-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal bman wants you to talk to him on his card on the HR board bc he's salty he doesnt get to replace his tickets with something else on the pay checklist even tho he does like 0 work but i told him i'd ask you to talk to him so


[29-May-20 11:58 PM] ethan;#0003
why would bman get that but not mack


[29-May-20 11:59 PM] ethan;#0003
mack does all the tickets


[29-May-20 11:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
?


[30-May-20 12:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye do i get bonus for clearing over 140 tickets


[30-May-20 12:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
?


[30-May-20 12:04 AM] emma;#1525
i think its ridiculous that bman is allowed to do nothing like this LOL and he's complaining about not being paid enough when legit he gets help with almost everything he does but


[30-May-20 12:04 AM] emma;#1525
i was annoyed of him bitching at me on his card so i told him i'd tag bear


[30-May-20 12:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
tell him to clear 50 tickets daily


[30-May-20 12:04 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
tyyyyyyy


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack he cant he's not on discord!!!


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
so he should get paid for something the rest of us *dont* get paid for


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
to make up for it


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
or something


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
lol


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait is he bitching because we don't really tell him decisions that occur on dc @emma;


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
like what


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
admin acts


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack you should have seniors help you with tickets it goes by so fast


[30-May-20 12:07 AM] emma;#1525
i have no idea bc i asked him 3 times what he wanted to replace them with and he just kept bitching about how its unfair we dont contact him about every little thing we talk about here instead of actually answering my questions


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
nah dont really trust seniors


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i rather do them myself


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so much faster than bans


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
o ive had them help twice and they're not bad at it


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
new ticket head


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
sometimes they approve unverified people but its not that common


[30-May-20 12:08 AM] emma;#1525
i dont count seniors doing tickets on my checklist tho so no money for me LOL maybe i should do them on my own more


[30-May-20 12:09 AM] emma;#1525
but im sick of being tagged all the time about how tickets are full 🙄 people have no patience


[30-May-20 12:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i clear them at around 7pm sgt daily


[30-May-20 12:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so ppl got to wait since im the only one


[30-May-20 12:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but im leaving appeals to you guys tho


[30-May-20 12:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause i suck at them


[30-May-20 12:09 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
@emma; sir!! tickets are full!!!!


[30-May-20 12:10 AM] emma;#1525
o i never do appeals lol


[30-May-20 12:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-May-20 12:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-May-20 12:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and see how many tickets ive been doing


[30-May-20 12:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i can just share with him some 🙂


[30-May-20 12:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so he still gets paid :)))


[30-May-20 12:16 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but bman doesn’t rly host anymore?


[30-May-20 12:16 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I liked randomly coming to his sessions :<


[30-May-20 12:17 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I don’t rly see him on roblox anymore


[30-May-20 12:17 AM] Cooqkie#2809
One time he came to a banning session with me but I think that’s bc I told him I was there lol


[30-May-20 12:18 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok ima sleep gnnn

[30-May-20 12:40 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
be nice to him oks


[30-May-20 12:40 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hes coming back


[30-May-20 12:40 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
like in idk how long


[30-May-20 12:40 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
dont let him search his name


[30-May-20 12:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
I understand he doesnt have access to discord and that's impacting discussions with him but like that isnt our fault, he's the one without Discord and we're helping when and where we can. He was lucky to keep his HR rank without Discord in the first place due to the halt it'd have on communication.  Little disrespectful but eh.


[30-May-20 12:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't like how salty he's acting tbh


[30-May-20 12:42 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn how long will he be allowed to continue this


[30-May-20 12:42 AM] emma;#1525
out of curiosity


[30-May-20 12:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't really care if he sees this, im not liking the attitude


[30-May-20 12:42 AM] emma;#1525
because to me it seemed like he has 0 interest of even trying to get discord back anytime soon and wants us to pretend he's just at camp (but he's not so)


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
"act like im at camp" while simultaneously complaining he's not getting any info... as if he'd get any at camp LOL


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
Idk that generally depends on baby and bear since they approved it, but if hes gonna start being salty and disrespectful over it then its not going to end well or look good for him


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
but then complains about him not being involved..?


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
if this goes on for another month and he's not even trying to come back we need to have a discussion about it bc it's kind of ridiculous


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
i totally understand he got spooked bc he was doxxed


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
He seems interested in the robux more than anything LOL


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
but i mean cam got doxxed too and he didn't just leave


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] emma;#1525
yeah i thought that was funny LOL


[30-May-20 12:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean cam called the authorities


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i find it really weird tho


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
he basically did the polar opposite of what bman did


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
Bman if ur reading this in the future, no hate


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn "i want my tickets to be replaced with something else bc its not fair" "okay bman let me know what and i can pass it on, but baby and bear said no to admin acts" "well i cant even do tickets it so unfair you guys involve me in nothing" "what do you want to be involved in" "literally no one even says hi to me like they've all forgotten me"


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
was the entire convo


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] emma;#1525
that we had


[30-May-20 12:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[30-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
he's not even hosting sessions


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
and when he does, stacey does most of the work for him


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
bc he can't mod second servers or rank


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] babymariobebe#7563
honestly unpopular opinion but groups with fun game types like the 1970s are bad because they force you to join the group to even play most of the times and if you're late you can't play and they make you spend robux for a dumb late pass


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] babymariobebe#7563
like bruh


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's basically asking for more pay for things he barely does now


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe I AGREE


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] babymariobebe#7563
its so dumb


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
why tf do they SLOCK YOU OUT and make you join their group


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] emma;#1525
its such a scam


[30-May-20 12:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
Very random baby


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
games like that will never get popular


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
let me play the game without joining the group


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
i legit will join then leave


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
it won't end well


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
the 'community' aspect chokes the games' only chance of success


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
and most of the time the games aren't even ran well


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
its really not smart


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] emma;#1525
their mods dont know what tf they're doing


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah


[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:46 AM] xM_inn#2821

[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:48 AM] xM_inn#2821

[30-May-20 12:48 AM] emma;#1525

16? dang thats too old to be falling for social engineering tho


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
They turned out really successful


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] babymariobebe#7563
like you just gotta be smart about those sort of things


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
apparently his "friend" got in on it and helped trick him or something


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
but like a sketchy link is a sketchy link


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] emma;#1525
lol


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] babymariobebe#7563
never trust anybody as a friend you didnt meet irl unless you really know them


[30-May-20 12:51 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525

[30-May-20 12:52 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525
then are surprised when their "boyfriend" doxxes them


[30-May-20 12:52 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:52 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[30-May-20 12:52 AM] emma;#1525

Did guys talk to Tsunami already or do you want me to talk to them? I've talked to the owner before about exploits, so I can always shoot her another DM. @stacey @ethan;


[30-May-20 06:12 AM] Polk#1596
bear is going to ditch us to become a vice chairman at sizzle 😔


[30-May-20 06:36 AM] Polk#1596
Hi, I know you guys talk in VCs sometimes, so does this sound interesting to you? I would do it myself, but as you know, I don't really talk in VCs. I think it would be really cool to get interviewed by a Roblox TV brand, although it is a small community. @Bloo_Berriez @Cam @emma; @ethan; @stacey @Tattoblue @xAfroTrey @RAMMGaming  https://gyazo.com/31c83ac7bd2091a6f01190230ac8d93b

[30-May-20 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
@Polk what exactly would they be interviewing us for? Like our jobs here at Bloxton?


[30-May-20 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 movie is 2-4pm est.


[30-May-20 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
Although it may go a bit later it depends when I start it. It may start a bit later then 2


[30-May-20 11:19 AM] emma;#1525
@Polk that seems like more of a baby and bear thing?


[30-May-20 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
I would be fine with them interviewing me but i think we would need permission from baby and bear, but they also should be the ones interviewed as it’s their group.


[30-May-20 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
Idk exactly what they would interview me for so


[30-May-20 11:22 AM] emma;#1525
If it’s a live interview idk if I’m down for that lol


[30-May-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah idk either like idk what they would interview me for


[30-May-20 11:26 AM] emma;#1525
If we can get the questions in advance then I’d be okay doing it


[30-May-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
Same here. I would also like to have someone do it with me. Like if Emma did it with me I would be fine with that

@Cooqkie it’s not promised to be perfect.  There is a lot of people in it and it also depends on your own internet connection

these are all from clarity


[30-May-20 02:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809
this LR was trying to bribe her to share her account


[30-May-20 02:00 PM] stacey#1000
Bruh I’m not risking my pc breaking for a movie event I legit had to force quit everything from people trying to lag people out


[30-May-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
So now people get banned if they add reactions.


[30-May-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[30-May-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i had to restart mine twice


[30-May-20 02:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc it wouldnt restart


[30-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
Well this is their last chance if they spam reactions again, etc no more movie events unless it’s MR+. Doesn’t bother me if I don’t host a movie event it just shows people don’t want them


[30-May-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
It’s fine rn


[30-May-20 02:10 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@stacey u think suspension for the pics i sent above?


[30-May-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I’m never hosting a movie event again too many cbs abuse it and spam the chat. I’ll keep it for MRs only


[30-May-20 02:16 PM] stacey#1000

This one guy is still spamming the chat and for some reason won’t let anyone ban him


[30-May-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
So now mods are just deleting his spam chats

[30-May-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
I think the best thing is for Jessie to block her


[30-May-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
And ofc not give her access to her acc


[30-May-20 02:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[30-May-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000

Lxmcnade | Head of security | May 30th - August 20th | Major exam coming up. If I don't pass it my parents will probably kill me, It'll be best if I take some time off and study.


[30-May-20 10:49 PM] bman#0435
3 months of inactivity for an exam...?


[30-May-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[30-May-20 11:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[30-May-20 11:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Idk any tests that are during summer


[30-May-20 11:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Unless she’s taking a driving test but 3 months is overkill for that


[30-May-20 11:21 PM] Beartikal#9760

[30-May-20 11:21 PM] Beartikal#9760

I'm liking his guide so far @katie


[31-May-20 09:45 AM] katie#0200
same


[31-May-20 10:35 AM] bman#0435
y do we need 2 helper guides doe


[31-May-20 11:03 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@katie I noticed on the security one that he has 10-12 trivia questions


[31-May-20 11:03 AM] Cooqkie#2809
But he doesn’t say to only pick 5


[31-May-20 11:03 AM] Cooqkie#2809
So if we let him use it then he should probably add that


[31-May-20 11:21 AM] bman#0435
o wait nvm i forgot kenzi isnt an mr anymore loool


[31-May-20 11:21 AM] bman#0435
ya i like how his guide is, its not too much information but not too little


[31-May-20 11:22 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'd definitely say bex's guide is the better of out of the two


[31-May-20 11:22 AM] bman#0435
we shouldnt even be using kenzis anymore lol who knows what shell do with it now

ya i was gonna say that too^


[31-May-20 01:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah that's what i think too


[31-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
if they wanna online date on other games I don’t care


[31-May-20 01:12 PM] emma;#1525
it’s stupid but their choice


[31-May-20 01:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

exactly my point bman


[31-May-20 06:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it should be unofficial


[31-May-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
we dont need an official one


[31-May-20 06:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
There's not really a difference to it anyways


[31-May-20 06:48 PM] ethan;#0003
it should stay unofficial


[31-May-20 06:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't get me wrong


[31-May-20 06:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's helpful as fuck


[31-May-20 06:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But I think having it unofficial is the best option


[31-May-20 06:49 PM] katie#0200
yup that's what i was thinking


[31-May-20 06:49 PM] emma;#1525
Can we make it "unofficially" official


[31-May-20 06:49 PM] emma;#1525
like announce it as a resource but not require it


[31-May-20 06:50 PM] emma;#1525
kind of like our training guides, they're technically official but not mandatory


[31-May-20 06:50 PM] emma;#1525
I don't see why we can't at least have it up with our training guides for people to use if they'd like


[31-May-20 06:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't see why not


[31-May-20 06:51 PM] katie#0200
oh yeah that sounds decent


[31-May-20 06:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Oh yeah and also
