[01-Jan-21 11:43 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Well, unless its through a authorized seller


[01-Jan-21 11:44 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But i doubt theres any authorized seller or robux


[01-Jan-21 11:44 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But theres authorized sellers of roblox redeem cards


[01-Jan-21 11:49 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmmm maybe there are robux redeem cards, ive never seen one


[01-Jan-21 11:50 AM] cory!#8287
can you get in trouble for it? cause the dude that asked the question said he wants to report an MR for it but idk if its that major


[01-Jan-21 11:55 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Prob should get them to give you the name and make a hr announcement according to it


[01-Jan-21 11:55 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Just for other opinions


[01-Jan-21 11:57 AM] emily#4444
@lyss me or cory can mod cats server if u want since we're going there anyway


[01-Jan-21 11:58 AM] lyss#0709
ok that works ty! @emily


[01-Jan-21 11:59 AM] emily#4444
okay np!!


[01-Jan-21 12:18 PM] cory!#8287
@katie i think we should give her the same consequences as kylie cause she basically did similar things to what kylie did and to add on leaked an MRs IP address


[01-Jan-21 12:26 PM] katie#0200
yeah exactly


[01-Jan-21 12:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
that was before he was an mr and i dont honestly care either


[01-Jan-21 12:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They waited til after jack got promoted?


[01-Jan-21 12:34 PM] cory!#8287
yeah ig


[01-Jan-21 12:54 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! we’ve had other MRs in the past do that and we have never done anything on it cause usually what ends up happening is their account gets banned by roblox and that is their punishment


[01-Jan-21 12:54 PM] stacey#1000
We cannot do much


[01-Jan-21 12:55 PM] cory!#8287
alrighty


[01-Jan-21 01:00 PM] ethan;#0003
@cory! people buy off those websites all the time the only thing they are putting at risk is there account being banned


[01-Jan-21 01:03 PM] cory!#8287
okay

@Polk bear said he will make it so that the seniors can rank the passers from in the game


[01-Jan-21 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
from a rank command


[01-Jan-21 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
!rank


[01-Jan-21 01:27 PM] Polk#1596
ohhh


[01-Jan-21 01:27 PM] Polk#1596
well im lazy so


[01-Jan-21 01:27 PM] ethan;#0003
me too


[01-Jan-21 01:27 PM] ethan;#0003
😂


[01-Jan-21 01:27 PM] Polk#1596
lets have them do the command thing for us, then when bear implements that its even better LOL


[01-Jan-21 01:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yas I was thinking that


[01-Jan-21 01:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
But yeah rank command


[01-Jan-21 01:33 PM] Fraux#7971
@Polk im confused

#bot_commands


[01-Jan-21 01:41 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder is it possible to give managers mod when they join trainings and all MRs mod when they join interviews so then we don’t have to leave the server to mod or if we can’t get in our own server managers have mod already to kick 1-2 people to allow us in


[01-Jan-21 01:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, one of you guys should log into HH admin and do a session

Best to have him at 14 tho cuz if one of us abuses or gets hacked then any gm+ can demote the bot


[01-Jan-21 04:29 PM] Polk#1596
am i allowed to tell the seniors we use the bot for ranking now @Beartikal


[01-Jan-21 04:29 PM] Polk#1596
we introduced a new format (the bot format) for whenever they log passers as a temp solution for saving time, but they are realllyyyyy curious as to how it speeds up the process

Greetings **GalaxyPixelZ**,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as **Head of Security** from Bloxton Hotels as of **January 1st, 2021, at 5:46 PM EST**. The reasoning behind your termination is due to **leaking confidential MR information**. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

*Signed,*

**cvoryy**
**Shift Manager**
**Bloxton Hotels**

[01-Jan-21 04:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
😢


[01-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
that took us a solid 30 minutes to explain it to them


[01-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
i mean explain it to holly


[01-Jan-21 04:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah


[01-Jan-21 04:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i mean its not that different


[01-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Polk#1596
ikr, i would prefer it this way if i was a senior!


[01-Jan-21 05:00 PM] lyss#0709
@cory! did he respond


[01-Jan-21 05:00 PM] cory!#8287

[01-Jan-21 05:00 PM] cory!#8287
cause hes eest i think


[01-Jan-21 05:00 PM] lyss#0709
ah okay


[01-Jan-21 05:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I asked Management lounge how the CB rule being removed was treating them


[01-Jan-21 05:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and right now i see positive response


[01-Jan-21 05:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
hey guys


[01-Jan-21 05:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
currently, the !pass command works at the Training Center/Interview Center for Heads+
i'm planning on adding it so that when you specify that they passed, they will be auto-ranked and a checkmark appears above their head when they can leave the game.


[01-Jan-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
Ooo


[01-Jan-21 05:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
Should this functionality be restricted to ensure at least 1 Senior+ is in the game, or should heads be given this permission as they are right now.


[01-Jan-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
I think only seniors+ should be given the permission to actually like rank them that way


[01-Jan-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
Considering 1 head legit just got fired for leaking I don’t trust heads


[01-Jan-21 05:42 PM] Polk#1596
i guess heads+ can pass them but seniors would have to do the rank part


[01-Jan-21 05:42 PM] Polk#1596
like clicking their name on the passer board or something


[01-Jan-21 05:42 PM] Polk#1596
but idk how much work that would be


[01-Jan-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
Also since we are talking about training and Interviews is it possible for managers to get mod when they join trainings so we don’t have to mod them


[01-Jan-21 05:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
at all times or only when you initiate it?


[01-Jan-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
At all times when they join trainings


[01-Jan-21 05:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah thats just a matter of editing the admin script


[01-Jan-21 05:43 PM] ethan;#0003
i wouldnt trust heads with the ranking command


[01-Jan-21 05:43 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe managers


[01-Jan-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
Cause the last 2 days I’ve hosted I couldn’t get in my server and managers could only slock it and since the manager had no mod They couldn’t kick someone


[01-Jan-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
If we have to mod them anyways it would be helpful if they jsut auto get mod like seniors at trainings


[01-Jan-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
For interviews idk same thing


[01-Jan-21 05:45 PM] Polk#1596
that would also prevent the issue when modding people at interviews where trollers have usernames like polkinol instead of polkinolk to get mod


[01-Jan-21 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
True


[01-Jan-21 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
it would also save time from having to leave and go mod other servers


[01-Jan-21 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
how would you guys like the ranking to work at the centers?
A) Merge with !pass command so it auto-ranks when a senior+ uses this command
B) new !rank command to use after !pass
C) Button on username that reads "Rank" on the board


[01-Jan-21 05:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
or D) other


[01-Jan-21 05:46 PM] Polk#1596
personally one click would be easier


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Polk#1596
since i assume you would have to write their whole username out if it was !rank


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
I like option c the best


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill do that


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] katie#0200
Ya C sounds good


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Polk#1596
so yes option C


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmm


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but wait


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
oh nvm


[01-Jan-21 05:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
C sounds good

[01-Jan-21 05:50 PM] Polk#1596

[01-Jan-21 05:50 PM] Polk#1596

[01-Jan-21 05:51 PM] Polk#1596

does anyone have a session soon on TC


[01-Jan-21 09:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
id like to test the new in-game ranking


[01-Jan-21 09:50 PM] cory!#8287
lyss does


[01-Jan-21 09:50 PM] cory!#8287
in 10 minutes


[01-Jan-21 09:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
the servers are old though so thats kinda an issue so maybe the next one


[01-Jan-21 09:51 PM] cory!#8287
oh oof


[01-Jan-21 09:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Removed, good spot sir


[01-Jan-21 09:55 PM] cory!#8287
:D


[01-Jan-21 09:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
also i fixed the handcuff exploit at the TC


[01-Jan-21 09:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
as long as you were rank Security the script let you cuff without actual "cuff" tool


[01-Jan-21 09:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
they found that out and abused it


[01-Jan-21 10:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
NOTE: using former MR to test ranking in TC, dont be alarmed


[01-Jan-21 10:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
@High Rank Autoranking in TC will work in next session. Seniors+ can simply click on the name in the board to rank the user, depending on what they were passed to. If they are not senior+ they will just see the option to remove them from passing, like how it is currently.


[01-Jan-21 10:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
a button reads "RANK"


[01-Jan-21 10:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
It will tell them to leave the game and that they are ranked, and will notify you if successful.


[01-Jan-21 10:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
If unsuccessful, try again, or if they left the game, rank manually.


[01-Jan-21 10:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
😮


[01-Jan-21 10:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Do u wanna make an announcement to the seniors


[01-Jan-21 10:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
I can if u don't


[01-Jan-21 10:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
sure


[01-Jan-21 10:46 PM] cory!#8287
nice


[01-Jan-21 10:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
hey guys with the ranking bot should attendance still be tracked


[01-Jan-21 10:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
from TC


[01-Jan-21 10:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
idk why you guys track it but apparently you do


[01-Jan-21 10:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
We don't really use it for anything important like we used to but it gives us an idea on the last session an mr hosted if we are looking to see if they are inactive


[01-Jan-21 10:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 10:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
so still track attendance


[01-Jan-21 11:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
also should any trello cards or anything be created when ranking is successful / unsuccessful? @bonnie591


[01-Jan-21 11:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
right now it just ranks and thats it


[01-Jan-21 11:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Would it be possible to have like a log channel here or something for it. If possible, maybe there could be a button the host uses to get attendance and it lists the names of the Mrs in a channel here instead of trello


[01-Jan-21 11:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u could include lrs too that would be great as it would help with promos


[01-Jan-21 11:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Also this could be a problem cuz a lot of people retrain

#rank-logs


[01-Jan-21 11:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Is it possible to get rid of that since if we don't then we still have to rank like half the people who train and it kinds defeats the purpose of this


[01-Jan-21 11:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oo nice


[01-Jan-21 11:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
want me to allow seniors to shift LRs ranks via this system


[01-Jan-21 11:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can remove the bar


[01-Jan-21 11:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah


[01-Jan-21 11:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 11:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think make it so it doesn't allow if they are Mr cuz Mrs can't retrain


[01-Jan-21 11:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
But allow it for lrs sure


[01-Jan-21 11:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
k


[01-Jan-21 11:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
But yeah would it be possible in the future to have a button that records the names of the rank 4+ in the server and if that's not possible cuz too many people then the rank 8+?


[01-Jan-21 11:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can do that where would you want it to go


[01-Jan-21 11:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Possible a discord channel here


[01-Jan-21 11:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Like something like #Attendance-logs


[01-Jan-21 11:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok.


[01-Jan-21 11:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
when is "attendance" qualified


[01-Jan-21 11:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
surely just joining and leaving isn't attendance


[01-Jan-21 11:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well it's usually heads that help out for the session


[01-Jan-21 11:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
For lrs it would be harder to measure since we kick them for excess


[01-Jan-21 11:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
But it would be nice to honor those who don't get picked as often


[01-Jan-21 11:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
So maybe like we could have two stages in the session where we log it


[01-Jan-21 11:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
One before we kick excess


[01-Jan-21 11:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
One before we end


[01-Jan-21 11:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
To show who helped out and who got kicked for excess


[01-Jan-21 11:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
are you looking for a date tagged with the attendance


[01-Jan-21 11:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
right


[01-Jan-21 11:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah so we can look back when we are considering Demotions for inactivity


[01-Jan-21 11:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
But the discord message would probabaly show the date


[01-Jan-21 11:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
so it looks like they create these cards but what do u guys do with them before archived

[01-Jan-21 11:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
or are they used for data keeping


[01-Jan-21 11:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
We rank and archive. The way we check if a head is inactive is by using the trello search bar and inputting their username to see the most recent card they were mentioned on


[01-Jan-21 11:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
ook


[01-Jan-21 11:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
would you prefer to use trello for this or discord log channel


[01-Jan-21 11:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can automate both


[01-Jan-21 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
Discord log channel


[01-Jan-21 11:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 11:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
Would be better


[01-Jan-21 11:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
and you want me to track attendance of LRs before kicked right


[01-Jan-21 11:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea please


[01-Jan-21 11:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Could be like a button for the host to click to record it


[01-Jan-21 11:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can make it a command if you'd like


[01-Jan-21 11:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
although not as secretive, up to you


[01-Jan-21 11:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Would it be possible for it to work with /e


[01-Jan-21 11:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
let me check


[01-Jan-21 11:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
So it hides it


[01-Jan-21 11:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Still exists in chat logs tho


[01-Jan-21 11:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
But when I'm on divine sister the admin allows me to say /e :cmd and it works without showing it


[01-Jan-21 11:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
without showing it in chat logs or chat


[01-Jan-21 11:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
or both


[01-Jan-21 11:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
It doesn't show it in chat but can be viewed in chat logs


[01-Jan-21 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok i can do that


[01-Jan-21 11:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok great ty sir


[01-Jan-21 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
/e lrattendance
and 
/e attendance
?


[01-Jan-21 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
first being used for before excess


[01-Jan-21 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
and by use for Seniors or HR+?


[01-Jan-21 11:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah that would be good


[01-Jan-21 11:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Seniors


[01-Jan-21 11:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 11:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since hrs aren't there just before excess isn't kicked


[01-Jan-21 11:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Is*


[01-Jan-21 11:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
merge TC and IC logs into 1 channel or split


[01-Jan-21 11:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
Merge, makes it easier


[01-Jan-21 11:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 11:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
For IC it will be only Mrs ofc


[01-Jan-21 11:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 11:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
where should the command be displayed as a reminder


[01-Jan-21 11:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hm it could appear on the host screen once u do the host command to remind them.


[01-Jan-21 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[01-Jan-21 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
forgot that existed


[01-Jan-21 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
good idea


[01-Jan-21 11:24 PM] bonnie591#0591

[01-Jan-21 11:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Is the attendance command for Mrs or both lrs and Mrs


[01-Jan-21 11:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm guessing the lr attendance is obviously for lrs


[01-Jan-21 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
do you want to log LRs who stay or no


[01-Jan-21 11:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hm if possible sure


[01-Jan-21 11:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Also I had a concern from a staff earlier today. They applied at the app center but while it was waiting to be read they did interviews and trainings. Once it was read and the bot ranked them they were ranked from bar back to trainee. Is it possible to have a conformation message for when we rank someone from lr to trainee so we don't have this problem regularly @Beartikal


[01-Jan-21 11:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
We do sometimes demote to rank 3 for behaviour they requires them to need retraining.


[01-Jan-21 11:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
So we can't have it error all together so a confirmation would be good


[01-Jan-21 11:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
alright ill see what i can come up with


[01-Jan-21 11:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thx sir! This new system is a massive help


[01-Jan-21 11:42 PM] bonnie591#0591

[02-Jan-21 12:57 AM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 12:57 AM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 01:48 AM] KjRBLX#2053
You seen what i just posted in hr announcements?


[02-Jan-21 02:32 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Anyone know how many phones galaxy has had?


[02-Jan-21 02:33 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Or has an android?


[02-Jan-21 04:01 AM] KjRBLX#2053

but is he rlly still around with bloxton?


[02-Jan-21 04:07 AM] Beartikal#9760
former user was asen remember @KjRBLX


[02-Jan-21 04:08 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm not sure, maybe not. I think Galaxy just thought that this construct/grayson/joker pfp was Serenso


[02-Jan-21 04:08 AM] Beartikal#9760
the guy responded as if he was involved


[02-Jan-21 04:09 AM] Beartikal#9760
he asked how he knew of the serenso situation


[02-Jan-21 04:09 AM] KjRBLX#2053
🤷‍♂️ We'll just have to see once the rest of the HR team wakes up and reviews the stuff i sent.


[02-Jan-21 04:10 AM] Beartikal#9760

and the asen/serenso smiley face??


[02-Jan-21 04:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
idk just some random stuff i found could just be a coincidence


[02-Jan-21 04:25 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Really, someone should probably bring in Galaxy for some questioning because he did mention a target group. This could all be a wild goose chase though. better to be safe than sorry


[02-Jan-21 04:35 AM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 05:04 AM] stacey#1000
Sounds like something Kayla would do


[02-Jan-21 05:04 AM] stacey#1000
She is not an hr that got fired but she is a former toxic hr


[02-Jan-21 05:07 AM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX this is something that happened to me when I got manager but the thing is the evidence in this one and real evidence of photos leaked from SL in it so still not sure how they got that. The only way I can think is to ask gotme to actually record discord. Her closing it and reopening it, then going to the evidence and showing it all again, while also proving it was galaxy. I was surprised when she randomly reported him out of nowhere cause I’ve never trusted her. Gotme is so toxic. When we fire people we are suppose to actually investigate and question people first so idk why galaxy was fired so quick without anyone questioning him about leaking and suspending him. If I was on when he was about to get fired I would’ve said that.


[02-Jan-21 05:08 AM] stacey#1000
Well we don’t question all of them if the evidence seems legit but if it’s from like questionable people like gotme I think we should


[02-Jan-21 05:12 AM] stacey#1000
We knew for awhile there was a head that was in the bst timezone that leaked. So...galaxy if he was bst or that timezone that also fits that.  All I have to say regarding this for now


[02-Jan-21 05:21 AM] Beartikal#9760
is there any cb named emma


[02-Jan-21 05:22 AM] stacey#1000
One more thing to say, in the first evidence shown that Emily sent it looks like a discord server with other people that you cannot see which seemed sus to me cause I was gonna ask Emily to see who they were https://gyazo.com/3ceb8f7183e55cc0410947ba856734db

Yes there was a cb named Emma


[02-Jan-21 05:22 AM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 05:22 AM] stacey#1000
We got rid of cb rule


[02-Jan-21 05:22 AM] Beartikal#9760
ik


[02-Jan-21 05:22 AM] stacey#1000
But she was a cb yes


[02-Jan-21 05:22 AM] stacey#1000
One of the really annoying ones


[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
also whos emily


[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] stacey#1000
She “resigned” from being a cb and just came back again


[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] stacey#1000
The rank 14 Emily lol


[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] stacey#1000
@emily


[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
OH


[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 05:23 AM] stacey#1000
LOL


[02-Jan-21 05:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
yeah true what discord is that


[02-Jan-21 05:25 AM] stacey#1000
I was gonna ask this but galaxy was already fired but I was immediately sus of it from the fact it looked like a discord server with other people


[02-Jan-21 05:25 AM] stacey#1000
Sus as in, why didn’t other people report it, why wait over a month? All sus situation


[02-Jan-21 05:25 AM] stacey#1000
Then gotme reporting it out of nowhere when she is legit so toxic and can never be trusted y’all trusted her right away to fire galaxy quick


[02-Jan-21 05:26 AM] stacey#1000
Rip galaxy

[02-Jan-21 05:56 AM] Beartikal#9760
from like 2014 lol


[02-Jan-21 08:22 AM] cory!#8287
Doesn’t make sense on how that could possibly be malicious though. They sent video evidence of him leaking so idk how they could have messed with it


[02-Jan-21 08:22 AM] cory!#8287
But we could look into it


[02-Jan-21 08:33 AM] cory!#8287
Is it ok if I send the evidence to him?


[02-Jan-21 08:33 AM] cory!#8287
ik she wanted to remain anonymous but idk


[02-Jan-21 09:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Galaxy sent me a YouTube video of the full conversation with that construct/ grayson/joker pfp. Let me get that


[02-Jan-21 09:37 AM] Tattoblue#5828
I kinda want him to see the evidence so he can try and explain it but idk


[02-Jan-21 09:37 AM] Tattoblue#5828
You remember how we fired gotme’s alt


[02-Jan-21 09:38 AM] cory!#8287
yeah he sent me that too kj


[02-Jan-21 09:38 AM] cory!#8287
i read the whole convo and it seems sus


[02-Jan-21 09:38 AM] KjRBLX#2053
The limiteds, right?


[02-Jan-21 09:38 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Ya


[02-Jan-21 09:38 AM] cory!#8287
ya and telling him where he lives and stuff


[02-Jan-21 09:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[02-Jan-21 09:40 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Also the grayson guy was the one that reported gotme so I wonder if they’re friends now or smithing


[02-Jan-21 09:40 AM] cory!#8287
gotme always uses a similar profile structure which is why i always know its her ALT lmao

The grayson guy was the one that reported gotme?


[02-Jan-21 09:43 AM] cory!#8287
do we wanna question him


[02-Jan-21 09:44 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@KjRBLX yeah


[02-Jan-21 09:45 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@cory! I think as long as you don’t send proof from like their dms then it’s fine, like the gif of him leaking In that server

[02-Jan-21 09:46 AM] cory!#8287
okay ill send him that one and ask him some questions


[02-Jan-21 09:46 AM] cory!#8287
do u wanna be apart of it tatto


[02-Jan-21 09:46 AM] cory!#8287
i can invite him into a GC


[02-Jan-21 09:46 AM] cory!#8287
and we can questin him


[02-Jan-21 09:46 AM] KjRBLX#2053

[02-Jan-21 09:46 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Send him what one?


[02-Jan-21 09:47 AM] cory!#8287
the one tatto sent


[02-Jan-21 09:47 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I think he meant dont send that one because it has the reporter in it, the reporter wanted to stay anonymous i believe


[02-Jan-21 09:48 AM] cory!#8287
oh


[02-Jan-21 09:48 AM] cory!#8287

is it like inspect element or something


[02-Jan-21 10:15 AM] Tattoblue#5828
well he never said that it was fake but he thinks it might be fake because people were basically attacking him


[02-Jan-21 10:15 AM] Tattoblue#5828
like a group of people


[02-Jan-21 10:16 AM] bonnie591#0591

@Tattoblue


[02-Jan-21 10:29 AM] cory!#8287
they wanna know who sent them so they can look attheir dm history


[02-Jan-21 10:30 AM] cory!#8287
but i dont think it was sent in dms


[02-Jan-21 11:11 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Tell him it was from a server and that the reporter is anonymous


[02-Jan-21 11:13 AM] cory!#8287
alright


[02-Jan-21 11:52 AM] cory!#8287
should I ask him some questions? like if he knows CBs or if he was in group chats with blacklisted users etc cause he’s saying that he doesn’t know how he can prove it’s fake if he doesn’t know who reported it


[02-Jan-21 11:56 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Either galaxy left that server


[02-Jan-21 11:56 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Or one of these may be it

[02-Jan-21 11:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
In the video, it showed the mutual servers


[02-Jan-21 11:58 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Or they did something to make it look like he was in it


[02-Jan-21 12:01 PM] cory!#8287
who reported galaxy?


[02-Jan-21 12:01 PM] cory!#8287
it was gotme correct?


[02-Jan-21 12:01 PM] emily#4444
yeah


[02-Jan-21 12:02 PM] cory!#8287
she’s not even in the Noah’s treehouse discord server


[02-Jan-21 12:02 PM] cory!#8287
unless she’s not verified


[02-Jan-21 12:02 PM] emily#4444
isnt it the other server


[02-Jan-21 12:02 PM] emily#4444
in the gyazo it shows his galacksee user and not galaxypixelz


[02-Jan-21 12:04 PM] cory!#8287
yes ik I was talking the mutual servers cause she has to be in that server to see if galaxy’s in it


[02-Jan-21 12:04 PM] cory!#8287
I think right?


[02-Jan-21 12:05 PM] emily#4444
oooh yeah true


[02-Jan-21 12:07 PM] cory!#8287
ok I checked and galaxy’s in that server too


[02-Jan-21 12:08 PM] cory!#8287
so maybe she joined and left idk


[02-Jan-21 12:32 PM] cory!#8287
I was looking closely at the evidence and she shows mutual friends should I ask him to take a picture of his friends list on discord


[02-Jan-21 12:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i wanna host a server just to test out the passing system


[02-Jan-21 12:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but im tired..then my moms is taking all of us with her so she can go get some shoes


[02-Jan-21 01:11 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[02-Jan-21 03:24 PM] cory!#8287
I GOT HIM TO CONFESS


[02-Jan-21 03:25 PM] cory!#8287
so he did leak he was just playing innocent


[02-Jan-21 03:28 PM] cory!#8287
he made all that up


[02-Jan-21 03:30 PM] cory!#8287
what i think happened was he was leaking to gotme and other CBs for a while, then he reported chellcoo and memelord which got them mad so they retaliated against galaxy and reported him as well


[02-Jan-21 03:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So self destruction?


[02-Jan-21 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
I mean it’s good the leaker we knew was there for awhile is finally gone


[02-Jan-21 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
But I still dont trust gotme at all


[02-Jan-21 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! id add a vote to remove their former roles. Other MRs that have chosen to troll questions and be really dumb have had it removed


[02-Jan-21 03:56 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[02-Jan-21 05:02 PM] Polk#1596
is there a way for us to see the account ages on the board or automatically not rank them if they have an account age below 30 @Beartikal


[02-Jan-21 05:34 PM] katie#0200
@Polk apparently lee abused btools again, did u see? he's done something similar before too https://discord.com/channels/325865347045523456/698763137607925855/782365404596928542

[02-Jan-21 06:28 PM] Polk#1596
yes, i know. holly is being a bit dramatic as it was at the very end of the session when the whole gokart map was in ruins


[02-Jan-21 06:29 PM] Polk#1596
she really doesnt get along with lee and she kept messing around when lee tried to be serious earlier


[02-Jan-21 06:29 PM] Polk#1596
the same thing literally happened a few weeks ago, i just think she is a bit salty but i would in no way punish lee for that


[02-Jan-21 06:29 PM] Polk#1596
@katie


[02-Jan-21 06:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So we're suppose to...should fit our training guide to fit new commands


[02-Jan-21 06:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So we take attendance or?


[02-Jan-21 06:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
or seniors still just take attendance


[02-Jan-21 06:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Mmmmm


[02-Jan-21 07:01 PM] anna#0004
@stacey ill update the guides tomorrow


[02-Jan-21 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
alrighty


[02-Jan-21 07:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
are there excess in Interviews or do MRs only ask interview Q's?


[02-Jan-21 07:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
im adding the /e attendance command there


[02-Jan-21 07:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok ill do 1 attendance command there


[02-Jan-21 07:47 PM] ethan;#0003
what about a command that automatically gives mrs mod


[02-Jan-21 07:47 PM] ethan;#0003
so we dont need to type in every name


[02-Jan-21 07:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh


[02-Jan-21 07:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah i can do dat


[02-Jan-21 07:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
interview/TC or both


[02-Jan-21 07:53 PM] ethan;#0003
both


[02-Jan-21 07:53 PM] ethan;#0003
and ace told me that the ranking thing doesnt work if they leave the game


[02-Jan-21 07:53 PM] ethan;#0003
if the person who needs to be ranked leaves it doesnt rank them


[02-Jan-21 07:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[02-Jan-21 07:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
they must be in game to rank i havent set up a proxy to do it without


[02-Jan-21 07:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
its best to rank as soon as passed


[02-Jan-21 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
no excess in ints


[02-Jan-21 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jan-21 07:55 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jan-21 07:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
#attendance-logs


[02-Jan-21 07:55 PM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 07:55 PM] ethan;#0003
only at trainings we do that?


[02-Jan-21 07:56 PM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 07:56 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jan-21 07:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
/e LRattendance


[02-Jan-21 07:56 PM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 07:56 PM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 07:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah change to 9


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
heads is 8


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
or is rank ID's not match up


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
not match up


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
9 is real


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
also at ints this hasnt ever been fixed !slock 9 is really slock !slock 8


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
and trainings


[02-Jan-21 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
!slock 8 lets in rank 7s


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] ethan;#0003
when it shouldnt


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
o yea i didnt do a shift


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
havent auto shifted those


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] ethan;#0003
its been like that for 2  years


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] ethan;#0003
LOL


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
ik


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[02-Jan-21 07:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
is it possible for u to shift honor member to 1 so we can make the rank id numbers the same


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
id need to update bloxlink keybinds and stuff but it would give head of sec and services their separate role


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
does /e attendance work at interviews?


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
the problem with that is that honor members would overlap with hotel guest, meaning i wouldn't be able to offer special perks if i want to


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
for being that rank


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
and yes @ethan;


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm how about moving head of services+ up by 1


[02-Jan-21 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
i did it what happened


[02-Jan-21 08:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
so head of services and security havent got same thing


[02-Jan-21 08:00 PM] ethan;#0003
it didnt show in #attendance-logs


[02-Jan-21 08:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
i updated it just now


[02-Jan-21 08:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
so new server


[02-Jan-21 08:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
have you added rank button to ints


[02-Jan-21 08:01 PM] ethan;#0003
so seniors dont make cards on the senior board anymore?


[02-Jan-21 08:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
once rank button is added to interviews yes


[02-Jan-21 08:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
they dont for trainings anymore


[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
so makes life much more easier


[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
i did /e attendance


[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
and it isnt in #attendance-logs


[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
it needs to be a new server


[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591

[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jan-21 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591

[02-Jan-21 08:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Beartikal


[02-Jan-21 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760

[02-Jan-21 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jan-21 08:12 PM] Polk#1596

@stacey megan is inactive again, hasnt done anything since november, and only did the 75% checklist one time


[02-Jan-21 08:15 PM] ethan;#0003
2 times actually


[02-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
Seniors are excused from checklist rn


[02-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
so she has the right to be inactive rn


[02-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
remember


[02-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
christmas and new years happened so like


[02-Jan-21 08:16 PM] bonnie591#0591

[02-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
we cant hold it against her rn


[02-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
she is also not even home rn


[02-Jan-21 08:16 PM] Polk#1596
holly is supposedly upset about lee's actions at the tc when she wasnt being any better, then she decided to go ahead and dm two HRs about it instead of me which is very sus


[02-Jan-21 08:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
she did attend the meeting


[02-Jan-21 08:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
What did Lee do


[02-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
megan went to the meeting but on her tablet


[02-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
if shes still inactive like


[02-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
come february we can look at it again


[02-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
but as of rn seniors are excused from checklist until jan 11th


[02-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
so cant hold it against her or any other senior rn for being inactive

[02-Jan-21 08:29 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah and if they are already a staff it should archive too


[02-Jan-21 08:30 PM] stacey#1000

Otherwise heads basically taking the job of managers


[02-Jan-21 08:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Heads have mod at training center @Beartikal


[02-Jan-21 08:40 PM] lyss#0709
im assuming having heads get mod as soon as they join trainings is a mistake then

It's suppose to be manager+


[02-Jan-21 08:45 PM] stacey#1000
Heads+ suppose to get mod at only interview


[02-Jan-21 08:45 PM] stacey#1000
Trainings is manager+ not heads


[02-Jan-21 08:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey


[02-Jan-21 08:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Managers know they're getting mod right or no?


[02-Jan-21 08:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like for now on at training centers


[02-Jan-21 08:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and interview


[02-Jan-21 08:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i forgot i cant remember if we told them or not


[02-Jan-21 08:59 PM] lyss#0709
wait so since we no longer have to mod servers, can seniors just start at the start time instead of us joining their servers


[02-Jan-21 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
I think it isnt bad


[02-Jan-21 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
cus they can now check passers answers


[02-Jan-21 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
instead of the manager


[02-Jan-21 09:12 PM] courtney#5125
no i really think thats a bad idea for them to have mod


[02-Jan-21 09:12 PM] courtney#5125
theres no reason for them to have it, managers are perfectly fine with checking. a troller is now just one step closer to being able to easily abuse as a head


[02-Jan-21 09:12 PM] stacey#1000
Heads would be taking the job away from managers tho if they checked answers


[02-Jan-21 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
but managers do it just fine, and theyre skilled in doing it


[02-Jan-21 09:14 PM] courtney#5125
if a head proves theyre ready to handle the responsibility, then they can handle it as a manager. its a manager's responsibility. they were heads, they experienced different situations, they have worked to be ready to deal with the responsibility of having moderator at training


[02-Jan-21 09:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
plus i dont feel comfortable with heads having mod


[02-Jan-21 09:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we're bound to have issues later down the road i bet you 5000 robux


[02-Jan-21 09:22 PM] courtney#5125
^^^^


[02-Jan-21 09:23 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i agree


[02-Jan-21 09:23 PM] lyss#0709
so, do we just have the seniors start their servers at the start time without leaving our own server now?


[02-Jan-21 10:04 PM] cory!#8287
if ayngels decides to try and appeal for her former role keep these in mind

[03-Jan-21 03:37 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah he can if he wants and yeah I don’t recall that we blacklisted him @KjRBLX


[03-Jan-21 07:11 AM] Polk#1596
yeah ^


[03-Jan-21 11:22 AM] katie#0200
I’ll dm u our dms


[03-Jan-21 11:28 AM] Polk#1596
yes


[03-Jan-21 11:47 AM] cory!#8287
does the attendance command work at interviews now


[03-Jan-21 11:47 AM] cory!#8287
and rank command


[03-Jan-21 11:52 AM] cory!#8287

[03-Jan-21 01:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank just curious, does anyone ever get 8 servers? @Polk probs does but idk just asking


[03-Jan-21 01:10 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[03-Jan-21 01:10 PM] ethan;#0003
i havent gotten more then 5 iin a long time


[03-Jan-21 01:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
i just got 8


[03-Jan-21 01:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
nearly 9


[03-Jan-21 01:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Maybe only once but atmost ik is like 5


[03-Jan-21 01:10 PM] katie#0200
nope


[03-Jan-21 01:12 PM] cory!#8287
I’ve only gotten 7 I think


[03-Jan-21 01:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
yas cory


[03-Jan-21 01:27 PM] katie#0200
I think the most I got was 9 but that was ages ago


[03-Jan-21 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve gotten 9 before


[03-Jan-21 02:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg it's soooo nice


[03-Jan-21 02:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
not having to worry about like seniors and them having their admin


[03-Jan-21 02:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and the heads etc


[03-Jan-21 02:36 PM] anna#0004
its so much easier nowww


[03-Jan-21 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
So heads don’t have mod at trainings rn do they?


[03-Jan-21 02:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i believe bear fixed it


[03-Jan-21 04:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I thought maybe sizzleburger turned their server to like a 7-eleven gas station server

[03-Jan-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 usually when people get fired they have to wait at least a month before they can get former


[03-Jan-21 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
a lot of formers that got fired and apologized had to wait


[03-Jan-21 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
idc how many times he apologizes, he was literally leaking for months and is only saying sorry because he got caught now. I bet if gotme hadn't reported him he would still be doing it.


[03-Jan-21 04:40 PM] stacey#1000
he is the head we were looking for since legit like the end of May


[03-Jan-21 04:40 PM] stacey#1000
he knew it was wrong and leaked for months, I do not think he is a good representation of a former. He should wait 30 days like everyone else does


[03-Jan-21 04:40 PM] courtney#5125
he shouldnt get it until at least a month after his termination


[03-Jan-21 04:41 PM] stacey#1000
if it were up to me I wouldve blacklisted him too


[03-Jan-21 04:41 PM] courtney#5125
he can feel as sorry as he likes, he admitted to leaking and theres solid proof against him. theres no difference between him and any other mr thats ever been terminated for leaking before


[03-Jan-21 04:41 PM] stacey#1000
hes legit only being nice to HRs cause he got caught but leaking for so many months he knew it was wrong


[03-Jan-21 04:41 PM] courtney#5125
^^


[03-Jan-21 04:42 PM] courtney#5125
not to mention he went around to a lot of us and tried to claim it was false even though it wasnt


[03-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
he should be lucky hes not blacklisted at this point


[03-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
cause I wouldve blacklisted him for the lying alone


[03-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
I think moody can appeal for former MR now though


[03-Jan-21 04:45 PM] lyss#0709
i agree -- galaxy can apologize all he wants, but it doesnt change the fact that he's leaked an insane amount of things for quite a while. he's only sorry about it because he got caught and doesnt want people to think differently of him


[03-Jan-21 04:45 PM] lyss#0709
and i agree with stacey that moody should be able to appeal for his former role now


[03-Jan-21 04:48 PM] anna#0004
yeah moody should appeal but not galaxy yet

[03-Jan-21 05:11 PM] stacey#1000
does the ranking bot rank low acc people or do we have to check then kick them


[03-Jan-21 05:11 PM] stacey#1000
cause im still not letting low acc age people get a rank


[03-Jan-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal


[03-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
currently it does not have an age limit


[03-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can change that if u want


[03-Jan-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
yes that would be great like if people with an acc age of like 15 or lower shouldnt get ranked


[03-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
(for the in-game one at least)


[03-Jan-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
majority of them get a rank to abuse


[03-Jan-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
yeah the in game ranking


[03-Jan-21 05:32 PM] babymariobebe#7563

@xM_inn Sorry, I didnt mention something about that photo


[03-Jan-21 09:53 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Those messages sent in Staff Lounge by stacey were linked to an announcement


[03-Jan-21 09:54 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn huh


[03-Jan-21 09:54 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Pretty sure it what really striked it was because a inappropriate topic in SL occured


[03-Jan-21 09:54 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I believe whale sperm or so


[03-Jan-21 09:55 PM] stacey#1000
I posted that awhile ago


[03-Jan-21 09:55 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t remember who was all involved


[03-Jan-21 09:55 PM] stacey#1000
Hadley


[03-Jan-21 09:55 PM] stacey#1000
Former MR now


[03-Jan-21 09:55 PM] stacey#1000
And someone else


[03-Jan-21 09:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I believe Benson just referenced that announcement because it related to how they treated Mirk in VC.


[03-Jan-21 09:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But the individuals involved with this is L_3ee, Connor, and Jxck


[03-Jan-21 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
All of them should be given a warning or suspension for those involved


[03-Jan-21 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
And I guess I have to make a new announcement  again


[03-Jan-21 09:58 PM] lyss#0709
connor's done this in the past too


[03-Jan-21 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
Mirk is dming me now


[03-Jan-21 09:58 PM] lyss#0709
and just a few days ago in vc connor blew up at kyle for hardly any reason at all


[03-Jan-21 09:59 PM] stacey#1000
Connor is close to a termination


[03-Jan-21 09:59 PM] stacey#1000
He’s been suspended before


[03-Jan-21 10:00 PM] courtney#5125
connor's never been able to stay out of trouble


[03-Jan-21 10:00 PM] stacey#1000
Idek how he got management


[03-Jan-21 10:03 PM] lyss#0709
yeah he gets really disrespectful for no reason, kyle was rlly unnerved by the situation the other day, as well as when connor did the same thing to him a few months ago in which case he was suspended. and now this like wow


[03-Jan-21 10:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I wouldn’t even say he’s close, at this point Connor is at his termination door. Connor has been suspended time after time after time for the **same** reasons. Honestly at this point suspensions aren’t working for him


[03-Jan-21 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I'd say terminate him he is just way too disrespectful and is not a good role model for other MRs.


[03-Jan-21 10:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
In the vc, it just escalated from 0 to 100. Im not sure who started the attacking but 1 said something and the other two just joined in


[03-Jan-21 10:35 PM] stacey#1000
I say terminate connor, give a suspension or heavy warning to the others involved, and make an announcement to all MRs regarding respect.


[03-Jan-21 10:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Because i said something n the vc like, “umm what is theproblem, like everyone cranky today?”


[03-Jan-21 10:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I should of said something before they all joined in but i was kinda phased out


[03-Jan-21 10:38 PM] stacey#1000
Do you know who started it?


[03-Jan-21 10:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I cant remember


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
Mk well I say add a vote to terminate connor at this point.


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I could ask benson though maybe be remembers


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
Who was all involved again?


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Jxck, Lee, Connor


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
Mk so Jxck and Lee don't have anything on their records that I am aware of


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
So I would say either suspend or warn them


[03-Jan-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
add a vote


[03-Jan-21 10:49 PM] Fraux#7971
honestly


[03-Jan-21 10:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
whoever’s gonna term Connor has a bod permission


[03-Jan-21 10:49 PM] Fraux#7971
why is it so hard for Connor to just


[03-Jan-21 10:49 PM] Fraux#7971
like


[03-Jan-21 10:49 PM] Fraux#7971
BEHAVE


[03-Jan-21 10:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk


[03-Jan-21 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez do I have bod permission to make an announcement to all MRs regarding inclusion and respecting each other


[03-Jan-21 10:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Jan-21 11:13 PM] lyss#0709
alrighty, ill send the letter here when i type it. what is the exact reasoning for the termination?


[03-Jan-21 11:14 PM] stacey#1000
being disrespectful towards another MR and encouraging other MRs to participate


[03-Jan-21 11:14 PM] stacey#1000
just really rude towards people


[03-Jan-21 11:14 PM] lyss#0709
okay, ty!


[03-Jan-21 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
ok how this for an announcment


[03-Jan-21 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
**Respect and Inclusion in Staff Lounge & Voice Channels**

Greetings MRs,

I am disappointed I have to make an announcement regarding this  yet **again**.  This is what the 3rd time I am having to announce something regarding this? 

I suggest you read this **very** carefully, because trust me I will **not** be making more announcements regarding this again in the future. 


In two previous announcements I said:

-**Staff lounge is not a place for you to disrespect, trash talk and make fun of other staff members. If we see this happening after this announcement is made, expect to receive a warning, suspension, or termination. Even if the person is disrespectful to you, it doesn’t give you the right to treat them the same way back.**

-**Remember to treat everyone with respect and kindness. To do that you should listen to each other and ensure everyone is treated fairly.**


[03-Jan-21 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t understand what is so hard about respecting each other? If you don’t have anything nice to say, you shouldn’t be saying it at all. This goes for MR voice chats as well. You should **NEVER** be making another MR feel uncomfortable and disrespected. If you have an issue with someone, contact an HR regarding it, don’t be disrespectful to them.  That is just a real immature way to handle it if you choose to make them feel less of themselves.

I would also like to add, swearing may be permitted in the MR channels, but if you read the rules it says **keep it to a respectful limit**. If you choose to swear to the point it is being extremely disrespectful towards an individual, it will **NOT** be tolerated. 

Let me remind you staff lounge is a privilege that has been taken away, and can easily be taken away again. I am not trying to sound harsh here, but if you guys cannot follow a simple announcement to respect each other and treat each other with respect, I will not hesitate to close staff lounge. So, let this be your **last** reminder on how you treat those around you in MR channels and MR voice chats. Respect each other, don’t make anyone feel less of themselves, and be the good role models I know you all are. 

Sincerely,
staceyvx

Greetings connorg2404,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as Management from Bloxton Hotels as of January 3rd, 2021, 11:xx PM CST. The reasoning behind your termination is due to being rude and generally disrespecting another MR, as well as encouraging other MRs to participate. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

I mean connor did most of it thats why hes fired


[04-Jan-21 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
lee and jack was more minor and dont have a past record of it thats why they only get warnings


[04-Jan-21 12:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah and they should be grateful but ig not


[04-Jan-21 12:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I literally heard them swearing a mirk and benson did too


[04-Jan-21 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
just tell them its not anything major, warnings are just for reminders to keep it in mind for next time


[04-Jan-21 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
they should be lucky its not a suspension


[04-Jan-21 12:27 AM] stacey#1000
but if they cannot accept a warning either that says something


[04-Jan-21 12:43 AM] KjRBLX#2053

Pretty sure bear stated lower than 30, not 15 @stacey


[04-Jan-21 08:14 AM] lyss#0709
yeah he does, i kept explaining it to him and he eventually stopped responding to me but the point seemed to get across to him


[04-Jan-21 10:27 AM] ethan;#0003
did connor really say


[04-Jan-21 10:27 AM] ethan;#0003
"im not rude"


[04-Jan-21 10:28 AM] ethan;#0003
biggest lie i ever heard


[04-Jan-21 10:28 AM] ethan;#0003
he is very toxic


[04-Jan-21 10:28 AM] ethan;#0003
idk if he notices


[04-Jan-21 10:28 AM] ethan;#0003
cus some people dont notice when they are rude


[04-Jan-21 10:30 AM] lyss#0709
yes he kept saying things like that when i was explaining the situation to him


[04-Jan-21 10:31 AM] lyss#0709
and then eventually it just led to him making self-deprecating comments


[04-Jan-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
he does that all the time


[04-Jan-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
he did that when he got suspended


[04-Jan-21 11:08 AM] stacey#1000
Does lee and jack not understand a warning is minor? @bonnie591


[04-Jan-21 11:08 AM] stacey#1000
I’ve never seen people make a whole statement over something minor like that.


[04-Jan-21 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
Like they are not suspended or anything and it’s literally just like a general reminder for them. Connor got fired for his actions and they just got warned for being a little bit involved. If they can’t  handle a warning like this that is concerning for how they would actually handle a suspension.


[04-Jan-21 11:10 AM] KjRBLX#2053
😐


[04-Jan-21 11:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
They are trying to appeal their warning pretty much to get it off their record probabaly


[04-Jan-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
Well I don’t think it should be removed given they were involved a bit and still took part in what happened. Warnings are not that big on their record, people can still get promoted with warnings.

All over a warning that i mentioned was minor


[04-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
He was asked many times to stop


[04-Jan-21 11:14 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Why is flyro even involved he’s not even in the discord


[04-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
Wait a minute


[04-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
Lee and Jack are telling everyone they were warned?


[04-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
They told Flyro?


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
Hm....that’s telling me if they are complaining to literally everyone over a warning they might just be earning themselves a suspension


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It looks to be of flyro is asking for all sides?


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if*


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] lyss#0709
a warning was probably one of the most minor things that could've been given to them. especially considering disrespect is a huge deal. i understand if they want to get the whole story across, that's fine, but the fact that theyre trying to completely understate their actions and make it seem like constantly telling someone to shut the fuck up **isnt** "that bad", thats not really okay. jack and lee should really just be thankful that a formal warning was ALL they got


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
I’m just saying if lee and jack are like going around complaining to everyone over something minor


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
Like flyro for example


[04-Jan-21 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
That doesn’t look good for them


[04-Jan-21 11:16 AM] stacey#1000
Idk if they actually did tho


[04-Jan-21 11:16 AM] stacey#1000
Tbh lee and jack are getting closer to an actual suspension at this point


[04-Jan-21 11:17 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Everyone makes mistakes hence their formal warning which is like you said Stacey reminding them to chill out.

Connor got terminated because idk how many times he’s been suspended


[04-Jan-21 11:18 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I know I suspended him, Katie did as well for the same reason

He cusses in vc like everytime hes in vc


[04-Jan-21 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
I’m just not liking how lee and jack are handling this at all and im thinking we should’ve suspended them instead


[04-Jan-21 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
If they cannot learn over a minor warning maybe a suspension will help them learn


[04-Jan-21 11:18 AM] lyss#0709
im so confused as to why flyro is choosing to include himself and act like hes the dictator of this when hes not even remotely involved


[04-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
If I was added to that group chat with flyro


[04-Jan-21 11:19 AM] lyss#0709
its truly none of his concern


[04-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
I would’ve straight up shut him down and told him it was not of his concern and he has no place to be doing that


[04-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
There is a reason he’s blacklisted


[04-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
He shouldn’t be involved in investigations like that


[04-Jan-21 11:19 AM] lyss#0709

I would’ve left the group chat


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
And if lee and jack were in the group chat


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
And explained their side


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
They were leaking at that point if flyro was there


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
Explaining what happened in a MR+ voice chat???


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
To a blacklisted person?


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
Connor gets blacklisted


[04-Jan-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
I’m blacklisting him


[04-Jan-21 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
Mhm no ty


[04-Jan-21 11:21 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I left the gc


[04-Jan-21 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
Did lee and jack say anything to flyro


[04-Jan-21 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
Or no


[04-Jan-21 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
Cause if they did they are up for leaking


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
If they explained what happened in an MR+ vc to a blacklisted user


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
They are done for


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Lee said he told flyro nun

Jxck wasnt in the gc


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
Good


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] lyss#0709
yeah i dont understand why flyro, someone who isnt even part of the community anymore and has no business in the investigation whatsoever, is trying to get an hr's and former mr's perspective on a situation that has nothing to do with him or anyone else


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
Connor leaked so goodbye time to blacklist Connor


[04-Jan-21 11:22 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Only people who typed was flyro


[04-Jan-21 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Lee and Jack just need to accept the minor warning and accept responsibility for their actions


[04-Jan-21 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Because if they continue showing they cannot accept it they are just closer to a suspension


[04-Jan-21 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
All I have to say regarding that


[04-Jan-21 11:25 AM] lyss#0709
yeah agreed


[04-Jan-21 11:25 AM] KjRBLX#2053

He’s had way too many chances. There’s nothing to explain


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] Fraux#7971
that is the most extra document i have ever read i-


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] lyss#0709
connor already explained his "side" to me, and it basically consisted of him tossing the blame over to jack and lee, without taking any responsibility at all and just constantly repeating that he doesnt want people to see him like "that"


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
Can someone blacklist Connor


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
I’m not on pc


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
He legit leaked to flyro about what happened in the vc


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
And complained in general discussion causing drama


[04-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
So he’s made it worse for himself


[04-Jan-21 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
Wait I’ll add a vote to blacklist


[04-Jan-21 11:28 AM] ethan;#0003
there is NO side...


[04-Jan-21 11:28 AM] ethan;#0003
he was toxic


[04-Jan-21 11:28 AM] ethan;#0003
he doesnt understand he was toxic


[04-Jan-21 11:28 AM] ethan;#0003
thats it


[04-Jan-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Ok so if someone wants to blacklist him rn go ahead


[04-Jan-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
If not I will later


[04-Jan-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
When I’m on oc


[04-Jan-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Pc


[04-Jan-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
He’s getting banned from discord too


[04-Jan-21 11:30 AM] cory!#8287
lmao why did he leak to flyro


[04-Jan-21 11:30 AM] cory!#8287
I can do it after my class


[04-Jan-21 11:31 AM] stacey#1000
Who’s connorg2405


[04-Jan-21 11:31 AM] cory!#8287
idk


[04-Jan-21 11:31 AM] stacey#1000
I banned Connor from discord and saw that user


[04-Jan-21 11:31 AM] stacey#1000
Another former MR


[04-Jan-21 11:31 AM] stacey#1000
connorg2405 weird


[04-Jan-21 11:32 AM] lyss#0709
connorg2405 is one of those formers who likes to involve themselves and make fun of ppl by changing their server nickname


[04-Jan-21 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
Oh


[04-Jan-21 11:32 AM] cory!#8287
yeah they’re all toxic


[04-Jan-21 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
Ok Connor gone from discord and will be blacklisted later when I’m on pc unless someone wanted to now


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] lyss#0709
like how a bunch of toxic formers and guests in general changed their nicknames to -their name-Kitty_YT to mock an lr


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] cory!#8287
they don’t like builder or Connor from what I’ve seen


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
If people change their names like that


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
They are violating a rule


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
Their names have to be their roblox usernames


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] lyss#0709
yeah they dont really ever seem to


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] lyss#0709
care


[04-Jan-21 11:33 AM] lyss#0709
about that


[04-Jan-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
So if they do that, change their names back and warn them


[04-Jan-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
If they continue they get kicked


[04-Jan-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Their username has to be their name


[04-Jan-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
I almost banned the wrong Connor


[04-Jan-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Cause idk who tf the other one is


[04-Jan-21 11:35 AM] lyss#0709
the connorg2405 nicknamed person is aidan


[04-Jan-21 11:35 AM] lyss#0709
aidannnx


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Is that his roblox username


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Can you change his nickname back to his actual name


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] lyss#0709
suresure


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Why can formers even change their nicknames-


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Only HR+ should be able to change their nicknames I thought


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] cory!#8287
I think they actually changed their Roblox user to that


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I legit almost banned the wrong person


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] cory!#8287
but I’m not sure


[04-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Oh


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] lyss#0709
aidan's roblox username is still Aidannnx


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] cory!#8287
oh


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] lyss#0709
same for most of the ppl who do that


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] lyss#0709
idk how they do it but


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
Just change his name back on discord I guess


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
I’m announcing something to managers and seniors rn


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
About nicknames


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
If I did ban the wrong Connor it would’ve been aidans fault for not following the rules


[04-Jan-21 11:37 AM] cory!#8287
maybe the permissions are messed up or something


[04-Jan-21 11:38 AM] lyss#0709
mel and liz used to do it a lot


[04-Jan-21 11:38 AM] KjRBLX#2053
That document....a hr shouldnt have to tell u to stop...idk what they would say if a hr wasnt there..and just because my user was in vc doesnt mean i was there.


[04-Jan-21 11:43 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright i gtg my lunch is over


[04-Jan-21 11:44 AM] lyss#0709
yeah exactly, regardless if an hr is or isnt there, it shouldnt change how youre treating someone. they shouldnt need an hr to ask them to stop, and if they did need you to tell them to stop in order to realize what they were doing wrong, then theyre not suitable for being on the mr team right now


[04-Jan-21 11:56 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 do I have permission


[04-Jan-21 11:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
to


[04-Jan-21 11:56 AM] stacey#1000
To make announcement to entire discord about nicknames and using alt accs to verify as that’s not their main just to get a new username in the discord


[04-Jan-21 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
Apparently that’s how people are doing it


[04-Jan-21 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
I’ve been talking to managers and seniors


[04-Jan-21 11:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[04-Jan-21 11:57 AM] stacey#1000
Ok ty


[04-Jan-21 11:59 AM] stacey#1000
It’s mostly formers that think it’s ok to do this

[04-Jan-21 12:33 PM] lyss#0709
lee and jack already admitted that they did say things like "shut up" and "shut the fuck up" a couple of times, but lee, jack, mirk, and benson all claimed that connor was the one who initiated it and that he even went as far as to personally insult mirk and continue to swear at him, so i dont get why hes still trying to defend himself


[04-Jan-21 12:38 PM] cory!#8287
yeah and he decided to cause unwanted drama and leaked so


[04-Jan-21 12:39 PM] lyss#0709
rightttt and the fact that he was suspended for generally the exact same reason previously


[04-Jan-21 12:39 PM] lyss#0709
i dont get why this is such a huge surprise to him


[04-Jan-21 02:27 PM] Fraux#7971
@stacey yes. I’m tired of the formers acting up. I swear that’s all they do


[04-Jan-21 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
I need help moderating it


[04-Jan-21 02:28 PM] Fraux#7971
I’ll see what I can do I’m ab to leave my house and pick my sis up


[04-Jan-21 02:28 PM] cory!#8287
I told builder to kick daisie and told him to dm me if she starts talking trash about him


[04-Jan-21 02:28 PM] cory!#8287
we should just ban her again cause she hasn’t changed


[04-Jan-21 02:28 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Who’s daisie @cory!


[04-Jan-21 02:29 PM] cory!#8287

[04-Jan-21 02:30 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[04-Jan-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
ONE CHANCE


[04-Jan-21 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
Rule 1 was always enforced


[04-Jan-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
when i unbanned her


[04-Jan-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
not really


[04-Jan-21 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
People just thought they could get away with it


[04-Jan-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
we never really enforced it


[04-Jan-21 02:32 PM] stacey#1000
I mean it’s always been a rule I mean


[04-Jan-21 02:32 PM] stacey#1000
We never did anything before


[04-Jan-21 02:32 PM] ethan;#0003
we never needed to enforce it cus the names where put automatically when verified


[04-Jan-21 02:32 PM] stacey#1000
But now we have to


[04-Jan-21 02:32 PM] stacey#1000
Cause of the alt acc thing


[04-Jan-21 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Which one is daisy


[04-Jan-21 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
She rejoined server but I keep getting confused which one is her to ban her


[04-Jan-21 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
Oh nvm


[04-Jan-21 03:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So have Lee, Jack, Connor stop complaining?


[04-Jan-21 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
Connor getting blacklisted still and I haven’t heard from lee or jack


[04-Jan-21 03:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean I told them I would come back after school and hear them out but it seems this document is enough


[04-Jan-21 03:12 PM] cory!#8287
@stacey do you want me to blacklist them for you if you havent done it already


[04-Jan-21 03:12 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Jan-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
Your choice


[04-Jan-21 04:02 PM] lyss#0709
he didnt invite me to it, but he started dming me again today and then went on to say he was creating his own server with ppl from bloxton to watch movies and do gamenights


[04-Jan-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
I have an alt too but I forget the login for it


[04-Jan-21 04:03 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Jan-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
I removed roles on mobile


[04-Jan-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
Ban them for: causing unneeded drama after being asked to stop multiple times


[04-Jan-21 04:38 PM] Polk#1596
BRUH IM STUPID


[04-Jan-21 04:38 PM] Polk#1596
I FORGOT U BAN THROUGH CLICKING ON THEM


[04-Jan-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000

Ok Hadley is banned


[04-Jan-21 04:41 PM] stacey#1000
@emily what’s trey talking to you about


[04-Jan-21 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
Uhh wheres


[04-Jan-21 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
19di0


[04-Jan-21 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
Cant find her


[04-Jan-21 04:41 PM] emily#4444
about wyatt being banned


[04-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
Why is trey getting involved tho


[04-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
Is he trying to get Wyatt unbanned


[04-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
Here Polk I’ll send tag


[04-Jan-21 04:43 PM] emily#4444
yeep


[04-Jan-21 04:43 PM] stacey#1000
AMELIA#2100


[04-Jan-21 04:43 PM] Polk#1596
Thanks


[04-Jan-21 04:43 PM] Polk#1596
Alright


[04-Jan-21 04:43 PM] Polk#1596
Uh she isnt in the server


[04-Jan-21 04:43 PM] Polk#1596
she left


[04-Jan-21 04:44 PM] Polk#1596
Mustve known she was about to get banned


[04-Jan-21 04:44 PM] lyss#0709
i feel like trey has developed the mindset that hes untouchable just bc hes a former hr, as if its a title that makes him immune to the rules


[04-Jan-21 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
Probably cause I removed her former role and she acted all innocent saying it was removed for nothing


[04-Jan-21 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
But if it got her to leave that works too


[04-Jan-21 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
This ain’t innocent

[04-Jan-21 04:46 PM] Fraux#7971
@Polk yeah imo that’s never been fair


[04-Jan-21 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if people didn’t abuse rule 1 in the first place I would’ve never had to make an announcement on it


[04-Jan-21 04:46 PM] lyss#0709
then again, most formers think theyre untouchable. but trey seems to involve himself all the time when the situation has nothing even remotely to do with him


[04-Jan-21 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
Don’t make alt accs to try and get around it then go complaining when you cannot follow a simple rule


[04-Jan-21 04:47 PM] lyss#0709
yup yup


[04-Jan-21 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I’ll second guess trey for mr for now


[04-Jan-21 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
He does seem to get involved with stuff he doesn’t need to as if he was still an HR


[04-Jan-21 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
like trying to understand why Wyatt was banned and get them unbanned


[04-Jan-21 04:48 PM] lyss#0709
righttt yeah he used to be pretty humble but now he seems to like to be bold


[04-Jan-21 04:48 PM] Polk#1596
Obviously we never meant any harm nor did we have the mindset of being above the rules and acting all high and mighty, we just did it for fun


[04-Jan-21 04:49 PM] Polk#1596
Formers are taking advantage of the fun and ruining it


[04-Jan-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
People arguing over a ban got themselves banned too :))


[04-Jan-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Formers ruined it


[04-Jan-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Now we have to actually enforce rule 1 because of it


[04-Jan-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
Yes


[04-Jan-21 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t get what the big deal about having your roblox username as your username though in the first place....like it’s a simple rule and people make a huge deal over it


[04-Jan-21 04:51 PM] Polk#1596
Idk lol


[04-Jan-21 04:51 PM] Polk#1596
They just needed to find an enemy


[04-Jan-21 04:51 PM] Polk#1596
Which ended up being us


[04-Jan-21 04:51 PM] Polk#1596
And now they claim Bloxton Hotels as a whole is corrupt


[04-Jan-21 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003

Swear word and it seems intentional unless they really didnt mean it


[04-Jan-21 04:52 PM] ethan;#0003
i told her the ban reason and she didnt know she swore


[04-Jan-21 04:52 PM] ethan;#0003
so idk


[04-Jan-21 04:52 PM] lyss#0709
they flat out swore and made no move to delete it or apologize


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
She was also involved in causing drama too


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
So she would’ve been banned like Hadley and Amelia


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
For that alone


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] ethan;#0003
ok then


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] ethan;#0003
thx


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
I think it was mostly Hadley and Amelia thi


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
Tho*


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
For that


[04-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
I didn’t ban that former


[04-Jan-21 04:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright, someone brought up a good point. Have we ever established like rules where your able to get server muted?


[04-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
Not really


[04-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
We just servermute if they are annoying


[04-Jan-21 04:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Who what


[04-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
But if you want to make some guidelines for that, go ahead


[04-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
Would be useful


[04-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Polk#1596
Hi ze nurse


[04-Jan-21 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591

[04-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Polk#1596
Formers acting up


[04-Jan-21 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Why


[04-Jan-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000

Wyatt got banned them out comes 2-3 formers complaining about it and causing unneeded drama and being toxic so I banned Hadley, took away amelias former then she left and was getting banned anyways.


[04-Jan-21 05:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, we should probably read Ideas and Improvements on management board.

@emily how do you host at 2 and 3am I need tips


[04-Jan-21 05:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
We should probably address to the management that we don't read the hinting reports, we only read it if we're doing research on a user.


[04-Jan-21 05:28 PM] stacey#1000
You can announce something to them if you want


[04-Jan-21 05:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Because I think Benson still thinks we check it


[04-Jan-21 05:29 PM] emily#4444
LOL wake up at 4 pm and sleep at 6 am


[04-Jan-21 05:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@stacey Announce to management?


[04-Jan-21 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[04-Jan-21 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
Tag managers and seniors and just mention it to them


[04-Jan-21 05:30 PM] stacey#1000

Their fault


[04-Jan-21 05:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
it was on accounts that are like 2 months old so age wouldnt rlly have fixed that


[04-Jan-21 05:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
although they did have barely any friends / followers/ etc


[04-Jan-21 05:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
i could tell it was them because they said "daddy chill"


[04-Jan-21 05:38 PM] Beartikal#9760

[04-Jan-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Jan-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
alt accs are so easy to find


[04-Jan-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
people are bad at acting like it’s not an alt


[04-Jan-21 05:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@stacey 

I'm here to let you guys know that the HR Team doesn't review #hinting-reports anymore, which means we're only checking it to research a user. (A decline or accept reaction will not be added to past or future hinting report.)

Fine?


[04-Jan-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[04-Jan-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
I should’ve mentioned that at meeting but it’s all good


[04-Jan-21 06:04 PM] emily#4444
idk if u guys know but wyatt has botted the server before and has told kenzi and claire how to do it and i think they want to jsyk :ratdog:

[04-Jan-21 06:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Idk how credible she is but I think it’s worth investigating Uni. We’ve had many suspicions on her in the past but we’ve never investigated


[04-Jan-21 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
there has been MULTIPLE suspicions of uni leaking in the past


[04-Jan-21 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
mainly beacuse of how close she is with CB's


[04-Jan-21 06:10 PM] lyss#0709
i would agree


[04-Jan-21 06:11 PM] lyss#0709
if it isnt galaxypixel who leaked to sierra before he was terminated, then uni would be a top suspect


[04-Jan-21 06:12 PM] cory!#8287
did u guys question her about leaking already tho


[04-Jan-21 06:12 PM] cory!#8287
or am i thinking of someone else


[04-Jan-21 06:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
That was Aidan


[04-Jan-21 06:12 PM] cory!#8287
ah okay


[04-Jan-21 06:12 PM] cory!#8287
is she in a cb server or something


[04-Jan-21 06:13 PM] cory!#8287
do those still exist


[04-Jan-21 06:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Probably, we don’t know exactly because staceys alt discord account that was in one of the CB discord servers got kicked


[04-Jan-21 06:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
But she’s been in cb servers in the past


[04-Jan-21 06:13 PM] cory!#8287
yikes alright


[04-Jan-21 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
@Tattoblue it could also be aiden


[04-Jan-21 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
before kylie was fired, she said he leaked but had no proof


[04-Jan-21 06:16 PM] cory!#8287
@Tattoblue u said like kylie as in diorsglare sent u that right


[04-Jan-21 06:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828

its ayesha


[04-Jan-21 06:18 PM] cory!#8287

hadley begged to get banned now shes complaining ab it


[04-Jan-21 07:08 PM] ethan;#0003
they think they are cool


[04-Jan-21 07:08 PM] ethan;#0003
when nobody can take them serious when they type like that in a document


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] lyss#0709
hadley dmed me all concerned about her ban and i explained it to her very respectfully, and then she goes and leaks our dms


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] lyss#0709
so


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] lyss#0709
whatever i guess!


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
Here is all of evidence to goodbye Hadley. I don’t regret banning her and idgaf who wants to assume stuff about why she’s banned without knowing the full story

I feel like Sierra wrote this


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] lyss#0709
i was thinking that too


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
She thought she was never going to get banned because we are “biased” and ban people randomly.


[04-Jan-21 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
She earned herself a ban I was not going to tolerate her causing drama in general discussion.


[04-Jan-21 07:10 PM] lyss#0709
i dont get how im "biased" for not banning lissa, the only reason i didnt was bc no one actually REPORTED it to me, they just complained about it and had no valid argument


[04-Jan-21 07:10 PM] lyss#0709
but oh well


[04-Jan-21 07:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
because the only thing ive gotten is something from Sierra about lisa


[04-Jan-21 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
This is exactly why the formers are seen as toxic.


[04-Jan-21 07:11 PM] stacey#1000
That’s how I will always see them because every single time there is an issue in general discussion it’s involving a former.


[04-Jan-21 07:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
..."all she was doing was asking for her talkative role"...*closes the document*


[04-Jan-21 07:13 PM] stacey#1000
Yep there’s people assuming stuff and thinking they know everything about why people got banned


[04-Jan-21 07:15 PM] cory!#8287

omg pls u can take this one back i dont want it, ive already been the star of a tea doc in 2019

When the bloxton gd bus starts to get on a good road...it always somehow  makes a wrong turn and finds a road with a bunch of potholes


[04-Jan-21 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and then crashes into a brick wall


[04-Jan-21 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003

NGL I THINK THAT DOC MIGHT BE MADE BY DAIS_IES


[04-Jan-21 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
she made docs in the past


[04-Jan-21 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
she was banned today


[04-Jan-21 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
was pissy about it


[04-Jan-21 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
It’s made by one of the formers that don’t agree with a simple username rule


[04-Jan-21 07:22 PM] ethan;#0003
daisies


[04-Jan-21 07:22 PM] ethan;#0003
didnt agree


[04-Jan-21 07:22 PM] ethan;#0003
she was banned because of it


[04-Jan-21 07:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
soooo......they really mad over a bloxton server rule that's been there?


[04-Jan-21 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
Not my fault if people want to be immature and act out over the simplest rule


[04-Jan-21 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
they are pissy that we are enforcing a rule that should of always been enforced 😢


[04-Jan-21 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
We had to start enforcing it because they were abusing it and almost caused me to ban the wrong person :DDD


[04-Jan-21 07:24 PM] cory!#8287
idk why hadleys complaining when she wanted to get banned 😐


[04-Jan-21 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
I was looking at gd the whole time and Hadley was causing the most drama


[04-Jan-21 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
You can have an opinion on something but when you choose to be disrespectful to people about it and cause drama at the point you get banned


[04-Jan-21 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
The things they were saying to a management for trying to get them to stop was no ty


[04-Jan-21 07:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmmm, a management mention an idea to like make a !check command to signal that someone chatlogs need to be checked. So a helper doesn't have to chase down a management or remind them that their trainee needs to be checked


[04-Jan-21 07:29 PM] stacey#1000
Not a bad idea but also don’t really see the need in it either


[04-Jan-21 07:29 PM] stacey#1000
Cause managers are always roaming and supervising


[04-Jan-21 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
So they will see when someone is done and needs to be checked


[04-Jan-21 07:30 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think it was for like big servers with a bunch of trainees


[04-Jan-21 07:30 PM] KjRBLX#2053
because a lot may finish at the same time


[04-Jan-21 07:30 PM] stacey#1000
Oh true


[04-Jan-21 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
Not a bad idea but not sure how it would work still


[04-Jan-21 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
Cause even if it’s a bigger server


[04-Jan-21 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
People would still have to wait to get checked


[04-Jan-21 07:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But instead of being bombarded and trying to remember everyone who needs to be checked they could look around for a signal


[04-Jan-21 07:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I had a big server once and I didn't know what to do but like tell them to hold out a cookie to signal you need to be checked and just wait for someone to come and check you


[04-Jan-21 07:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
then pm admins that like anyone holding a cookie most likely needs to be checked


[04-Jan-21 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
It could work idk


[04-Jan-21 07:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053

@cory! I had her screenshare some of her DMs


[05-Jan-21 10:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
in a call


[05-Jan-21 10:05 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@cory! And she'd disconnect randomly then not respond for like a minute or so.. she didn't want to show her DMs with flyro because they were too personal which could be true but could also be her trying to cover up.. and also Ayesha sent me this

oh and i also asked her to open up discord through google chrome because it was possible for her to be logged into another account and she said that she was but it was a school discord account or something


[05-Jan-21 10:07 AM] Tattoblue#5828
like she dms her irl friends on that account


[05-Jan-21 10:08 AM] cory!#8287
school discord? that’s new


[05-Jan-21 10:08 AM] cory!#8287
I thought people used zoom or Google meet


[05-Jan-21 10:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
no not for like school school but


[05-Jan-21 10:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
she said she uses that account to DM her irl friends


[05-Jan-21 10:08 AM] cory!#8287
ohhh ok


[05-Jan-21 11:01 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[05-Jan-21 11:01 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[05-Jan-21 11:02 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[05-Jan-21 11:02 AM] cory!#8287

Sierra is making stuff up saying it was sent on an alt to try to avoid getting whoever it is in trouble


[05-Jan-21 11:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah sierra isnt always truthful


[05-Jan-21 11:05 AM] stacey#1000
she is trying to protect uni and is probably making up there is someone else leaking to try to make us turn to someone else


[05-Jan-21 11:06 AM] cory!#8287
ye she said it was a boy manager which caught me off guard a little


[05-Jan-21 11:06 AM] stacey#1000

welp she was lying about the alt part


[05-Jan-21 11:07 AM] stacey#1000
Sierra legit has nothing to lose and is already blacklisted so I wouldn’t go to Sierra about anything


[05-Jan-21 11:08 AM] stacey#1000
She’s likely making up there is 3 people leaking to her too


[05-Jan-21 11:08 AM] stacey#1000
Probably just uni


[05-Jan-21 11:08 AM] cory!#8287
yeah


[05-Jan-21 11:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
tbh i think its enough proof to fire uni considering the background knowledge we have


[05-Jan-21 11:08 AM] cory!#8287
maybe but idk


[05-Jan-21 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
We need to try to get a confession out of uni


[05-Jan-21 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
Tell uni we already know and it’s best not to lie at this point


[05-Jan-21 11:10 AM] cory!#8287
yeah that’s what I told galaxy and he just confessed that it was him


[05-Jan-21 11:10 AM] cory!#8287
probably will work for uni as well like u said


[05-Jan-21 11:11 AM] lyss#0709
hopefully that'll work


[05-Jan-21 11:18 AM] anna#0004
arent we only allowed to fire now if its like really important info that has been leaked?


[05-Jan-21 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
If they leak staff lounge, they leak


[05-Jan-21 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
Leaking is leaking so they get fired for it especially if they leaked multiple photos of it


[05-Jan-21 11:25 AM] Tattoblue#5828
and who knows how long uni's been leaking for


[05-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah we’ve been sus of her since like the summer

He also told me kylie asked him what happened to galaxy but he said he doesnt know how she knows and he said he doesnt know


[05-Jan-21 11:36 AM] KjRBLX#2053
She probably was in that server where libby really revealed he was fired


[05-Jan-21 11:37 AM] KjRBLX#2053
He said they’re multiple group chats but i  believe he said hes not in them


[05-Jan-21 11:38 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Hes kinda like people come and tell him what happened in gcs but he’s not in them

3 different people

why in the world would kj *have* to step in, like if thats what it would have taken for them to realize that disrespecting another mr was not okay, then thats a problem on their end

[05-Jan-21 12:41 PM] cory!#8287

[05-Jan-21 12:42 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[05-Jan-21 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
Tell we she either confesses now or this will end and we can just terminate


[05-Jan-21 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
We have enough evidence to terminate at this point


[05-Jan-21 01:20 PM] lyss#0709
uni's suspended but shes still talking in gd since she has the nitro booster role


[05-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah, i wasnt able to remove the nitro booster role @lyss


[05-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i tried removing it but


[05-Jan-21 01:22 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[05-Jan-21 01:23 PM] lyss#0709
ah i see


[05-Jan-21 02:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Sometimes i tend to phase out when im in vc when im focus on something else..anyone who vcs with me knows that. I usually go quiet and tune out, but still it shouldnt take me to step in and stop them


[05-Jan-21 02:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I wasn’t really in the state to realize what was going on


[05-Jan-21 02:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If you want a more explanation, it will have to later.


[05-Jan-21 02:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[05-Jan-21 03:51 PM] stacey#1000

ok but why does flyro keep involving himself for absolutely no reason


[05-Jan-21 04:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
they do know that people can decide if they wanna be anonymous right?


[05-Jan-21 04:05 PM] lyss#0709
nothing that goes on between the hr team or even the mr team is remotely his business or concern like what


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
LEE!?


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
I dont think its lee


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
I think its aidan or poky


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
Im asking for Kelly to send me evidence of her dms with lee


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
even if he supposedly deleted it


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] lyss#0709
yeah they could easily just be throwing anyone's name out there and it doesnt seem like something lee would do


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
it is someone in the bst time


[05-Jan-21 04:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Poky is pst


[05-Jan-21 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
aidan is


[05-Jan-21 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
bst?


[05-Jan-21 04:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[05-Jan-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000

yikess


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so she’s claiming lee leaked and is threatening her? hmmmm that doesn’t sound like lee though


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] cory!#8287
yeah ik


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
yeah thats why im trying to get her to send evidence of dms


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
plus if it was lee you think he wouldve leaked management stuff too


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
only staff announcements was leaked


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
so its a head


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
that is bst timezone


[05-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
and is close to kelly


[05-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
we should just stop announcing terminations


[05-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
people are just going to keep leaking them


[05-Jan-21 04:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i agree


[05-Jan-21 04:17 PM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Jan-21 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
clearly the mrs have proven they dont deserve to know that stuff if they keep leaking


[05-Jan-21 04:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Was the screenshots u sent in dm all the proof u have


[05-Jan-21 04:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
no theres more


[05-Jan-21 04:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Provide everything including ones from earlier pls


[05-Jan-21 04:18 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ok


[05-Jan-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
maybe we could consider closing sl too until someone confesses thats worked before


[05-Jan-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[05-Jan-21 04:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I was gonna say what if we just announced to managers cause in all honestly managers are more trust worthy than heads but idk 🤷🏻‍♂️


[05-Jan-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
Kelly is taking quite awhile to get evidence of Lee's dms


[05-Jan-21 04:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sheee sure is


[05-Jan-21 04:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
little sus if you ask me


[05-Jan-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
I for sure think its a head


[05-Jan-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
can we just shut down sl


[05-Jan-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
we've done it before


[05-Jan-21 04:23 PM] stacey#1000
too many leakers rn


[05-Jan-21 04:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Like ik it's very probable that it was uni but what bothers me is we don't really have 100% concrete evidence. Sierra is a big fucking liar and I know that when I used to be friends with her, so I don't really see the point in believing anything that comes out her mouth. She claims her innocence and ik people can lie but what do we do if we can't even send evidence becusee of someone being anonymous + if we sent the evidence we have we would defo get backlash


[05-Jan-21 04:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@bonnie591 When I was interviewing her, I asked her to log into discord through google chrome


[05-Jan-21 04:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
she didn't want to


[05-Jan-21 04:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
she acknowledged that she had another account


[05-Jan-21 04:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
discord account


[05-Jan-21 04:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
on google chrome


[05-Jan-21 04:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
I mean I'm pretty sure it's her but

[05-Jan-21 04:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
Idk in the future I want to make how we deal with reports-


[05-Jan-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
i asked her to show me proof its his discord name and tag and if there is dms from today she can send


[05-Jan-21 04:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
I don't honestly care until I see a gif of discord being refreshed on less dms + his id being copied as proof can be photoshopped these days


[05-Jan-21 04:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Another thing that bugs me is like reports we get a few months after it happened


[05-Jan-21 04:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
And if someone wishes to remain anonymous


[05-Jan-21 04:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
That picture she sent looks sus


[05-Jan-21 04:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
Is it right to use that proof as like we can't send it to them


[05-Jan-21 04:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Took that long to get that picture


[05-Jan-21 04:28 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jan-21 04:29 PM] lyss#0709
she didn't plan this out very well


[05-Jan-21 04:29 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@bonnie591 yeah its really annoying not being able to show proof because if you show proof they have to come up with something fast


[05-Jan-21 04:29 PM] Tattoblue#5828
but if u cant show proof to the person being reported they can continue to lie


[05-Jan-21 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
if she doesnt show me proof of dms today and prove its his discord name and tag im not buying it

imogen doesnt seem like the type to leak, she rarely involves herself with other people outside of her friend group i believe


[05-Jan-21 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
she never said anything about an alt until i called her out


[05-Jan-21 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
it can be anyone at this point


[05-Jan-21 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
but obv we are going to need to suspend lee for questioning possibly


[05-Jan-21 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
a head could also be lying about their timezone


[05-Jan-21 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
kelly immediately goes to have dinner supposedly after I call her out


[05-Jan-21 04:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that’s always the excuse 😶


[05-Jan-21 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
With the evidence you posted above?


[05-Jan-21 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
not rn but im saying possibly yeah


[05-Jan-21 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
im waiting to get more proof from her


[05-Jan-21 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
i genuinly dont think its lee


[05-Jan-21 04:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
I don't approve until I see:

-a gif of them refreshing discord
-a gif of getting his discord id


[05-Jan-21 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
thats what im asking for


[05-Jan-21 04:36 PM] Tattoblue#5828
termination announcements cause more harm than good theres no point anymore


[05-Jan-21 04:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
I basically just told flyro he has no involvement and he stopped


[05-Jan-21 04:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok they should all be deleted


[05-Jan-21 04:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think


[05-Jan-21 04:41 PM] stacey#1000
good


[05-Jan-21 04:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea or at least everything up to April last year


[05-Jan-21 04:43 PM] stacey#1000
someone gets terminated, the mr team will have to figure out on their own they are gone


[05-Jan-21 04:45 PM] lyss#0709
i wonder when they'll notice that the termination announcements are no more


[05-Jan-21 04:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
probably soon lmao. someone’s gonna be like “what happened to termination announcements” then everyone’s gonna be like “huh what where”

imag for sure has the experience, time, and activity on her shoulders, but she lacks in many other qualities


[05-Jan-21 04:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what aboutttttt


[05-Jan-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jan-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jan-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
I was thinking OMER but hes not really active rn


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
and he doesnt really show HR qualities to me


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Ace is good but she’s really really really new but


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I was gonna say Omer too but remember we still have them on their break so maybe once that ends he’ll get active again


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Tattoblue#5828
If she continues to


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Tattoblue#5828
So what she’s doing


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Then in the future ace


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] cory!#8287
yeah maybe omer


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Ace would be a good one but yeah she’s a bit too new


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
im thinking ace, maya, maybe omer


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] Fraux#7971
since we aren’t announcing the terminations and reasons anymore, maybe just announce who is termed. also another reason i understand why it was a good thing to have is bc it keeps rules clear to MRs about what rules and things they do can get them fired. ive noticed sometimes them saying how rules aren’t clear and can be changed a lot and this can help clarify.... but idk


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] lyss#0709
ive never, ever really felt respected or welcomed by omer whatsoever tbh


[05-Jan-21 04:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
I watched sesamert yt video on bloxton and they said why did @xM_inn get bod in 14 months when imag been here for years

[05-Jan-21 05:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Mendo is good


[05-Jan-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
mendo has had issues with maturity


[05-Jan-21 05:02 PM] cory!#8287
i see willow a decent amount


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
but he might be good now


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sowbex is good


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Mendo is


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Rude


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
i still say kyle and sowbex next


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] lyss#0709
im close with mendo and willow too and they both have really amazing personalities, not to mention their activity is off the charts in my opinion


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’ve never seen him be rude


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
How is he rude


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
is tati still getting promoted or are we like cancelling her promo and voting someone else


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] lyss#0709
ive never seen any negative qualities from mendo


[05-Jan-21 05:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[05-Jan-21 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
she is back and active now but


[05-Jan-21 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
idk im just thinking maybe its possible to just vote 2 new people and give tati more time


[05-Jan-21 05:04 PM] lyss#0709
i rlly want benson and kyle for the next seniors whenever that is, and then id vote for mendo and willow the next vote if theyre still active


[05-Jan-21 05:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Idk how to explain but you know if you want mendo sure. I might be more eh if they were get into a shift vote


[05-Jan-21 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I feel like Tati will be that senior to be active for like couple months and then die


[05-Jan-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 is it even possible to like cancel tati's promo and vote 2 new people or


[05-Jan-21 05:05 PM] lyss#0709

yeah and possibly pzoky and aivdan leaking :FLUSHED:


[05-Jan-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
former MRs are making fake evidence to try to get people fired and protect the people actually leaking


[05-Jan-21 05:43 PM] lyss#0709
just a minor observation that liv never uses capital letters at the beginning of sentences in dms as is depicted in some of the screenshots


[05-Jan-21 05:44 PM] lyss#0709
but maybe thats just me hoping its not real i suppose


[05-Jan-21 05:45 PM] stacey#1000
no the evidence bonnie said looks real fake


[05-Jan-21 05:45 PM] stacey#1000
the lee stuff I got looks fake too


[05-Jan-21 05:45 PM] stacey#1000
no real evidence of him leaking


[05-Jan-21 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
so im not suspending him and questioning him


[05-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like I highly doubt Lee is the kind of person to leak. That’s just the kinda person he is


[05-Jan-21 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
yeah considering lee freaked out over a minor warning


[05-Jan-21 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
he wouldnt do anything on purpose like that it seems


[05-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
right


[05-Jan-21 05:48 PM] lyss#0709
yeahh lee has never seemed like the type to do that sort of thing in my eyes


[05-Jan-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
but then again


[05-Jan-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
u never really know people I guess


[05-Jan-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
but ya im just gonna let this go no real evidence to go off of


[05-Jan-21 05:54 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i heard from quan but it was because i asked him to host and said no


[05-Jan-21 05:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey I seen him online on roblox earlier and I’ve seen him playing other video games via his discord status but no


[05-Jan-21 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
but like he has an expired over a month old inactive notice


[05-Jan-21 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
so


[05-Jan-21 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
time to get a move on sending him an inactive notice letter

[05-Jan-21 05:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey well technically we can’t really hold any inactivity against him rn but I agree he’s inactive. I discussed this with Bonnie week we gave them their break. As soon as it ends I’m going to send his inactivity letter cause I told him he needs to improve his activity  during the last week of November and nothing


[05-Jan-21 05:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
Me and bloo already discussed-


[05-Jan-21 05:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
We are gonna see


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
he didnt do anything before the


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
After break is over


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
excused thing


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
If he doesn't do anything in the first week back he gets a strike for inactive


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
ok ill leave that thing up for now


[05-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Then one more strike is demotion

Yes but that’s cause I had given him two weeks and by that time we talked about giving seniors like a 3 weeks break


[05-Jan-21 05:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don’t think he’s improved much hence why ill be sending his notice after it ends AND we’re not gonna approve any of his notices cause at this point it’s been to much. So if anyone see’s that he attempts to put up a inactive notice, don’t accept it


[05-Jan-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000

It’s only cause she was inactive and just came back

[06-Jan-21 12:28 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean I don’t think Kyle would lie about it cause he’s pretty trustworthy


[06-Jan-21 12:28 AM] courtney#5125
^^


[06-Jan-21 12:28 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well then, that’s awkward 😶


[06-Jan-21 12:28 AM] stacey#1000
Well


[06-Jan-21 12:29 AM] stacey#1000
Rip


[06-Jan-21 12:29 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk how everyone else feels about that but I mean personally that takes away wanting to get him promoted to  senior


[06-Jan-21 12:29 AM] courtney#5125
yeah at least for this vote


[06-Jan-21 12:29 AM] stacey#1000
Idk who else to vote for senior


[06-Jan-21 12:29 AM] stacey#1000
Kyle told me about the hinting too but it was like a month ago and I forgot about it


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] lyss#0709
and kyle was insanely stressed about it even after i repeatedly told him that benson would not find out that kyle told me. so i highly, highly doubt kyle would put in 30 minutes of panicking about it just for it to be a lie


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
And there was no solid evidence either


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
Kyle was stressed telling me too I remember


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
He told me in a vc


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
And was afraid he would get benson fired


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
And I told him hinting is not major and we cannot fire people for it


[06-Jan-21 12:30 AM] courtney#5125
yeah and kyles a very trustworthy person, hes proven that


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Well I honestly don’t know who else I would vote for.


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
Kyle was a senior management already so I trust him


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
any ideas


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
No


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
rip let me have a look at current managers


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
Why did benson have to go hinting


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
Bruh he’s so active and ahsossbdnsush


[06-Jan-21 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
Hinting is not major or anything so I still want to see him as senior some day but


[06-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
This sucks


[06-Jan-21 12:32 AM] lyss#0709
i agree


[06-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
When did benson last hint


[06-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
Was it recently?


[06-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
Cause Kyle told me like a month ago


[06-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
And then I forgot


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
What about


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
Vac for senior


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
I was thinking vac before


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Today has just been like dang


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
I get he has had issues in past but like he’s improved


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] stacey#1000
And he’s active, been manager for awhile


[06-Jan-21 12:33 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I was gonna say Builder is another good one but he got promoted in august. I mean it’s not recently but I feel like he still needs a bit more time as a manager


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
I was just about to say him


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
He’s been doing so well with dealing with drama in general discussion


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Definitely might consider for next senior vote


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
Remaining professional, etc


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
He’s been a manager for over 3 months


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
Might be ready now tbh


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
Took me 3 months to get senior


[06-Jan-21 12:34 AM] lyss#0709
what about jackson or mendo? emma (roxie) is a good one too but hasnt been in her position as long


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709
id vote emma before i voted builder


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah but we also have other managers who have been here longer we could definitely consider


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
What do you think of vac


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709
vac is very


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
He’s been manager a long time


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk, how is vac


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709
to put it plainly, hes rude


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I personally haven’t really heard -


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oh


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
Is there evidence of him being rude


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I personally haven’t seen it recently


[06-Jan-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709
and it seems like he thinks hes better than others


[06-Jan-21 12:36 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I know vac tends to help a lot of themed sessions if I’m not mistaken, but what about just regular sessions


[06-Jan-21 12:36 AM] lyss#0709
i personally just notice that he acts pretty stuck up


[06-Jan-21 12:36 AM] stacey#1000
He was at my trainings today


[06-Jan-21 12:36 AM] stacey#1000
And goes to sessions a lot


[06-Jan-21 12:36 AM] stacey#1000
I haven’t noticed him act at all like that


[06-Jan-21 12:36 AM] lyss#0709
id possibly vote for him in the future but id personally rather have mendo or jackson first


[06-Jan-21 12:37 AM] stacey#1000
But for sure not promoting benson rn cause if we promoted benson and Kyle together. Well I don’t think Kyle would like that at all


[06-Jan-21 12:37 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I personally haven’t either but I’m sure lyss wouldn’t lie about him being rude. Not sure what you’ve seen Vac do but I trust your word for it


[06-Jan-21 12:37 AM] stacey#1000
How long has Jackson been a manager


[06-Jan-21 12:37 AM] stacey#1000

mitch also isnt the most active anymore

I forgot Saab was a manager shes so inactive


[06-Jan-21 12:43 AM] lyss#0709
willow is another manager from the australian timezone, and shes been in her position since april


[06-Jan-21 12:43 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t see them but it’s cause of time zones


[06-Jan-21 12:43 AM] lyss#0709
and shes got just the best personality, id for sure vote for her if she was a candidate


[06-Jan-21 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
Only thing is we don’t have any HRs that host for that timezone


[06-Jan-21 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t see them at all because of my timezone


[06-Jan-21 12:44 AM] lyss#0709
i mean anything past like 8 pm cst is a time they usually are available


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] stacey#1000
At this point I legit don’t know who to vote for except for sure Kyle because I want to see Kyle as senior again


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] lyss#0709
i see willow and jackson at probably every single session i host at 10 and 11 pm cst


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] stacey#1000
I was senior with Kyle for awhile before he resigned


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] lyss#0709
yeah i really want kyle as a senior again


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] stacey#1000
He was a good senior and regretted resigning


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] stacey#1000
So now he’s earnt his way back up there


[06-Jan-21 12:45 AM] lyss#0709
i think hes also getting a bit bored with management


[06-Jan-21 12:46 AM] lyss#0709
he hates to show it but

Yeah that’s what happened with holly


[06-Jan-21 12:46 AM] lyss#0709
and hes ready either way


[06-Jan-21 12:46 AM] stacey#1000
While we looking at managers let’s get rid of some inactive ones


[06-Jan-21 12:46 AM] lyss#0709
yeah he'll always joke about wanting to resign in a few months but i wouldnt be surprised at all if he actually felt that way


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] stacey#1000
When’s the last time you saw Saab


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ikkk he always tells me that and I can’t tell if he’s joking or not


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] lyss#0709
i havent seen her at a session in months


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] stacey#1000
Does she have a notice


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] lyss#0709
yeah bloo i always basically beg him to not resign bc he'd regret it


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I forgot saab was a manager


[06-Jan-21 12:47 AM] lyss#0709
yes i believe she does still


[06-Jan-21 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
Oh she does


[06-Jan-21 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
But still


[06-Jan-21 12:48 AM] lyss#0709
kyle's just such a good candidate rn, like itd be a great loss if he resigned


[06-Jan-21 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
Kyle for sure will win


[06-Jan-21 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
But we def cannot promote benson with him


[06-Jan-21 12:48 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Imagine if he resigned the day we were gonna promote him


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] lyss#0709
shes been inactive for quite a while, but she does have a lot of high level course work


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] lyss#0709
bloo DONT JINX IT


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] stacey#1000
I feel like if we promoted Kyle with benson. Kyle would be very upset


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
NFJEMDKDKD *knocks on wood*


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah definitely


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] lyss#0709
i was just talking to bonnie today about how what if something happens with kyle or benson


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] lyss#0709
and look what happened!!!


[06-Jan-21 12:49 AM] stacey#1000
I had to convince holly to stay cause she was so bored of manager she was going to quit not long before she got senior


[06-Jan-21 12:50 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well we can see what the other Hrs say and probably come to a conclusion or have someone in mind we will also promo


[06-Jan-21 12:50 AM] stacey#1000
I wanted to see benson as senior this is sad


[06-Jan-21 12:50 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Same


[06-Jan-21 12:50 AM] stacey#1000
Hinting is not even major but still bad idea to promote him now


[06-Jan-21 12:50 AM] lyss#0709
hopefully he can still win a future vote if he doesnt hint anymore


[06-Jan-21 12:51 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Sucks the day we were like “yeah benson and Kyle!” Benson had to hint 🥲


[06-Jan-21 12:51 AM] stacey#1000
Benson will probably get mad Kyle will get promoted and then quit


[06-Jan-21 12:51 AM] lyss#0709
the irony of this is painful


[06-Jan-21 12:51 AM] lyss#0709
yeah kyle is very


[06-Jan-21 12:51 AM] lyss#0709
upset


[06-Jan-21 12:52 AM] stacey#1000
I legit dk who else to vote for now


[06-Jan-21 12:52 AM] lyss#0709
and i had to reassure him like at least 50 times that benson would not hear about it or know that it was kyle, and hes still on edge about it bc of how close they are


[06-Jan-21 12:53 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
did we consider mendo. I mean besides Bonnie saying he’s rude personally I’ve never seen it from him or I don’t think it’s ever been a problem where it’s been reported? Idk


[06-Jan-21 12:53 AM] lyss#0709
i have no idea who to vote for besides kyle


[06-Jan-21 12:53 AM] lyss#0709
yeah my top picks would be willow, mendo, or jackson


[06-Jan-21 12:53 AM] lyss#0709
willow and mendo being like way up here


[06-Jan-21 12:53 AM] stacey#1000
Honestly we have held mendo back for so long at this point


[06-Jan-21 12:53 AM] stacey#1000
We should just give him a chance


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] stacey#1000
He’s been manager a long time


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] lyss#0709
its mendo's TIME 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🥲🥲🥲🥲


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll vote for mendo


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] stacey#1000
Mendo is a diff timezone too


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] lyss#0709
yes mendo im rooting for u buddy 🙏🏻


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] stacey#1000
Mendo and Kyle


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Alright, I can give mendo a shot


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] lyss#0709
mendo and kyle will bring activity wayayyayayyyyy up


[06-Jan-21 12:54 AM] stacey#1000
When did he get manager


[06-Jan-21 12:55 AM] stacey#1000
Can I just delete sowbex card I added


[06-Jan-21 12:55 AM] stacey#1000
I added mendo instead


[06-Jan-21 12:55 AM] lyss#0709
theyre at sessions and shifts like at least 5 hours total every day


[06-Jan-21 12:55 AM] stacey#1000
I’m deleting sowbex card


[06-Jan-21 12:55 AM] lyss#0709
yup yup good call


[06-Jan-21 12:56 AM] lyss#0709
ill still be rooting for benson in the future as long as he doesnt hint anymore 🙏🏻🥲


[06-Jan-21 12:56 AM] stacey#1000
Yep


[06-Jan-21 12:56 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
He got management


[06-Jan-21 12:56 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
on may 1st


[06-Jan-21 12:56 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think


[06-Jan-21 12:57 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Or 2nd


[06-Jan-21 12:57 AM] stacey#1000
Omg mendo been manager since may let’s go


[06-Jan-21 12:57 AM] stacey#1000
His time to shine


[06-Jan-21 12:57 AM] stacey#1000
He’s been manager longer then benson


[06-Jan-21 12:58 AM] stacey#1000
I’m considering Addie for senior too


[06-Jan-21 12:58 AM] stacey#1000
For next vote


[06-Jan-21 01:02 AM] lyss#0709
me TOO i love addie


[06-Jan-21 01:48 AM] lyss#0709
so benson has apparently somewhat trash talked some other managers, really just going down the list of managers and calling them inactive. that is until he reaches his own name and says things like "100%, perfect" so yeah i think thats it since we've stopped talking about that


[06-Jan-21 03:25 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank kinda suss that the person who reported liv made another account to report another mr? just forget about livs case for now


[06-Jan-21 04:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
i stg why does flyro get involved with everything


[06-Jan-21 06:59 AM] ethan;#0003
SUS


[06-Jan-21 06:59 AM] ethan;#0003
:Sus:


[06-Jan-21 07:10 AM] ethan;#0003
i think we should think about vac for senior


[06-Jan-21 07:10 AM] ethan;#0003
he has been a manager for almost a year now


[06-Jan-21 07:10 AM] ethan;#0003
and he has never been inactive


[06-Jan-21 10:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I’m thinking either vac or mendo


[06-Jan-21 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 let’s just ignore mr reports for now. Obv there is another leaker and lee was accused but it’s not him I highly doubt so I’m not bothering with it and people are just trying to get any mr fired at this point.


[06-Jan-21 11:05 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@ethan; we did but it was mentioned that Vac can be plainly rude sometimes


[06-Jan-21 11:06 AM] ethan;#0003
o


[06-Jan-21 11:06 AM] ethan;#0003
i dont notice that from him


[06-Jan-21 11:06 AM] ethan;#0003
idk others might


[06-Jan-21 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t notice it from him either


[06-Jan-21 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
It’s kinda like the same case with mendo


[06-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
We’ve held him back for being immature and rude, same thing with vac. But at the end of the day both are very active and I’ve not noticed issues with any recently.


[06-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
So like how long we going to hold them back for at this point.


[06-Jan-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
I might vote vac because he’s been a manager a lot longer then any other candidate, is active, and I myself have not noticed any rude behaviour from him


[06-Jan-21 11:23 AM] lyss#0709
im leaning towards mendo this time but id probably vote for vac next time if he doesnt win this vote


[06-Jan-21 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
I’m between vac and mendo


[06-Jan-21 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
Vac been a manager a lot longer that’s the thing tho


[06-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
He was promoted in January 12th of last year whereas mendo was promoted in May.


[06-Jan-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
So vac been a manager like 4 months longer then mendo


[06-Jan-21 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
So I might vote him just because of that

[06-Jan-21 07:02 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah he was


[06-Jan-21 07:02 PM] cory!#8287
ohhh


[06-Jan-21 07:03 PM] cory!#8287
did he know? doesnt look like he knew


[06-Jan-21 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
No


[06-Jan-21 07:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@cory! I think he knew, he got banned in September for bypassing his discord ban


[06-Jan-21 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
He was legit highly involved with cbs


[06-Jan-21 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
When I was in the cb server on an alt


[06-Jan-21 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
He loved trash talking


[06-Jan-21 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
Well


[06-Jan-21 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
It has been awhile so maybe


[06-Jan-21 07:05 PM] cory!#8287
oh then yeah prob no


[06-Jan-21 07:05 PM] cory!#8287
if he bypassed his discord ban


[06-Jan-21 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
But I still don’t like how he was highly involved with cbs and trash talking myself and others so


[06-Jan-21 07:05 PM] stacey#1000
I vote no for that


[06-Jan-21 07:06 PM] Tattoblue#5828
He’s a former MR too so he should definetly know @cory!


[06-Jan-21 07:06 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I think he got to head in like 2018 or 2019


[06-Jan-21 07:06 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[06-Jan-21 07:06 PM] stacey#1000
He also tried getting promoted again while actively trash talking etc


[06-Jan-21 07:07 PM] stacey#1000
I still have old photos of him being involved in the cb server


[06-Jan-21 07:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
He’s a former MR too so he should definetly know @cory!


[06-Jan-21 07:09 PM] cory!#8287
yeah exactly


[06-Jan-21 07:10 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Idk why that sent twice


[06-Jan-21 07:10 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Oops


[06-Jan-21 07:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[06-Jan-21 07:16 PM] stacey#1000

@Beartikal I don’t either but when he was a HR he’d always say no offense lol


[06-Jan-21 09:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
hey guys if a user changes their discord account verified user and they had Talkative, what happens to their Talkative role


[06-Jan-21 09:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like they chance the roblox account verified with their discord?


[06-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
yea


[06-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
and what if it changes to one thats < 30 days, etc.


[06-Jan-21 09:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
WE don't go through and check each individual.


[06-Jan-21 09:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
ook


[06-Jan-21 09:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So the only time we would catch them


[06-Jan-21 09:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
is if they tried to rejoin


[06-Jan-21 09:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
that answers my q


[06-Jan-21 11:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
people keep talking about the meeting room or asking when will there be a promotion


[06-Jan-21 11:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
(at my session)


[07-Jan-21 12:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
it will be posted under #rules -and-information in the Bloxton Discord for use by anyone.


[07-Jan-21 12:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
Simply clicking on the emoji will run through a series of checks and automate the granting of the Talkative Role.


[07-Jan-21 12:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
@here


[07-Jan-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
👍


[07-Jan-21 12:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can also adjust it whenever by editing the code although it goes in effect for future members


[07-Jan-21 12:31 AM] stacey#1000
no more getting annoying pings of people being impatient to get talkative in tickets!!!


[07-Jan-21 12:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
i've also automated ranking of application cards that are in the "passed" list which occurs automatically every 30 minutes


[07-Jan-21 12:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
via trello


[07-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000

[07-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
oh yeah I forgot a senior mentioned to me that the passing list thing at interviews


[07-Jan-21 12:32 AM] stacey#1000
when they click rank it doesnt say ranked to this rank like at trainings and they get confused


[07-Jan-21 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
ah ok


[07-Jan-21 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
i manually copy and pasted code so maybe i forgot a piece


[07-Jan-21 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
ill add it in

@Beartikal can the bot do anything for like requesting MRs at hotel. Idk a lot of people have just requested for like a new way to ask for assistance at the hotel by adding like a channel in the discord instead


[07-Jan-21 02:16 AM] stacey#1000
Idk what you think of that idea tho


[07-Jan-21 05:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah like a command which sends a message to an mr+ channel saying they need assistance


[07-Jan-21 05:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
or


[07-Jan-21 05:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
maybe something like a ticket system


[07-Jan-21 05:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
which tbh i could easily set up with the current one


[07-Jan-21 05:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
where it makes a new channel where u can communicate


[07-Jan-21 05:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey how does that sound. i could make a new category for tickets which people can create a ticket and mr+ can review


[07-Jan-21 05:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
if bear wants to make it with his own bot he can but we could have that as a system until then to try it out


[07-Jan-21 05:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank vote on what i just said

{Reactions}
check (9) cross 

[07-Jan-21 05:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
mrs wont be able to view the normal tickets, just the need mr tickets


[07-Jan-21 05:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
how about #access-pending channel as thats where u make talkative tickets rn so staff cant get it


[07-Jan-21 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 sounds good. And are you still going to make a gamenight tag role thing too


[07-Jan-21 11:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think bear said he was gonna do that with the bot but i can add a reaction role thing to the server if needed


[07-Jan-21 11:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey


[07-Jan-21 12:13 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that would work @bonnie591


[07-Jan-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 there are too many tickets


[07-Jan-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
that the Mr call ones


[07-Jan-21 01:58 PM] ethan;#0003
are going to the top of the discord server


[07-Jan-21 01:58 PM] ethan;#0003
and mrs cant view the ones up there


[07-Jan-21 01:58 PM] ethan;#0003
i think there should be a seperate discord for MR calls


[07-Jan-21 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 https://i.imgur.com/BfdLRvG.png we should apply for a partnership with the ticket bot

Uh Megan is telling me she can’t see mr channels


[07-Jan-21 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
And she thinks she got fired


[07-Jan-21 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
Nvm


[07-Jan-21 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
I spam tagged her


[07-Jan-21 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
I love how the cbs are trying to appeal now to me when I saw all the trash talking they said about me on an alt


[07-Jan-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
r u sure because it sends it to that category. when a category is full (the normal ticket one is full) it sends it to the top


[07-Jan-21 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003
there was a ticket made requesting mr


[07-Jan-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
ill look into that!


[07-Jan-21 02:06 PM] ethan;#0003
and it was at the top


[07-Jan-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
might be glitched


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
we are probs one the servers who use it the most


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
so we 100% qualify for partnership


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah ill look at it tomorrow


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
and we will probs get the premium version of the bot


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
that works better


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
Just curious. Would you guys ever want like Diego, stinky those old cbs to appeal?


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
NO WAY


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
Cause they trying to appeal to me


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
And I’m like heck no


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
diego is like a terrorist


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
is diego the one who


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
They did so much trash talking


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
crashed gamenights


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
Diego sent me a friend request on discord and like


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can actually never appeal


[07-Jan-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
the one who was bff's with alistelle


[07-Jan-21 02:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can fuck off


[07-Jan-21 02:08 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like if I accept it he will dox me


[07-Jan-21 02:08 PM] stacey#1000
So I’m not accepting it


[07-Jan-21 02:08 PM] stacey#1000
He’s the one that exploited right


[07-Jan-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000

@bonnie591 planning on posting Talkative Reaction message in rules channel. When they react with a 🗣️, it runs through checks
1) verified with bloxlink
2) 30 days on roblox account
3) 30 days on discord account


[07-Jan-21 02:18 PM] bonnie591#0591

[07-Jan-21 02:18 PM] bonnie591#0591

[07-Jan-21 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
of course it wont work here since we are not in the bloxton discord

We could host a meeting at some point where we all could review them


[07-Jan-21 04:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Should I make two seperate list or just compile them into 1?


[07-Jan-21 04:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Just add them to the current idea list for now


[07-Jan-21 04:22 PM] bonnie591#0591

[07-Jan-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
i got lost its so long the rules she made


[07-Jan-21 05:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
I looked at them earlier today


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Not needed the rules we have now are fine


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
how do you feel about


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
And if we changed it to like rule 1 swearing it would confuse everything


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
updating the rules a bit


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
not all of them


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
But warn for swearing yes


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
but like yeah warn for swearing


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Unfair to just ban


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i dont mind warning for swearning


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] cory!#8287
unless they keep swearing and stuff after warned


[07-Jan-21 05:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
I could look we auto mod to see if it could auto warn


[07-Jan-21 05:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
At*


[07-Jan-21 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
ok so do i like


[07-Jan-21 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
just announce to managers to warn for first offence of swearing or


[07-Jan-21 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[07-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bonnie591 change message stating what to do in access-pending


[07-Jan-21 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
im not announcing to everyone


[07-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
the automatic talkative role is up


[07-Jan-21 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
I wanna host a meeting first for ideas so how about we review rules and info then @stacey


[07-Jan-21 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
And sure bear


[07-Jan-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 ok but im just going to make a small announcement to managers to warn for swearing and only ban if its excessive and they continue doing it after being warned


[07-Jan-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
just so they know


[07-Jan-21 05:49 PM] stacey#1000
u can plan a meeting for it sure thats a good idea


[07-Jan-21 05:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok sure


[07-Jan-21 05:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll remove the immediate ban bit from rules and info


[07-Jan-21 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
who is suppose to view access-pending


[07-Jan-21 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
employees cant view it (some dont have talkative role)


[07-Jan-21 05:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
Anyone has who has verified role but doesn't have a staff or talkative role


[07-Jan-21 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh


[07-Jan-21 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
so staff cant get talkative then


[07-Jan-21 05:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
or can thye already talk


[07-Jan-21 05:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Mhm no need because they can already talk with staff roles


[07-Jan-21 05:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[07-Jan-21 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591

[07-Jan-21 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591

mostly made it for debugging for bot stuff


[07-Jan-21 05:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
Now that is a good nurse


[07-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
also what do u think about adding a gamenight role for people @Beartikal


[07-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
so we dont have to tag here all the time in event announcements


[07-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
making an actual gamenight channel


[07-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's same as bloxlink but this one tells rank type!


[07-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea having reaction roles for it bear in rules and info


[07-Jan-21 05:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
sounds nice id have to add reaction role command first unless theres another bot with the same function


[07-Jan-21 05:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
better than pinging @ here tho


[07-Jan-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
there is a reaction bot


[07-Jan-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
u can add


[07-Jan-21 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Either bloxton bot or another bot


[07-Jan-21 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Up to u bear!


[07-Jan-21 05:59 PM] stacey#1000
there is legit a bot called ReactionBot

[07-Jan-21 06:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Beartikal do u wanna make game night pings a thing on bloxton bot or should I do the reaction bot thing tomorrow


[07-Jan-21 06:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
do reaction bot for now


[07-Jan-21 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
there needs to be two ones, one for envtops one for normal gamenights


[07-Jan-21 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003
🤣


[07-Jan-21 06:11 PM] ethan;#0003
cus people want to go to gamenights, but they dont want to go to envtops


[07-Jan-21 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
Envtops ping role but same channel


[07-Jan-21 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
But wait


[07-Jan-21 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
That's too many roles

[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] Polk#1596
hey guys im just wondering, does any of u do an account age check at interviews? i did an account age check rn just to experiment, and it turned out we got rid of 8 players! and that means 8 less people our MRs have to interview for no reason at all. im not sure if bear is cooking something up for this, but it might be worth to consider implementing this as a normal procedure @High Rank


[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] ethan;#0003
if they look sus


[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] ethan;#0003
i check age


[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] Polk#1596
the thing is


[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] ethan;#0003
but most of the time interviewers notify me


[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i dont check ages


[08-Jan-21 01:19 PM] Polk#1596
i just did it because now i dont have to watch out who i spam the rank button on the GUI


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
and it relieves stress for the interviewers


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] lyss#0709
ill let them get an interview but i have mrs tell me who has a low account age, and then i wont rank them sometimes


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
ya there was one with robux and 28 account age, i let it slide


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
hm ok


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
i think im gonna personally implement this because i dont rank them anyway


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] anna#0004
ya i do what lyss does


[08-Jan-21 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
and then i can just spam the rank button


[08-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
because last time there was like 5 people with a low account age and i had to wait an extra 5 minutes before ranking


[08-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
alr


[08-Jan-21 01:22 PM] Polk#1596
i doubt this violates any roblox ToS because we can kick as we please in game and it isnt an automatic kicking script


[08-Jan-21 01:22 PM] Polk#1596
so u guys can do it too


[08-Jan-21 01:36 PM] Polk#1596
hold on for now, gonna talk to baby and bear about this


[08-Jan-21 01:41 PM] stacey#1000
I check age at the end and if it’s low acc age I don’t rank them and just kick them saying ranked so they think they are ranked but I never do @Polk


[08-Jan-21 01:41 PM] stacey#1000
So they waste their time getting interviewed to not get ranked to hopefully get them to stop


[08-Jan-21 01:43 PM] Polk#1596
i used to do that too


[08-Jan-21 01:43 PM] Polk#1596
in fact, ive been doing that since ages ago up until now


[08-Jan-21 01:44 PM] Polk#1596
but im getting kinda tired of having to check that everytime so im looking into a new method


[08-Jan-21 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
I still do it now until there is something new added to prevent it


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
I also announced to seniors not to rank low acc age people


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] Polk#1596
i think its against roblox tos to have a script kicking them automatically


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
It is


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] Polk#1596
while doing it manually isnt, and it still gives us less work


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] Polk#1596
ya


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] stacey#1000
But the bot can just not rank low acc age people


[08-Jan-21 01:45 PM] Polk#1596
i was thinking about that too


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
and if it could kick people at interviews instead of letting them stay


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
they have nothing to do there just waiting in a line


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
So are you speaking to bear about a new better way


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
i ranked them 10 minutes ago and they were still standing there "when am i getting ranked??"


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
yes possibly


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
Can you also add this to your list


[08-Jan-21 01:46 PM] Polk#1596
and baby

[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] Polk#1596

[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] Polk#1596

[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] Polk#1596
yep i will bring that up too


[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] stacey#1000
I went on mobile as well


[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Jan-21 01:47 PM] stacey#1000

Can you do that @anna


[09-Jan-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
I really just want to nap


[09-Jan-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
But people won’t stop


[09-Jan-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
Attacking me


[09-Jan-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
Over a former mr role


[09-Jan-21 11:13 AM] anna#0004
ya, could u edit the ban to warn so we can vote on that


[09-Jan-21 11:13 AM] anna#0004
oh nvm!


[09-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
Ok you can remove former mr roles and warn ty!


[09-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
I fr nap now I don’t want to see how they act without former roles now


[09-Jan-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
They will probably just get worse to end up getting banned


[09-Jan-21 11:16 AM] anna#0004
yep dw, u can go. theyve been warned and former has been taken

she saw what happened to ayesha and lily and yet is continuing

thats just being a hypocrite


[09-Jan-21 11:33 AM] Polk#1596
we gave them the former MR role to acknowledge their hard work, then THEY break our trust and start acting up


[09-Jan-21 11:33 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Imagine if we were to just show all the stuff they did...


[09-Jan-21 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
so not sure who is truly getting "repaid" here


[09-Jan-21 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
yeah literally


[09-Jan-21 11:34 AM] Polk#1596
they sit on their high horse when they havent even seen 5% of everything we know


[09-Jan-21 11:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053
They would probably be like :oop:  if we put them on blast.


[09-Jan-21 11:35 AM] Polk#1596
facts


[09-Jan-21 11:35 AM] Polk#1596
then we will be the ones in general saying

OOP did you really do that? LMASFOFO PLSSSS 😭  we been knew this all along


[09-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
This is what happens when a former resigns:
They think they can get away with anything and act all immature and think they can never get punished. Act like having a former role is a priv that they can keep forever.


[09-Jan-21 11:37 AM] Polk#1596
exactly


[09-Jan-21 11:37 AM] Polk#1596
they should be thankful the role even exist


[09-Jan-21 11:38 AM] Polk#1596
when they go out of their way to cyberbully people on purpose, put bloxton in a bad light and give the other good formers a bad image


[09-Jan-21 11:38 AM] Polk#1596
they should be able to understand that its gonna disappear pretty damn fast


[09-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
I legit wouldn’t even care if we deleted the former mr role altogether at this point


[09-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
But then I feel bad for the people that actually do nothing


[09-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
But sadly, there is very few that are actually peaceful formers


[09-Jan-21 11:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828
same it causes a lot of problems


[09-Jan-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
If we deleted it it wouldn’t look good for us.


[09-Jan-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
It would cause a lot more problems but at the same time I don’t care anymore at this point

The fact they're literally oblivious to their actions is quite concerning


[09-Jan-21 11:42 AM] xM_inn#2821
Out of all former MRs, there is only a few of them who actually deserve to be recognised for their hard work put into the group


[09-Jan-21 11:43 AM] Polk#1596
its sad but we just gotta keep removing the roles until eventually only the good people that actually deserve it and can PRESERVE it will have it


[09-Jan-21 11:43 AM] xM_inn#2821
Others have all gone toxic or turned on bad terms with us


[09-Jan-21 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
The fact they think I removed every single of their former roles on my own with no other HR opinion and tell me to “calm down”


[09-Jan-21 11:43 AM] Polk#1596
yet another example of them thinking they know everything


[09-Jan-21 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
And then attack me over it


[09-Jan-21 11:43 AM] KjRBLX#2053
They're probably typing up a google doc right now 🙄


[09-Jan-21 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
They think I’m going to make a whole announcement over it


[09-Jan-21 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
Like no


[09-Jan-21 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
And they wonder why we will never give them a former MR channel :thonking:


[09-Jan-21 11:45 AM] Polk#1596
we dont have time to write up fully detailed reports as to why we removed their roles when they clearly know the reason themself


[09-Jan-21 11:45 AM] Polk#1596
they even have the urge and saltiness to dm us saying "so why did my former role get removeddd pls"


[09-Jan-21 11:45 AM] Polk#1596
just says a lot about them


[09-Jan-21 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
Yep


[09-Jan-21 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
I will always view former MRs as toxic


[09-Jan-21 11:48 AM] stacey#1000

man do these formers even understand how stupid they are being rn


[09-Jan-21 11:56 AM] stacey#1000
They literally all made this worse themselves and make a huge deal over a child accidentally calling rylee “she” all the time and use that as their excuse to attack crown and cause even more drama

yes i did


[09-Jan-21 11:58 AM] stacey#1000
That it’s not a straight ban anymore


[09-Jan-21 11:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
emma just doesnt read the rules everyday


[09-Jan-21 11:59 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And Ayesha tagged me in general discussion with "WRONG" and a picture.


[09-Jan-21 11:59 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I saw the picture


[09-Jan-21 12:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it was her going against my word telling Crown they were not getting a promotion


[09-Jan-21 12:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I clicked on it read, clicked off and i think she deleted it


[09-Jan-21 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
Legit their argument is that crown is a troller and started all this when they themselves literally started all of it.


[09-Jan-21 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
If they knew she was a troller they shouldn’t have engaged in causing drama and fake promoting her


[09-Jan-21 12:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
they should of just report it. 🙂


[09-Jan-21 12:03 PM] stacey#1000

he expected crown to just see that


[09-Jan-21 12:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
You can't expect someone to see just by putting it in gd. if you really wanna acknowledge it to them..u need to ping them


[09-Jan-21 12:08 PM] stacey#1000

I said you can’t get in trouble for it cause crown said it was accident

One lr who has been here a month and got attacked for no reason over 4 formers who should very well know better how to act and act immature to get their roles taken themselves and look for someone else to blame.


[09-Jan-21 12:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
thats like saying the cops will arrest a young person for robbing a bank but not a 71 year old for doing the same crime because the old man has been in the world longer


[09-Jan-21 12:12 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[09-Jan-21 12:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053

I think I got the formers to finally quit being annoying. I told them crown was punished and removed from the server and I’m not going to punish when they already were punished. An MR kicked them and warned them so. Hopefully they stop now.

@High Rank I have added a bunch of promotion opinions to the board after looking at the senior board and managers suggestions as well. You can claim some to promote on the cards I have not joined, or if you know something about a user you can comment on it. All of them are from the MRs opinions so I just sent them over.


[11-Jan-21 10:25 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[11-Jan-21 04:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
When it ends mid-week or towards end, I don’t penalize them for it if they’re unable to reach the requirements for the week. I’ll make an announcement to seniors about that though since that’s a good question he had @courtney

I would claim but idk most of them so I’ll wait till I host more

@lyss when u said immaturity do u mean immaturity at the hotel and at sessions?

do we still think iigraycatii is meme


[12-Jan-21 05:26 PM] courtney#5125
id find it really hard to believe if she is, shes remained very active for months on end. that seems like too much effort and time wasted if she were to just want the rank to abuse or troll or smthg


[12-Jan-21 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
I dont think she is meme


[12-Jan-21 05:27 PM] ethan;#0003
like 6 or 7 months ago we got a report it was


[12-Jan-21 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
i just think she was good friends wiht her


[12-Jan-21 05:27 PM] ethan;#0003
that meme "quit" roblox the same time


[12-Jan-21 05:27 PM] ethan;#0003
but we have had no proof since


[12-Jan-21 05:27 PM] katie#0200
I don’t think we should keep holding her back without solid evidence


[12-Jan-21 05:28 PM] courtney#5125
i think the least we could determine is that theyre friends, but thats not smthg to hold her back for


[12-Jan-21 05:29 PM] ethan;#0003
if she is meme, she dedicated like 10 months....


[12-Jan-21 05:29 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 05:29 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 05:31 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe we question him


[12-Jan-21 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
we really dont have evidence against him tho

[12-Jan-21 05:33 PM] ethan;#0003
WHYY


[12-Jan-21 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
I got evidence of him


[12-Jan-21 05:34 PM] courtney#5125
so its hard to hold ppl back for promotions purely based on someone who was terminated for doxxing, cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and grabbing ips


[12-Jan-21 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[12-Jan-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
those CB's arent even active ones anymore

ok


[12-Jan-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
im just kinda ify


[12-Jan-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
like would we ever let rack appeal?


[12-Jan-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
like that ify


[12-Jan-21 05:35 PM] lyss#0709
i agree with stacey, just bc it was a while ago doesnt mean he's the perfect person now


[12-Jan-21 05:35 PM] ethan;#0003
i see that he has changed


[12-Jan-21 05:35 PM] ethan;#0003
he used to be very immature


[12-Jan-21 05:35 PM] ethan;#0003
and he acts a lot more professional now


[12-Jan-21 05:35 PM] courtney#5125
im kinda eh on him


[12-Jan-21 05:36 PM] courtney#5125
wasnt he suspected/punished for ip grabbing venom or smthg


[12-Jan-21 05:36 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think so they are like bff's


[12-Jan-21 05:36 PM] courtney#5125
he was defo involved but idr


[12-Jan-21 05:37 PM] courtney#5125
ya which is why he had information on venom, they were close friends


[12-Jan-21 05:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok why don’t we look at it this way, we’re not promoting poky right cause of what Kylie claimed. but.. if we promote poky and he does end up being a leaker, then we finally can get rid of him. at this point he’s a good manager, and we have suspicions of him but no evidence. idk I wouldn’t be TOTALLY against him getting promoted. if he leaks that’s on him, he’ll get the consequences, and that’s one less person to worry about.


[12-Jan-21 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
oh i see the vedom thing


[12-Jan-21 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
it wasnt ip


[12-Jan-21 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
dqaf found his info on his youtube channel


[12-Jan-21 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
it was dqaf the cb


[12-Jan-21 05:38 PM] Fraux#7971
that make a ton of sense bloo


[12-Jan-21 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
If we were to promote let's not do it rn when everyone getting promoted so we 100% know


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Like in 2 weeks but we cannot promote anyone else!


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
eh...I guess if whala gets promoted keep an eye on him


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh and guys


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
cause I dont trust him


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Make sure u get all ur promos in as I restrict promos near the awards so like in 30 days restrictions start


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] Fraux#7971
why does whala sound so familar


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i agree with bloo, poky would make a great manager. if he leaks then at least we won't have to worry about it anymore


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] Fraux#7971
did he do something forever ago


[12-Jan-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000

Jess was promoted same time as maya


[12-Jan-21 05:57 PM] lyss#0709
maya's nice but i feel like she's way too scared to get her opinion out there


[12-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
Both are active


[12-Jan-21 05:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Jess is the most active senior


[12-Jan-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
I’m saying if we had a vote for 2 shifts


[12-Jan-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000

Here is next discussion


[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
drizzle has been a senior since august too, and she’s pretty active. Just a bit longer than Jess so if we were to have a vote I would probably consider her too


[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] courtney#5125
ya! ^


[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Y’all r forgetting about Quwanters 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 he’s active!


[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] lyss#0709
id vote for jess next but i think all of the seniors still need a bit more time


[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] stacey#1000
How long Eric been senior


[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[12-Jan-21 06:00 PM] courtney#5125

[12-Jan-21 06:01 PM] lyss#0709

[12-Jan-21 06:01 PM] courtney#5125

[12-Jan-21 06:01 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 06:01 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 06:01 PM] courtney#5125

[12-Jan-21 06:01 PM] bonnie591#0591

Explain Stacey


[12-Jan-21 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
There are some people that just i feel like are too new and arent as into the community


[12-Jan-21 06:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’d say our top choices are Drizzle, Jess and Maya. Maybe Maddy


[12-Jan-21 06:02 PM] lyss#0709
ig if that was a huge factor i should be fired 👋


[12-Jan-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Cuz i can say the same thing for Australia but x100 more needed


[12-Jan-21 06:02 PM] courtney#5125

[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] courtney#5125
shes been a senior since the very beginning of august


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
I would only consider Jess and maya


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] lyss#0709

[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] ethan;#0003
madi i dont think she will ever be shift


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] stacey#1000
That’s it


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] lyss#0709
same


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] courtney#5125
longer than jess and maya


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] ethan;#0003
she has been suspended like 3 times


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Drizzle has been a shift longer than Jess and maya


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] lyss#0709
madi's basically imag except shes been suspended more


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So it would be the same for Jess and Maya too then


[12-Jan-21 06:03 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Drizzles a shift?

are we talking a shift vote like in the next few weeks or like a in a couple months


[12-Jan-21 06:04 PM] cory!#8287
yeah it just sucks that madi has been in so much trouble cause she'd be so useful 😭


[12-Jan-21 06:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Courtney like Emma said u were vocal and Anna wasn't when we were discussing the shift vote back then. Like we only had one vote each and we decided to cancel it in the end cuz it was so toxic. Then like Emma got fired and we hired 2 new hrs u and Anna and now we have a hr team that isn't toxic!


[12-Jan-21 06:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but tbh I know the shift vote isn’t rn BUT do we really need more Hrs


[12-Jan-21 06:04 PM] courtney#5125
so basically


[12-Jan-21 06:04 PM] lyss#0709
i didnt really think we were in need of more hrs yet


[12-Jan-21 06:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Just cuz Anna wasn't as vocal as courtney doesn't mean there is a massive difference! U are both amazing hrs


[12-Jan-21 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
We are discussing for a future vote


[12-Jan-21 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
No new hr for ages


[12-Jan-21 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591

[12-Jan-21 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
Let’s honestly give him a chance


[12-Jan-21 06:52 PM] courtney#5125
hes not bst so the leaker couldnt have been him


[12-Jan-21 06:53 PM] courtney#5125
and hes been one of the most active and consistent heads we have


[12-Jan-21 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! add a card for him


[12-Jan-21 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
If he gets 5 votes


[12-Jan-21 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
You can promote him


[12-Jan-21 06:53 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Jan-21 06:55 PM] cory!#8287

[12-Jan-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
Do you think he was really a CB?


[12-Jan-21 06:56 PM] cory!#8287
and if something from management gets leaked we will know who it is


[12-Jan-21 06:57 PM] courtney#5125
i dont think he was actually a cb, he just seemed to be friends with a couple of them a few months ago

[12-Jan-21 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I knew he’d get upset with senior promos that were not him


[12-Jan-21 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
Little did he know it would’ve been him if he didn’t hint

if i knew she was friends with like 2 of the most toxic formers i wouldnt have voted


[13-Jan-21 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
just becus they are friends on discord doesnt mean they are close friends


[13-Jan-21 03:32 PM] ethan;#0003
and we cant not let someone get promoted just because they are friends with someone on discord


[13-Jan-21 03:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
well, I know that.


[13-Jan-21 03:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053

Oh that was just a suggested time. Dw tho


[13-Jan-21 04:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If you're wonder why Vicky isn't promoted yet. I do the actual ranking until I went over the rules with them. Right now, she is busy. I told her to contact me when she gets time.


[13-Jan-21 04:44 PM] courtney#5125
as long as they werent gone for like several months, its not fair to just make them basically start over. if they worked for a few months, left, and came back a few days later as the same rank, they should still have a good chance of getting promoted after their prior hard work


[13-Jan-21 04:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya


[13-Jan-21 04:44 PM] anna#0004
@stacey ya i dont see why it would be an issue because its not like they lose all their knowledge as soon as they leave


[13-Jan-21 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
Dvesing wasn’t gone too long and he’s also been back longer then 2 weeks as well so


[13-Jan-21 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
His promotion will stand


[13-Jan-21 04:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah I don’t mind


[13-Jan-21 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
So I don’t need to undo his promotion good


[13-Jan-21 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
I mean too late now he’s ranked and knows the rules


[13-Jan-21 04:49 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i dont mind as long as he has prior experience like you said he did


[13-Jan-21 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
Alright I’ll announce to seniors so they know when recommending people

@High Rank gonna promote Tasiahhh_1 tomorrow. If u see her at ur session please notify me immediately before the start time so me and Lee can hop to the session (interview preferably) on alts and get interviewed/trained by her. We will need the host to give us mod though so we can act like they are being ranked by alts.

my only worry is if we share it with heads


[14-Jan-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
they will leak it


[14-Jan-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
cause there is still a head thats leaking


[14-Jan-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
its probably aidan


[14-Jan-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000

[14-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
is it will get leaked by heads


[14-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
there is still one actively leaking


[14-Jan-21 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
I dont trust the heads rn


[14-Jan-21 05:17 PM] anna#0004

the fact he compared Lrs to formers 😭


[14-Jan-21 07:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like imagine a alliance saw a LR acting up and a former acting up.


[14-Jan-21 07:25 PM] cory!#8287
ngl some lrs are better behaved then some formers


[14-Jan-21 07:26 PM] lyss#0709
if ayesha, lily, libby, annie, and ryley didnt have people to trash talk, their gcs would be LONG dead

mhm


[14-Jan-21 07:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If I was an alliance, I would see two different things. 
Like a LR, I would be like oh, just a troller who got a rank. 
then a MR, I would just be like oh, they hired you to be mr with that attitude?

That was back in September before she was even an MR


[15-Jan-21 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
If it’s like 3 months old I don’t really find it valid.


[15-Jan-21 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
It’s been 4 months


[15-Jan-21 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
That was when she was an LR


[15-Jan-21 12:11 PM] anna#0004
yeah i was wondering about the date tbh, im not sure why people decide to report things late but yeah its true it was a while ago anyway


[15-Jan-21 12:11 PM] anna#0004
ill give u my vote


[15-Jan-21 12:11 PM] stacey#1000
She sent me stuff too back again there is nothing valid


[15-Jan-21 12:11 PM] stacey#1000
Also we are sus of Libby Rn


[15-Jan-21 12:12 PM] stacey#1000
She’s like bffs with the people we just banned and could be having something against hailey, using old evidence to try to stop her from getting management.


[15-Jan-21 12:12 PM] stacey#1000
Hailey has improved a lot since becoming an MR.


[15-Jan-21 12:12 PM] anna#0004
shes friends with ayesha, annie and those guys?


[15-Jan-21 12:13 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[15-Jan-21 12:13 PM] stacey#1000
She is sus

[15-Jan-21 12:14 PM] stacey#1000
So my guess is she is trying to stop her from getting promoted with old proof


[15-Jan-21 12:14 PM] anna#0004
oh im not sure why she re sent that LOL


[15-Jan-21 12:14 PM] anna#0004
but yeah probably just doesnt want her to get promo


[15-Jan-21 12:14 PM] anna#0004
for whatever reason

[15-Jan-21 12:14 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I told her that


[15-Jan-21 12:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
lol


[15-Jan-21 12:15 PM] stacey#1000
And then I ignored it because it’s old proof of before she was even an MR


[15-Jan-21 12:15 PM] stacey#1000
like she’s improved majorly since becoming an MR and has matured


[15-Jan-21 12:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
She gets promoted. Libby: 👁️ 👄 👁️


[15-Jan-21 12:15 PM] stacey#1000
she said that 2 months before she was even an MR


[15-Jan-21 12:16 PM] anna#0004
when hailey gets promoted, best believe libby will be in our dms w that proof again


[15-Jan-21 12:16 PM] stacey#1000
If anything this proof just shows how much she has improved because she’s done nothing like that since being on the MR team. Libby is helping her!


[15-Jan-21 12:16 PM] anna#0004
LOL yes


[15-Jan-21 12:17 PM] stacey#1000
Oh ya no doubt when I promote her Libby will show up in my DMs and be like  “I thought you said you keep that in mind for promotions?”


[15-Jan-21 12:18 PM] anna#0004
LOL literally


[15-Jan-21 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
Libby has just held herself back majorly for her chance at management with the friend group she chose and the way she acts towards others.


[15-Jan-21 12:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
wait..


[15-Jan-21 12:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
when is that meeting?


[15-Jan-21 12:19 PM] stacey#1000

[16-Jan-21 01:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I wonder if she realizes it


[16-Jan-21 01:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
go to rules and info tell me if theres any rules that should be edited or whatever


[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
16. Staff members may not request the talkative role when they currently have a staff role.


[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats the only rule we should like remove


[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
because we dont do talkative tickets and staff cant see access pending


[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:06 PM] cory!#8287
has anyone ever warned someone for rule 13


[16-Jan-21 01:07 PM] cory!#8287
13. Using inspect element, editing, or sending any fake evidence will result in your demotion and blacklist from Bloxton Hotels.


[16-Jan-21 01:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
probs banned no warn


[16-Jan-21 01:07 PM] cory!#8287
o yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
its so funny when they do


[16-Jan-21 01:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
they dont do it for me anymore but


[16-Jan-21 01:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
it was everyday at one point and like


[16-Jan-21 01:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
ive probably had 100+ dms of that overtime and every request was false


[16-Jan-21 01:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don’t think that’s a bad idea

[16-Jan-21 01:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
also someone mentioned there being 108 or something suggestions, we gonna go over every single one? :flushed3:


[16-Jan-21 01:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
btw for the rule 2 violation thing. should we appeal every single ban for rule 2 or should we auto appeal if they try to appeal. also if we should unban every single one who wants to help at the end


[16-Jan-21 01:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
and if its not possible or stupid we'll just auto archive


[16-Jan-21 01:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
True true


[16-Jan-21 01:12 PM] cory!#8287

[16-Jan-21 01:13 PM] cory!#8287
to revoke every ban


[16-Jan-21 01:13 PM] cory!#8287
for that reason


[16-Jan-21 01:13 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
how about we changed it to rank locks which also gives us more options as we can like say imag is rank locked to senior. this user is rank locked to lr due to previous leaking etc


[16-Jan-21 01:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could one time try it see if leaking happens but not rn we'll try poky first


[16-Jan-21 01:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
y'all agreed?


[16-Jan-21 01:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if someone from management team leaks in first month of him being promoted then we will def know it’s him or something


[16-Jan-21 01:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I agree


[16-Jan-21 01:17 PM] anna#0004
yaaa


[16-Jan-21 01:17 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
ya


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yup


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yes


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If they re-train


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
then uh


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
maybe not


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think like a 2 week period if they retrain as theres not really a difference between head ranks


[16-Jan-21 01:18 PM] katie#0200
they should at least wait a bit because they need to get used to their new rank


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
2 weeks is enough


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
i was active for 2 weeks of lr


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
got head


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah that’s cause the group was smaller back then noob


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] katie#0200
ya but bonnie that was 2016 :5CatStare:


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] cory!#8287
Rule #16. If you're a former MR or HR and decide to cause misconduct within the Discord server, you will risk your former role getting revoked for a certain period of time.


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] cory!#8287
is that good


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
thanks cory


[16-Jan-21 01:19 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:20 PM] cory!#8287
2 weeks seems fine


[16-Jan-21 01:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
2 weeks is fine, as long as they’re working and showing dedication


[16-Jan-21 01:20 PM] cory!#8287

[16-Jan-21 01:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Ok


[16-Jan-21 01:23 PM] cory!#8287
i cant find him in the discord server


[16-Jan-21 01:23 PM] emily#4444
2ky_le changed his username to VedomsEnemy


[16-Jan-21 01:23 PM] cory!#8287
ohhh


[16-Jan-21 01:23 PM] cory!#8287
makes sense


[16-Jan-21 01:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok next thing i want to bring up. should we make temporary blacklists a thing as rn all blacklists have to be permanent


[16-Jan-21 01:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
also changed the name from permanently denied to blacklists?!


[16-Jan-21 01:24 PM] cory!#8287
havent we appealed blacklists before tho


[16-Jan-21 01:25 PM] cory!#8287
or does it depend which person we appeal


[16-Jan-21 01:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm


[16-Jan-21 01:25 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure ill add list limits


[16-Jan-21 01:27 PM] cory!#8287
yeahh also what about like the people that like bypass in applications


[16-Jan-21 01:27 PM] cory!#8287
cause thats probably most of the cards


[16-Jan-21 01:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah id have to ask him if we could link like blacklists to the application center


[16-Jan-21 01:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
should we start going over suggestions now


[16-Jan-21 01:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[16-Jan-21 01:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

@xM_inn job


[16-Jan-21 01:30 PM] katie#0200
lots of groups do employees of the month tho so idk


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Minn kinda did that this summer DIDNT he


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
didnt*


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
last*


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] cory!#8287
yeah min did a may madness event


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
in like May


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] cory!#8287
which is kinda


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] cory!#8287
a summer event


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
or in august I think we did one


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
employee of the month might actually be fun tbh but idk might cause drama


[16-Jan-21 01:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I remember I participated in something like thag


[16-Jan-21 01:32 PM] cory!#8287
yeah 100% can see that happening


[16-Jan-21 01:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Employee of the month would def cause drama. If the group was smaller I feel like it could be good tbh but we’re so big and people will def complain


[16-Jan-21 01:32 PM] katie#0200
its worked in other groups but it may be cool to try, idk how we'd determine the winners tho


[16-Jan-21 01:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
employee of the week!


[16-Jan-21 01:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[16-Jan-21 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
but wouldnt lr be hard


[16-Jan-21 01:33 PM] cory!#8287
lr would be


[16-Jan-21 01:33 PM] cory!#8287
confusing


[16-Jan-21 01:33 PM] cory!#8287
but mr and hr could work


[16-Jan-21 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
id love to announce that!


[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Mr would work since it’s way smaller but lr no no no


[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
anyway


[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] katie#0200
maybe just mr and hr yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
omg hr of the month

[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
We did?


[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
omg i should bring that back


[16-Jan-21 01:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OH

hi lyss


[16-Jan-21 01:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
we are a smaller hr team and the same person can easily do most sessions. eventually we will give it to people who dont do so much and eh itjust wont work but maybe hr of the month


[16-Jan-21 01:35 PM] cory!#8287
can verified see rules and info


[16-Jan-21 01:35 PM] cory!#8287
i think they can


[16-Jan-21 01:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes


[16-Jan-21 01:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Bman


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] katie#0200
omg i remember that


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
problem with hr and lr of the week is hr team is so small but lr is too big


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
mr is a good size but


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
we must think hard on who deserves it most or whatever


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
wait ik


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] cory!#8287
if we were to do it how would we like... do it tho?


[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:36 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] cory!#8287
cause heads dont log shifts


[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
imagine if we made heads log


[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] cory!#8287
i can already see some faking activity by doing that


[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
but cant managements do that


[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] lyss#0709
alright


[16-Jan-21 01:37 PM] cory!#8287
yeah but managers are more trusted then heads


[16-Jan-21 01:38 PM] cory!#8287
in my opinion at least


[16-Jan-21 01:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we catch them lying then consequence


[16-Jan-21 01:38 PM] lyss#0709
okok


[16-Jan-21 01:38 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[16-Jan-21 01:38 PM] katie#0200

[16-Jan-21 01:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
4 hrs nominated


[16-Jan-21 01:41 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:42 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:42 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we add most hard working as just one award tho it will probs do last year


[16-Jan-21 01:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
where its mainly hrs cuz people simp


[16-Jan-21 01:43 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:43 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 01:44 PM] bonnie591#0591

“I feel that instead of asking for servers in an HR's DMs, it would possibly be better to have a channel called #senior-discussion or something in our Discord where we reserve servers, so it's clearer who has which servers and so that it makes it more fair.”

[16-Jan-21 02:05 PM] katie#0200
that would make ints take twice as long

[16-Jan-21 02:05 PM] lyss#0709
once seniors know what server number they have, its not that difficult to find the server


[16-Jan-21 02:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
maybe a senior?


[16-Jan-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
we shouldnt do them like they pass the first one, it just looks like we are trying to get rid of people for petty reasons

[16-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
and just make people wait


[16-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
we used to do 1 at a time back in the day and we had full servers, its not that hard


[16-Jan-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 02:08 PM] ethan;#0003
and ik they will all get more then 4


[16-Jan-21 02:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
just do 4 at a time


[16-Jan-21 02:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
u can make interviewees wait and make the session longer


[16-Jan-21 02:08 PM] katie#0200
even tho its not hard i dont think many mrs would want to attend interviews if they had to be there for twice as long

“[DISCORD SUGGESTION] | My suggestion is to allow Management+ to delete any hinter reports which are completely invalid. This will allow HRs to check the ones which could potentially be valid. What I mean by invalid hinter reports are reports which involve people hinting to help at trainings, these just get denied anyways so we might as well be allowed to delete them to speed up the HR checking process of them all. The rest of the hinter reports should then be left for HRs to decide if they hint or not, but anyone who reports people who hint at trainings should have their message deleted from the channel by a Manager+.”

do you think that’s needed


[16-Jan-21 02:22 PM] katie#0200
eh i dont think thats needed its sometimes difficult to figure out what their timezone is


[16-Jan-21 02:22 PM] lyss#0709
eh i think if the mr suggesting them knows their timezone, they can add it, but it shouldn't be required


[16-Jan-21 02:22 PM] katie#0200
but itd be helpful if they mentiond it if they knew

oh also i think min mentioned this a few months ago, but what do you guys think about having like a way of tracking what mrs do rather than looking in here, for example we'd make a trello board with a card for each mr and note down stuff like warnings, suspensions, incidents theyre involved in, etc


[16-Jan-21 02:26 PM] cory!#8287
I brought this up a couple days ago in hr announcements and there were some concerns of it getting leaked, but what do y’all think of adding an interview basics and updated copied interview answers for MRs since we have a ton of new MRs now


[16-Jan-21 02:26 PM] lyss#0709
i like that idea katie


[16-Jan-21 02:27 PM] anna#0004
ya that seems good


[16-Jan-21 02:27 PM] cory!#8287
and the older ones are outdated


[16-Jan-21 02:27 PM] cory!#8287
doesn’t have to be now but maybe in the future


[16-Jan-21 02:27 PM] lyss#0709

[16-Jan-21 02:28 PM] katie#0200
yeah thats an option, it may end up making the board laggier since we have like idk 100+ mrs


[16-Jan-21 02:28 PM] cory!#8287

[16-Jan-21 02:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

“[Rules & Regulations Suggestion] After thinking about this for some time, I have decided to suggest that "Inappropriate behaviour" should be classed as a major offense. Firstly, we've lowered our grammar standards so much because we know there are younger people located in the group now, so with a younger audience, we should also make inappropriate behaviour a major offense as it's not pleasant to see it occur at the hotel. Inappropriate behaviour is just not an acceptable thing with these younger people around and so it should be an immediate ban (major offense) rather than 1 warning to prevent any form of immaturity present around the hotel atmosphere.”


[16-Jan-21 02:34 PM] cory!#8287
what about this one


[16-Jan-21 02:34 PM] cory!#8287

[16-Jan-21 03:07 PM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jan-21 03:11 PM] emily#4444
i agree but i dont see why they need huge paragraphs when the majority of things are the same for every session


[16-Jan-21 03:12 PM] lyss#0709
idk why some seniors are so against it


[16-Jan-21 03:12 PM] lyss#0709

[16-Jan-21 03:15 PM] katie#0200
eh idk i dont think thats necessary, i think the seniors are capable enough of shortening their pms on their own - we dont rlly have strict rules on how their pms should be anyways

[17-Jan-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
@anna all this proof all of a sudden shows up when she’s promoted. Again it was from September 2 months before she was even an MR and she’s done nothing like that since becoming an MR and she has improved. I’ve seen no recent evidence. Annoying af when people show old evidence and show after they are promoted to think it will have any affect.


[17-Jan-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
Voted @ethan;


[17-Jan-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
Tell them that


[17-Jan-21 04:56 PM] stacey#1000
It is kinda concerning she said that though-


[17-Jan-21 04:56 PM] anna#0004
mhmm thats what i told libby and ive said if theres **current** proof then yeah send it but things from like september aren't going to affect anything reallyy


[17-Jan-21 04:56 PM] stacey#1000
I predicted this would happen and it’s kind of funny


[17-Jan-21 04:56 PM] stacey#1000
More proof that has no affect.


[17-Jan-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
I still see hailey has improved matured  majorly with that proof. Legit she’s done nothing that I’m aware of recently and that’s why she’s a manager now


[17-Jan-21 04:59 PM] anna#0004
yeah


[17-Jan-21 04:59 PM] anna#0004
@stacey she just sent this

[17-Jan-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[17-Jan-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
But either way the stuff from December doesn’t seem really major either


[17-Jan-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
Like the one part idk why that’s part of the report


[17-Jan-21 05:06 PM] anna#0004
yeah its not major, i feel like shes just trying to find anything tbh

[17-Jan-21 05:07 PM] lyss#0709
dont they get into a ton of drama in gd


[17-Jan-21 05:07 PM] lyss#0709
they always side with toxic formers


[17-Jan-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Jan-21 05:08 PM] cory!#8287
no


[17-Jan-21 05:08 PM] lyss#0709
i see mansion but they tend to be immature


[17-Jan-21 05:09 PM] cory!#8287
maybe its timezone differences idk


[17-Jan-21 05:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
I see mansion all the time in the discord server


[17-Jan-21 05:09 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i usually see him in the discord but not any bloxton games


[17-Jan-21 05:09 PM] lyss#0709
he spends much more time in general discussion than he does in game


[17-Jan-21 05:11 PM] anna#0004
@stacey this isnt rlly anything major but i think libby is offended by it, anyway its the same video just with haileys tag

It’s not anything major we can fire her for


[17-Jan-21 05:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
We need a form called the post promotion report centre that we'll never look at


[17-Jan-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
Just tell them her promotion stands and not to report things late. That was also still a month ago and I still consider it old evidence.


[17-Jan-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
Stuff from like 1 month+ is old evidence to me.


[17-Jan-21 05:13 PM] anna#0004
yuppp


[17-Jan-21 05:13 PM] anna#0004
will do


[17-Jan-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
Even if it’s like 2 weeks+. Like just don’t report stuff late people that do annoy me so much oml


[17-Jan-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
I called it would happen though


[17-Jan-21 05:15 PM] anna#0004
was honestly waiting for libbys dm i knew she would bring it up again


[17-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
Yep

[17-Jan-21 05:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They just expect her promotion to be revoked?


[17-Jan-21 05:54 PM] KjRBLX#2053
anyone what could possibly cause this?

[18-Jan-21 12:01 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
once you get trainee rank u gotta attend a training. for now if you really want to go shift you have to shadow an aide+


[18-Jan-21 12:01 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so you go in the server and ask if anyone is taking shadows


[18-Jan-21 12:01 AM] ethan;#0003
when is the next training


[18-Jan-21 12:01 AM] ethan;#0003

[18-Jan-21 12:01 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

they are a little late


[18-Jan-21 02:53 AM] KjRBLX#2053
You get on the boat. Go to the main place. Do what the nurses say or get beat with a stick 😭 Try to get holy water so u don’t turn into a spider I guess (twitching and blurs signal progression of turning) EAT. They usually serve the food then start the countdown..so try to grab your food and run to a room ig cuz that’s what I do.. I eat the food in the dorm room because if u wait too long, people will be done locked u out with like 15 seconds still on the clock. Ive never been to a server where they’ve never ate before they started the countdown.


[18-Jan-21 02:54 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And try to get holy water.


[18-Jan-21 02:54 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And don’t get stuck in a room with someone that’s about to turn


[18-Jan-21 02:55 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Me: get holy water, get food, run to a room.


[18-Jan-21 02:58 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I wonder if there’s a discord server...


[18-Jan-21 03:01 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I wouldn’t ask Nurses for help to get away from spiders..I’ve heard that bloo lead someone to a spider

I already announced to managers about this


[18-Jan-21 02:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah they have ignored it now


[18-Jan-21 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
If you want to re-announce it go ahead but I already did befor3


[18-Jan-21 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
Before*


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
i will but like i dont want kids getting banned for spamming "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" 15 times or whatever as yes its major spam but they dont know any better, a fire is understandable but not a ban


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
Just copy and paste that announcement again


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
so we need to include intent this time


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
And tag people again to not ignore it


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
but do u agree about chatlog proof too


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
like


[18-Jan-21 02:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
it doesnt really prove anything


[18-Jan-21 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
Sure


[18-Jan-21 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
I’m just saying if you don’t want to make an entire new announcement you can go ahead and copy and paste some stuff from the one I did in September


[18-Jan-21 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
also new rule too, they cant add ban requests to the training center for major spamming staff, thats now up to the hrs to determine


[18-Jan-21 02:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
no im original! :D


[18-Jan-21 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
Ok have fun. I’m too lazy to make a new announcement since I announced it before


[18-Jan-21 02:46 PM] lyss#0709
yeah the chatlogs proof bothers me bc ppl could easily have said a paragraph 30 minutes apart 4 times each, and chatlogs makes it look like it was intentional and all at once


[18-Jan-21 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
i have the motivation because i dont like what ive seen from the managers recently


[18-Jan-21 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes lys


[18-Jan-21 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 oh ya can you also announce about what you can mute people for in the discord I forgot


[18-Jan-21 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
I’m too lazy to do announcements rn


[18-Jan-21 02:47 PM] lyss#0709
and when mrs will search the word that the person spammed in chatlogs instead of their username just to make it seem like they spammed 5 paragraphs in a row when they really didnt


[18-Jan-21 02:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure stacey


[18-Jan-21 02:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
ill do announcement tomorrow tho cuz i have to go soon


[18-Jan-21 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 ok but can you get rid of the thing for awaiting trainees so they cannot talk without talkative role anymore if it’s still like that


[18-Jan-21 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
The thing Ethan announced


[18-Jan-21 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
Idk if it was changed


[18-Jan-21 02:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[18-Jan-21 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
Ty


[18-Jan-21 02:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
trainee updated


[18-Jan-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
im gonna


[18-Jan-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
drop a reminder about reading pinned messages


[18-Jan-21 03:06 PM] courtney#5125
yeah it always bugs me when ppl report without including them typing in the username of the player, it can be easily manipulated since they couldve just looked up the word they said and then it looks like spamming


[18-Jan-21 04:21 PM] stacey#1000
@Fraux I’m going to change my sessions if you want to host still


[18-Jan-21 04:24 PM] lyss#0709
should we still ban impersonators at interviews even tho theres no way they can get mod now


[18-Jan-21 04:24 PM] stacey#1000
I still do


[18-Jan-21 04:24 PM] lyss#0709
alrightt


[18-Jan-21 04:42 PM] Fraux#7971
@stacey I’m okay!! I can host the training


[18-Jan-21 04:43 PM] Fraux#7971
I just wouldn’t have been home in time for the interview so I was gonna push them both back an hour but it’s all good now!


[19-Jan-21 07:47 AM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal are u able to make something that doesnt allow trainees with a discord account age under 30 to verify something like the talkative role one but for trainees cus there has been a lot of alts joining the discord who get trainee and mass tag


[19-Jan-21 07:55 AM] lyss#0709
i thought that was already implemented


[19-Jan-21 10:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank its long yes but please give opinions on it https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eaFN_C0LHUvPNJUq8J1qhMNMyXurQggI1kmhSi4XMWE/edit?usp=sharing

[19-Jan-21 10:32 AM] courtney#5125
yes, looks great!


[19-Jan-21 10:54 AM] cory!#8287
looks good


[19-Jan-21 10:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
so


[19-Jan-21 10:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
the heads took it very well


[19-Jan-21 11:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
like 60% of the managements dont really like it but the others can see why we did this and understand


[19-Jan-21 11:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill review this more and maybe decrease the amount of proof you need


[19-Jan-21 11:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
we arent adding chatlog proof back tho


[19-Jan-21 11:03 AM] cory!#8287
what do they not like about it


[19-Jan-21 11:03 AM] cory!#8287
the number of times they need to spam?


[19-Jan-21 11:06 AM] anna#0004
ya i think thats the reason most of them dont like it


[19-Jan-21 11:09 AM] katie#0200
yeah tbh i think 15+ is a little too much - also I think it should be a bit more of a broader range so people don’t argue if it’s major or not it it’s one off


[19-Jan-21 11:11 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Now hold on what if they cant get the 15 because other people are talking in the chat and it gets knocked off the chatbox


[19-Jan-21 11:11 AM] katie#0200
Yeah same with 5 major paragraphs, most of the time they can barely fit 3


[19-Jan-21 11:12 AM] anna#0004
yeah thats true


[19-Jan-21 11:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill look on changes for it yeah yeah


[19-Jan-21 11:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
we'll see how it goes for now tho


[19-Jan-21 11:25 AM] lyss#0709
yeah i agree with being less strict but i think 15 is a bit of a stretch and it might be hard to get proof of 5 paragraphs


[19-Jan-21 11:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
ye


[19-Jan-21 11:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
interesting tho how heads arent really complaining but managements/seniors are


[19-Jan-21 12:07 PM] stacey#1000
Probably because the managers and seniors are the ones that actually review reports to put on the board for us to ban


[19-Jan-21 12:11 PM] lyss#0709
thats true since itll be more difficult for them to review proof now and make sure its valid


[19-Jan-21 01:07 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 can u change it so trainees need to do the talkative think to talk


[19-Jan-21 01:07 PM] ethan;#0003
we did a vote


[19-Jan-21 01:07 PM] ethan;#0003
a day or 2 ago


[19-Jan-21 01:07 PM] ethan;#0003
cus too many people become trainee without the 30 day requirement


[19-Jan-21 01:07 PM] ethan;#0003
and spam the discord server


[19-Jan-21 01:08 PM] bonnie591#0591

theres a way to make dyno auto ban when someone mass mentions but that would trigger the people who decided to ping 30 people in their daily


[20-Jan-21 03:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Doesn't a daily pinger role just sound redundant tho?


[20-Jan-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
its stupid to have but we wouldnt name it that and its just a way to avoid mass pinging

@Bloxton Assist Sassy! Keep talking like that and we gon pull up! 💁‍♂️


[20-Jan-21 03:28 PM] katie#0200
if there’s gonna be a role for it everyone’s going to want it then daily pings will increase


[20-Jan-21 03:28 PM] katie#0200
which is rlly unnecessary


[20-Jan-21 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
I really never liked daily pings


[20-Jan-21 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
Like they are just annoying and unnecessary to me


[20-Jan-21 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
We shouldn’t be giving people a special role for it


[20-Jan-21 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
We could tell people just not to do daily pings at all


[20-Jan-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
And we have also had people complain about it too but that’s just my opinion on it


[20-Jan-21 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 if you want to add mee6 just to give people a role for daily pings I disagree with that bot then. But could be add mee6 and not give people a role for it? Idk


[20-Jan-21 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
What is mee6 bot


[20-Jan-21 04:06 PM] cory!#8287
is c_ayl blacklisted


[20-Jan-21 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Not sure


[20-Jan-21 04:06 PM] cory!#8287
shes not on the perm denied board but i swore she was toxic with mary and meme

[20-Jan-21 04:07 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[20-Jan-21 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! isn’t Mary not allowed to appeal her blacklist


[20-Jan-21 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
I voted no because she did stuff similar to meme and Ava and shouldn’t be allowed to appeal


[20-Jan-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
Thought so @cory!

[20-Jan-21 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
There are some people we just should never let appeal


[20-Jan-21 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
Like meme and Ava


[20-Jan-21 04:40 PM] stacey#1000
Mary was involved in doxing MRs basically showing their faces and making fun of them


[20-Jan-21 04:40 PM] stacey#1000
She also was one to cause a lot of drama in Vcs too.


[20-Jan-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
There are some people we could probably appeal that says no appeals from awhile ago like Patrick. But some people nooooo

has anyone else had ppl dm them saying the reaction for the talkative role isnt showing up even tho they meet the requirements


[20-Jan-21 05:05 PM] lyss#0709
someone dmed me about it and they said their friend is having the same problem too so


[20-Jan-21 05:07 PM] lyss#0709
the reaction isnt showing up for me either so idk what happened


[20-Jan-21 05:10 PM] stacey#1000
I dont see anything at all for talkative role where it was before


[20-Jan-21 05:12 PM] Fraux#7971
i always check age b4 ranking


[20-Jan-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk good idea but my only suggestion is to raise the number of days to 15 or lower


[20-Jan-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
cause ive had people with account age of like 12 or 13

[20-Jan-21 05:13 PM] lyss#0709
yeah agreed with stacey


[20-Jan-21 05:13 PM] anna#0004
so if its below 10 but they're not suspicious then its finee?


[20-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Polk#1596
i will ask bear if he wants to raise it


[20-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Polk#1596
im talking ban ban


[20-Jan-21 05:13 PM] lyss#0709
i think the number should be raised a bit considering its not hard for someone to create an account and let it sit for 10 days


[20-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Polk#1596
bear said this

[20-Jan-21 05:14 PM] lyss#0709
banning or pbanning??


[20-Jan-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
im at interviews rn that starts in 1 minute so do i do this at my int rn?


[20-Jan-21 05:14 PM] Polk#1596
so we wouldnt be violating any roblox tos for removing a potential alt with bad intentions (and in our case, they usually always have bad intentions)


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
pban


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] lyss#0709
oh


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] lyss#0709
thats


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] lyss#0709
intense


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
i dont think they will create an alt


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
can I kick people with low acc age rn at my interviews? @Polk


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
and 150 days later use the alt for good


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
unless you believe differently


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
im at int rn


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
suppose to start now


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
dont do it yet!


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
just do normal


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[20-Jan-21 05:15 PM] Polk#1596
i want a bit more opinions and yeah i'll forward the thing u guys said to bear


[20-Jan-21 05:16 PM] lyss#0709
isnt pbanning a bit harsh?


[20-Jan-21 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk also what about people that have same usernames as MRs


[20-Jan-21 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
or similar


[20-Jan-21 05:16 PM] lyss#0709
they have to appeal a month later solely for having a low account age


[20-Jan-21 05:18 PM] lyss#0709
im not sure that just seems a little bit cruel in my opinion


[20-Jan-21 05:19 PM] Polk#1596
most simple thing i can think of is just


[20-Jan-21 05:19 PM] Polk#1596
have the MR leave and rejoin then ban while theyre gone


[20-Jan-21 05:19 PM] Polk#1596
its a bit of a hassle but i dont think they will use alts to slow down that process


[20-Jan-21 05:19 PM] katie#0200
Wait didn’t we do that before but it was removed bc it broke roblox tos apparently or something


[20-Jan-21 05:19 PM] Polk#1596
i think it was mostly just to get mod


[20-Jan-21 05:20 PM] katie#0200
I cant quite remember


[20-Jan-21 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
@stacey


[20-Jan-21 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
just for clarification i asked bear if he meant serverban or pban since he just said "ban", but i am assuming he meant pban


[20-Jan-21 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
they are not going to make an account


[20-Jan-21 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
1 day old


[20-Jan-21 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
bad intentions


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
then 50 days later have good intentions


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
that seems unlikely


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
if that is the case


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
or if we make a mistake


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
we unpban


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
or they appeal


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
can I pls kick some people with acc age of 0 rn


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
yeah but that was a script


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
bear said


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
one calling me a brat and is clearly here to troll


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
"banning for being a threat to the game is fine"


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
that doesnt violate roblox tos


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] katie#0200
ah ok


[20-Jan-21 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
yes @stacey


[20-Jan-21 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
yep one wants to cuff abuse im banning 3 of them rn


[20-Jan-21 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
all acc age of 0


[20-Jan-21 05:22 PM] Polk#1596
yikes


[20-Jan-21 05:22 PM] Polk#1596
get rid of em


[20-Jan-21 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
im banning them all for low acc age


[20-Jan-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
LOW NE OF THEM THINKS THEY KNOW SENIOR STUFF


[20-Jan-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
ONE*


[20-Jan-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
bruh


[20-Jan-21 05:24 PM] lyss#0709
i feel like server banning them would suffice, especially if they werent actually there to troll and just wanted to make a new account. it doesnt seem very fair if theyre permanently banned for being a threat when that wasnt their intention in the first place


[20-Jan-21 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
I pbanned them


[20-Jan-21 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
3 of them


[20-Jan-21 05:25 PM] Polk#1596
lyss, i feel like you are mostly referring to the 10% of people that actually have no bad intentions


[20-Jan-21 05:25 PM] Polk#1596
its sad but its a risk we're taking


[20-Jan-21 05:25 PM] Polk#1596
for the greater good


[20-Jan-21 05:26 PM] Polk#1596
but keep in mind its only if they are suspicious


[20-Jan-21 05:26 PM] Polk#1596
if you'd like, you can conduct a mini investigation on their profile


[20-Jan-21 05:26 PM] Polk#1596
if they seem alright with an account age of 5


[20-Jan-21 05:26 PM] Polk#1596
thats fine


[20-Jan-21 05:27 PM] lyss#0709
alrightt


[20-Jan-21 05:27 PM] lyss#0709
i can see the benefits in that too


[20-Jan-21 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
so senior stuff might be getting leaked but i think its a random troller that made up stuff he thinks is senior stuff and then spamming it at the hotel


[20-Jan-21 05:30 PM] Polk#1596
thanks for sharing your opinion though, im still double checking with bear if he wants serverban or pban


[20-Jan-21 05:30 PM] Polk#1596
we'll do what he says


[20-Jan-21 05:30 PM] Polk#1596
what is he saying @stacey


[20-Jan-21 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
1 min


[20-Jan-21 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
imag told me it


[20-Jan-21 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
then they spammed it at my interviews


[20-Jan-21 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
so i send what imag sent

[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] lyss#0709
"session announcements"....? where are they getting their information from LOL


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] Polk#1596
what in the world


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] Polk#1596
with the betterdiscord plugin feature


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
yeah i told imag


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] Polk#1596
they can check what roles can access what channels


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] Polk#1596
and im pretty sure they found out seniors can ban


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
not to worry about it cause it looks like random bs rules someone made up assuming stuff about senior+ info


[20-Jan-21 05:34 PM] Polk#1596
and leaking is obvious


[20-Jan-21 05:35 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[20-Jan-21 05:35 PM] Polk#1596
even if the info is correct


[20-Jan-21 05:35 PM] Polk#1596
its not impossible to guess/find out


[20-Jan-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
its just funny cause they spammed it at my int too


[20-Jan-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
after I banned his 2 friends with low acc age


[20-Jan-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
and was typing in to ban him he starts spamming it

[20-Jan-21 05:41 PM] ethan;#0003
every HR needs to send there senior promo guide


[20-Jan-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
no one leaked though lol


[20-Jan-21 05:41 PM] ethan;#0003
oh.


[20-Jan-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jan-21 05:59 PM] Polk#1596
and if it was imag that asked


[20-Jan-21 05:59 PM] Polk#1596

[22-Jan-21 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
and then there is one from him as an MR in sl


[22-Jan-21 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
of something he deleted


[22-Jan-21 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
just was joking around


[22-Jan-21 09:21 PM] ethan;#0003
was he asked to stop by them?


[22-Jan-21 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
galaxy has asked him to stop in DMs if you look at the photos


[22-Jan-21 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
im going to speak to galaxy regarding it


[22-Jan-21 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
im just sending the evidence I got from 2 seniors rn


[22-Jan-21 09:23 PM] cory!#8287
“Abby is stuck”


[22-Jan-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
ik this is from december some of them, but some is him as an MR and this seems really inappropriate to me and more major


[22-Jan-21 09:24 PM] cory!#8287
that’s kinda.. weird


[22-Jan-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
it hasnt been a month since some of it either


[22-Jan-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
its concerning to me


[22-Jan-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
one is him at interviews and trainings


[22-Jan-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
and also on an uno game with people


[22-Jan-21 09:26 PM] cory!#8287
looks like the main people involved are galaxy Libby and abe


[22-Jan-21 09:26 PM] cory!#8287
we could ask them about it


[22-Jan-21 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
idk how 2 seniors got all this instead of us from them


[22-Jan-21 09:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
when was billy even promoted


[22-Jan-21 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
but the seniors reported it to me so


[22-Jan-21 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
im planning to make the gc with the 2 seniors and then ill need to question galaxy and other people involved


[22-Jan-21 09:27 PM] stacey#1000

so if u want to help with this investigation lmk


[22-Jan-21 09:28 PM] cory!#8287
I can ask Abe about it cause it looks like he ships him with libby


[22-Jan-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
he ships galaxy and abby


[22-Jan-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Jan-21 09:28 PM] cory!#8287
ye


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
mk im going to question galaxy


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
and see if he wishes to speak to me regarding it


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
now would anyone like to be in the gc with the seniors with me


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
the 2 that reported it to me


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but it’s like Ethan said some of this is from December. we can’t really do much there. I mean anything after yeah but anything before shouldn’t really be considered in this case


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
the thing is bloo


[22-Jan-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
it hasnt been a full month and this is something that is more major


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
like harassment and really inappropriate behaviour


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] cory!#8287
I can help u stacey


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
if it was more minor i wouldnt care but


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
this is major


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
we cant ignore something major


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
ok cory ty


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] cory!#8287
yeah he’s acting kinda sus with them


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
only thing is, is this didn’t come from Galaxy and them and whoever else it involved.


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
ill make the gc tomorrow


[22-Jan-21 09:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Unless they’re telling seniors


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
galaxy reported it to seniors


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
and then seniors reproted it to me


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but it would of been better to tell us instead


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmm


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
thats why im going to question galaxy


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] cory!#8287
yeah idk why he reported it to seniors


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk either


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
and the seniors more on where they got all the info from


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah just see what they say


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
step 1 is a gc with the seniors and questioning them on where all the evidence is from


[22-Jan-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
dont question anyone else yet


[22-Jan-21 09:32 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! so ill add u to the gc too


[22-Jan-21 09:32 PM] cory!#8287

[22-Jan-21 09:32 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[22-Jan-21 09:32 PM] stacey#1000
if anyone else wants i the gc lmk


[22-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[22-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

(like ban appeals)


[23-Jan-21 02:28 PM] ethan;#0003
cus there are too many channels


[23-Jan-21 02:38 PM] courtney#5125
wait why would we get rid of ban appeals


[23-Jan-21 02:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
He meant the existing part i think


[23-Jan-21 02:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like clean up channels so he’ll notice the channel more

Alright, my friend just told me she was rice, the old CB. She said she didn't want anyone to tell me.


[23-Jan-21 07:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Put me in a real pickle.


[23-Jan-21 07:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Seems real because she was crying.


[23-Jan-21 07:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I told her that I would have to mention this to the HR, because that would look bad on my part if I didn't mention it. Also said that urisco was a CB (uriel). Now she says she gonna switch discord accounts.She's friends with some of the MRs. She doesn't want this to be released because she doesn't wanna end friendships. CBs aren't real anymore soooo. I can't get on roblox to provide a username tho, but like Faith or something.

[23-Jan-21 09:08 PM] cory!#8287
but Kylie idk


[23-Jan-21 09:08 PM] stacey#1000
Kylie shouldn’t be bribing us with proof of leaking.


[23-Jan-21 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
If she really wanted to appeal she would do the right thing.


[23-Jan-21 09:09 PM] emily#4444
kenzi trash talks 24/7


[23-Jan-21 09:09 PM] cory!#8287
o


[23-Jan-21 09:09 PM] cory!#8287
then probably not kenzi then


[23-Jan-21 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
If she showed proof it could maybe increase her chances to appeal but her bribing doesn’t really look good


[23-Jan-21 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
If she was going to show evidence she would


[23-Jan-21 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
But bribing to get appealed.....mhm no that’s not how it works


[23-Jan-21 09:10 PM] lyss#0709
yeah if she was willing to report the leaking first without bringing appealing into it, then like good for her but bribing isnt gonna help


[23-Jan-21 09:12 PM] stacey#1000
Tell her she could maybe have a chance to appeal if she showed improvement and did the right thing but if she was going to report it she would.


[23-Jan-21 09:12 PM] stacey#1000
It could increase her chances I guess


[23-Jan-21 09:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ok


[23-Jan-21 09:12 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[23-Jan-21 09:13 PM] cory!#8287
appealing her for catching a leaker doesn’t make sense in my opinion


[23-Jan-21 09:13 PM] cory!#8287
even tho it helps us


[23-Jan-21 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah same


[23-Jan-21 10:20 PM] lyss#0709
i put up a card for angela in promotion opinions a few hours ago if any of yall could vote or explain why ur not voting! https://trello.com/c/BAZWCSpB/39053-angelaiscoldd-head-receptionist


[23-Jan-21 10:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
how soon would she be able to appeal


[23-Jan-21 10:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
shes asking


[23-Jan-21 10:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
me


[23-Jan-21 10:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i said possibly we'd let her


[23-Jan-21 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[23-Jan-21 10:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[24-Jan-21 04:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it’s funny you mention that cause I noticed it last night when doing my interviews @cory!


[24-Jan-21 04:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but honestly didn’t think much of it


[24-Jan-21 04:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Most of the Mrs had gone back to the offices and I noticed there was a row where people weren’t checked because most of the mrs went towards the back rows.


[24-Jan-21 04:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
either I don't understand or I just haven't seen it


[24-Jan-21 04:26 PM] cory!#8287
yeahh ive seen it as well but when like 2 seniors brought it up to me it caught my attention a little


[24-Jan-21 04:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah, if that’s becoming a problem then it wouldn’t hurt to announce one if you wanna come up with something @cory!


[24-Jan-21 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
Feel free


[24-Jan-21 04:28 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[24-Jan-21 06:47 PM] ethan;#0003
ofc she leaked she is like kylies best friend


[24-Jan-21 06:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
😐


[24-Jan-21 06:48 PM] cory!#8287
yeah she gave me bad vibes


[24-Jan-21 06:48 PM] lyss#0709
yikesssss


[24-Jan-21 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
Does that mean littleglow is leaking too


[24-Jan-21 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
Well goodbye to Vicky


[24-Jan-21 06:51 PM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue ask who else was in that gc


[24-Jan-21 06:51 PM] cory!#8287
i dont think little is friends with kylie


[24-Jan-21 06:51 PM] cory!#8287
but im sure she will leak to vicky when shes terminated


[24-Jan-21 06:51 PM] stacey#1000
Probably idk


[24-Jan-21 06:51 PM] stacey#1000
Unless little was in that gc


[24-Jan-21 06:52 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ok

[24-Jan-21 06:53 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey


[24-Jan-21 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
And ayesha thought she had a chance to appeal


[24-Jan-21 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
Mk so let’s get to terminating her then


[24-Jan-21 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
add a vote to terminate


[24-Jan-21 06:54 PM] lyss#0709
yup yup wow


[24-Jan-21 06:54 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we also have to decide when we'll let kylie appeal bcuz


[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
I mean


[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe in a month


[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] courtney#5125

[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ok ill tell her


[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
I’d say a month if she shows improvement still


[24-Jan-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
But it also doesn’t guarantee it would be accepted


[24-Jan-21 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
Who’s firing


[24-Jan-21 06:56 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[24-Jan-21 07:20 PM] courtney#5125
justtt letting yall know that it looks like onechicagocanary sorta leaked svc2 during my themed session earlier. doesnt really seem like a big deal considering its not like she leaked any contents of any channels, and it seemed like an honest mistake. just an fyi though https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/BISmaHdZO2v4e2F0U3sNNoN1d9HSDdaAzW7ejJJepbY/https/i.gyazo.com/09ef883f73ac95245045dd38586760ba.mp4

she dmed me as well


[24-Jan-21 07:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053

@bonnie591 CAN WE GET A SENIOR VOTE


[24-Jan-21 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
we need more seniors


[24-Jan-21 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
most of my servers get  0 hosts


[24-Jan-21 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
for the past 2 weeks


[24-Jan-21 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
i need to tag for every session


[24-Jan-21 08:04 PM] courtney#5125
yeah im lucky if i get even a single senior to ask to host


[24-Jan-21 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
yeah same here


[24-Jan-21 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
vac for senior!!


[24-Jan-21 08:08 PM] courtney#5125
i want jackson and/or emma


[24-Jan-21 08:09 PM] lyss#0709
JACKSONJACKSONJACKSON


[24-Jan-21 08:09 PM] lyss#0709
and emma


[24-Jan-21 08:09 PM] lyss#0709
BUT I ALSO REALLY WANT MENDO


[24-Jan-21 08:09 PM] courtney#5125
those three are my favorite 😭


[24-Jan-21 08:14 PM] courtney#5125
vac's been a manager for a while but i just never see him everrrr


[24-Jan-21 08:14 PM] lyss#0709
yeah hes been here forever but his activity is no match at all for some other managers'


[24-Jan-21 08:15 PM] lyss#0709
+ a lot of others have a better personality and are nice to ppl


[24-Jan-21 08:15 PM] lyss#0709
but


[24-Jan-21 08:17 PM] cory!#8287
i'd def vote for mendo but idk who else


[24-Jan-21 08:19 PM] lyss#0709
id vote for mendo and jackson if we can even have a vote, and then id probably vote for emma and maybe vac next time theres a vote


[24-Jan-21 08:19 PM] courtney#5125
^^


[24-Jan-21 08:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
How's addie been doing?


[24-Jan-21 08:22 PM] lyss#0709
i think addie would be a good candidate in another vote too


[24-Jan-21 08:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
the only thing about being getting senior is breaking the tradition of going to sessions together


[24-Jan-21 08:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
we should just do a hire 5 more, problem solved.


[24-Jan-21 08:27 PM] cory!#8287
id totally vote for addie but shes been in a lot of trouble


[24-Jan-21 08:28 PM] lyss#0709
thats true


[24-Jan-21 08:28 PM] lyss#0709
i for sure just want mendo and jackson in the near future and definitely emma later on since shes newer than some others


[24-Jan-21 08:29 PM] courtney#5125
yeahhh def same as lyss


[24-Jan-21 08:30 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I didn't know Addie account shared..


[24-Jan-21 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
vac is very active


[24-Jan-21 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
he attends sessions everday


[24-Jan-21 08:36 PM] courtney#5125
i never see him D:


[24-Jan-21 08:37 PM] courtney#5125
he doesnt have the best past compared to a lot of other managers either


[24-Jan-21 08:37 PM] lyss#0709
i mean i just personally think a few other managers have double or triple his activity, but id vote for him in the future still


[24-Jan-21 08:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
When’d she account share?


[24-Jan-21 08:49 PM] courtney#5125
i thought that was where she was initially terminated for it but it was found out that she never did


[24-Jan-21 08:49 PM] courtney#5125
so she was reinstated


[24-Jan-21 08:50 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Oh


[24-Jan-21 09:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
hmm


[24-Jan-21 09:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ok


[24-Jan-21 09:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
nvm then


[24-Jan-21 09:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I would expect min to delete the card or put a comment


[24-Jan-21 10:47 PM] stacey#1000
vac goes to my sessions all the time


[24-Jan-21 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
every time I request for a manager he is there and hes been a manager over a year


[24-Jan-21 10:48 PM] stacey#1000
so id vote for vac


[24-Jan-21 10:48 PM] courtney#5125
id vote for him in the future, rn there are managers with a better past and better attitudes imo


[25-Jan-21 03:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe


[25-Jan-21 03:33 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey hey so I’m asking you because I know you’re close with Megan but if I’m not mistaken I’ve seen Megan on Firestone patrolling, and on her inactivity notice it says she doesn’t have access to Roblox? Caught my eye rn as I was doing checklist and noticed I have seen her couple times on Firestone


[25-Jan-21 06:42 AM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez she patrolled a couple of times and now she is not at home again. She hasn’t been on very much. She’s have a lot of problems with her family rn that’s personal.


[25-Jan-21 06:42 AM] stacey#1000
She is getting a warning for activity on firestone rn.


[25-Jan-21 06:44 AM] stacey#1000
She was on maybe twice when she went home, then something happened where she is not at home again. Let’s just say she is not in the healthiest relationship with her family right now and doesn’t want to be at home too often. So her notice is still valid.


[25-Jan-21 06:44 AM] ethan;#0003
she is on everyd ay


[25-Jan-21 06:44 AM] ethan;#0003
every single day


[25-Jan-21 06:44 AM] stacey#1000
She is not


[25-Jan-21 06:44 AM] ethan;#0003
or every other day


[25-Jan-21 06:44 AM] ethan;#0003
she is playing games with you


[25-Jan-21 06:45 AM] stacey#1000
She hasn’t been on the past 4 days


[25-Jan-21 06:45 AM] stacey#1000
She wasn’t home for 2 weeks. Went home for maybe 3 days and was on for 2 days, then is not home again.


[25-Jan-21 06:46 AM] stacey#1000
I can’t really discuss her personal life rn but trust me she is not in the best situation rn


[25-Jan-21 06:47 AM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez I recommend messaging her about it she might tell you


[25-Jan-21 06:52 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll talk to her and tell her to message you

disappointing 😔


[25-Jan-21 03:53 PM] cory!#8287
is ayesha blacklisted or just banned from the discord server


[25-Jan-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
perm banned from the discord


[25-Jan-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
but actually


[25-Jan-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
we probably should blacklist her because she encouraged vicky to leak


[25-Jan-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
in fact, rylee, lily, annie, all of them were in that gc with vicky leaking


[25-Jan-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
so all of them encouraged her and should be blacklisted


[25-Jan-21 04:02 PM] cory!#8287
yeahh and i got proof of her being homophobic so 😳


[25-Jan-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
blacklist all of them


[25-Jan-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
rylee, ayesha, lily, annie


[25-Jan-21 04:02 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[25-Jan-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
because they all knew vicky was leaking


[25-Jan-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
so...


[25-Jan-21 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue who was all in that gc again

AwesomeGirl2386


[25-Jan-21 04:09 PM] lyss#0709
shes highly involved with them and their toxicity


[25-Jan-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
is she an LR


[25-Jan-21 04:09 PM] lyss#0709
yeah


[25-Jan-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
so if thats her and she knew an MR was leaking


[25-Jan-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
and did nothing and encouraged it too


[25-Jan-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
then she can get blacklisted


[25-Jan-21 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
but idk who noah is


[25-Jan-21 04:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey guessing there's been no leaking amongst managers since poky got promoted


[25-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000

ChowChowderCookie has transferred their receptionist rank to s6ncak due to their account being hacked. Just noting here in case anyone needs to know.


[26-Jan-21 05:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! hey what did Annie recently do to get blacklisted


[26-Jan-21 07:28 AM] cory!#8287
disrespectful to MRs and HRs, toxic, in a gc with someone who leaked and didn’t report it


[26-Jan-21 07:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
Was the disrespectful to me and hr, toxic done within the last week? @cory!


[26-Jan-21 07:53 AM] bonnie591#0591
I'm presuming the being in a gc with someone who leaked was recent


[26-Jan-21 08:06 AM] cory!#8287
yeah the gc was recent but the disrespect was when ryley aysha lily and her got banned from the discord for mocking candy and Stacey in general and unnecessary drama. The toxicity was also during that time but probably still continues


[26-Jan-21 08:26 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[26-Jan-21 08:42 AM] anna#0004

people kylie mentioned


[26-Jan-21 08:43 AM] anna#0004
the only lr i think was in the gc was emily (awesomegirl2386)


[26-Jan-21 08:43 AM] anna#0004
oh yes


[26-Jan-21 08:45 AM] cory!#8287
ok I can blacklist them later since I’m on mobile


[26-Jan-21 08:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! so they were blacklisted for not reporting something


[26-Jan-21 08:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
Or am I missing something


[26-Jan-21 08:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
@anna @Tattoblue


[26-Jan-21 08:52 AM] anna#0004
as far as  ik ya


[26-Jan-21 08:53 AM] bonnie591#0591
I'll wait for Cory's confirmation before I unblacklist


[26-Jan-21 08:53 AM] cory!#8287
yeah and the other stuff


[26-Jan-21 08:54 AM] bonnie591#0591
The other stuff wasnt in the last week correct @cory!


[26-Jan-21 08:55 AM] cory!#8287
nope it was around 2-3 weeks ago I believe


[26-Jan-21 08:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
Okay thanks, they will be blacklisted.


[26-Jan-21 08:57 AM] cory!#8287
no problem


[26-Jan-21 08:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
oh oops


[26-Jan-21 08:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
unblacklisted*


[26-Jan-21 09:01 AM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 should ryley and lily get unblacklisted then cause I Blacklisted them for the same reasons of annie


[26-Jan-21 09:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! which ones are involved with this thing. aka the ones that did same as annie

if ryley and lily did same as annie, then yes they will be unblacklisted unless they did something additional


[26-Jan-21 09:12 AM] cory!#8287
them and daisie


[26-Jan-21 09:13 AM] cory!#8287
not ayesah tho cause shes the one that made her leak and is homophobic


[26-Jan-21 09:13 AM] cory!#8287
and not amzire cause he’s Blacklisted for another reason then them


[26-Jan-21 09:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
im presuming devhil is "ryley"


[26-Jan-21 09:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
or am i wrong


[26-Jan-21 09:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! @anna


[26-Jan-21 09:15 AM] cory!#8287
yes


[26-Jan-21 09:15 AM] cory!#8287
that’s ryley


[26-Jan-21 09:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
to expand on ayesha, is there proof that she made the person leak


[26-Jan-21 09:16 AM] cory!#8287
yes I think let me see


[26-Jan-21 09:16 AM] Tattoblue#5828
i asked kylie if she had any screenshots im waiting for her to respond @bonnie591


[26-Jan-21 09:16 AM] Tattoblue#5828
but no


[26-Jan-21 09:16 AM] Tattoblue#5828
no screenshots


[26-Jan-21 09:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok thx tatto


[26-Jan-21 09:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! if you got any lmk


[26-Jan-21 09:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
the homophobic incident lacks context, is nothing to do with bloxton and kinda looks like a joke tbh so that reason is void


[26-Jan-21 09:21 AM] cory!#8287
ok I thought there was proof somewhere in general cause Stacey said something about her encouraging her to leak but ig there’s not


[26-Jan-21 09:22 AM] cory!#8287
trey sent me more proof of her being homophobic tho so idk if that’s like blacklist worthy still or not


[26-Jan-21 09:23 AM] bonnie591#0591
i mean its wrong to be homophobic ik, but we cant really enforce a blacklist unless she did it in the bloxton server, a bloxton game or maybe even an alliance server or game


[26-Jan-21 09:23 AM] bonnie591#0591
final question good sir

[26-Jan-21 09:27 AM] bonnie591#0591

[26-Jan-21 09:27 AM] bonnie591#0591
just to be 100% sure


[26-Jan-21 09:27 AM] bonnie591#0591

[26-Jan-21 09:31 AM] stacey#1000

[26-Jan-21 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
Let me find it

But ya I guess if there is no solid evidence she can get unblacklisted but I still don’t trust either of them


[26-Jan-21 09:35 AM] anna#0004
i think theyre all gonna lay off bloxton bc they want a chance to appeal in the future


[26-Jan-21 09:35 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah theyre all reporting each other which is funni

[26-Jan-21 09:38 AM] stacey#1000
All of them knowing an mr actively leaked and didn’t report it makes it worse for them


[26-Jan-21 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
At least in my opinion


[26-Jan-21 09:53 AM] stacey#1000

[26-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
This is why I said all of them should be blacklisted @bonnie591


[26-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Especially ayesha


[26-Jan-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
At least lily, Annie, rylee, ayesha


[26-Jan-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
I’m blacklisting ayesha again


[26-Jan-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000

[26-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue ask what ayesha roblox account is. Is it sorryiclosedadoor?


[26-Jan-21 11:39 AM] cory!#8287

[26-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
Blacklist her again if you can


[26-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
She’s the main one that encouraged the leaking


[26-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
Now with solid evidence ty tattoo!!!


[26-Jan-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000

[26-Jan-21 11:40 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[26-Jan-21 11:41 AM] cory!#8287

[26-Jan-21 11:41 AM] stacey#1000

[26-Jan-21 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue ask if rylee, Lilly, and Annie encouraged the leaking


[26-Jan-21 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
And if there is evidence of it


[26-Jan-21 11:42 AM] stacey#1000

**__PROMOTION SUGGESTIONS - UPDATE__**

Hello, Managers!

The HR Team thought it would be a good idea to let you guys vote on other people's promotion suggestions! To vote, you are basically reacting to the person's promotion suggestion with either a checkmark, an X, or an exclamation mark.

----------------
:checkmark: = Agree
:xmark: = Disagree
❕ = Neutral (In the middle/no vote)
----------------

If you disagree with a suggestion, criticism or an explanation why is recommended, but not required. Any additional feedback about an employee is also recommended! You can only suggest LRs for the Head position, not any Heads+. When you create a promotion suggestion, you already automatically agree, so you would add the reactions listed above so others can vote. If you see that your promotion suggestion has been promoted, then I recommend deleting the card to avoid any further voting.

__Extra information:__
- Don't duplicate a promo suggestion if it's already getting voted on.
- If your promo suggestion gets around 20-30 disagreements, then you can delete the suggestion.
- Follow the same format as before: Username | Rank | 5+ sentences on why they deserve a promotion | Picture of their avatar.
- You can also add images of them working hard, being professional, being helpful, etc. to your promotion suggestion.

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know in #management-lounge. Thanks and have a good day!

*Sincerely,*
**cvoryy**
**Shift Manager**
**Bloxton Hotels**

[27-Jan-21 04:13 PM] cory!#8287
added a vote


[27-Jan-21 04:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Confused.. uh "(3 heads,  8 MRs, 3 MRs)"


[27-Jan-21 04:15 PM] cory!#8287
idk what he meant about the 3 heads but he probably meant 8 mrs at ints and 3 mrs at the hotel


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] katie#0200
yikes i was in her server at the hotel i should have noticed :facepalm:


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
The thing is


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
Have we actually made announcements regarding this?


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
Suspending someone for forgetting the MR limit is a bit strict


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] cory!#8287
yeah pretty sure


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] katie#0200
she wasn't forgetting it


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] katie#0200
she was outright refusing to listen to others when they told her she joined over the limit


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
She ignored other MRs telling her about it


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Ye


[27-Jan-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
Have the HR team themselves reminded her and warned her?


[27-Jan-21 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
Has she ever been given an official warning regarding it?


[27-Jan-21 04:17 PM] cory!#8287
i warned her to not tell others about terminations a while ago


[27-Jan-21 04:17 PM] cory!#8287
like verbally warned her


[27-Jan-21 04:17 PM] cory!#8287
but not about the limit


[27-Jan-21 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
I mean for the limit


[27-Jan-21 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
But since she has done more then that


[27-Jan-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
Then sure suspend but if not was for the MR limit alone that’s a bit strict to suspend for


[27-Jan-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
When she’s never been warned regarding it


[27-Jan-21 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
And we have also not made announcements regarding it since she’s been an MR I think


[27-Jan-21 04:19 PM] katie#0200
i mean i think a suspension's fair since she's literally choosing not to follow the mr limit rule when she's reminded of it several times, that's basically a warning/reminder in itself


[27-Jan-21 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
How long has she been an MR


[27-Jan-21 04:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah, but a few days ago/ last week bonnie asked heads to go through the pinned staff announcements and one of the pinned announcements is about head limits


[27-Jan-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
Oh nvm


[27-Jan-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
Ok you can suspend but get BOD approval


[27-Jan-21 04:20 PM] cory!#8287
does anyone wanna suspend her


[27-Jan-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
No I’m not going on pc tonight


[27-Jan-21 04:21 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 @Bloo_Berriez also do we have perms to suspend libby


[27-Jan-21 04:21 PM] katie#0200
i can if no one else wants to


[27-Jan-21 04:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure


[27-Jan-21 04:21 PM] katie#0200
how long?


[27-Jan-21 04:21 PM] cory!#8287
maybe 3 days


[27-Jan-21 04:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sounds good


[27-Jan-21 04:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[27-Jan-21 04:24 PM] katie#0200

[27-Jan-21 04:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[27-Jan-21 04:31 PM] katie#0200

[27-Jan-21 05:34 PM] anna#0004
oh yeah i said not rlly as we have to respect the persons privacy and she said "what if theyre talking to u about it" and i was basically saying she can talk about it with them if theyre fine with it but not in public places like staff lounge

what’s lithp


[27-Jan-21 09:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@cory! People are telling me how Chico was a CB


[27-Jan-21 09:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think they're just misspelling lisp @cory!


[27-Jan-21 09:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And right when they said "They're in the VC" she left


[27-Jan-21 09:39 PM] cory!#8287
yeah maybe it’s her


[27-Jan-21 09:39 PM] cory!#8287
but like 2 people told me it was Fallon


[27-Jan-21 09:39 PM] cory!#8287
Sam and her


[27-Jan-21 09:39 PM] cory!#8287

We can rule out the seniors


[27-Jan-21 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
We know it’s not a senior


[27-Jan-21 09:40 PM] cory!#8287
cause they said Fallon and her don’t like each other


[27-Jan-21 09:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But I don't think fallon has been in the vc tho


[27-Jan-21 09:40 PM] cory!#8287
yeah exactly


[27-Jan-21 09:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Others told me Aidan but he wasn't in vc either?


[27-Jan-21 09:41 PM] cory!#8287
I don’t think so


[27-Jan-21 09:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It has to be someone in the VC, I'm honestly looking at Chico


[27-Jan-21 09:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I haven't seen him pop up in it


[27-Jan-21 09:41 PM] cory!#8287
if you wanted to you could post the link in a management channel and see if they join then


[27-Jan-21 09:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Because Kyle told me as soon as they said "Yep they're in the VC" chico had to go eat dinner but idk tbh


[27-Jan-21 09:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
True, but I have to get going soon unless you wanna host like another MM2 with only managements.


[27-Jan-21 09:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Or even Arsenal


[27-Jan-21 09:42 PM] cory!#8287
I’m on mobile rn so I can’t but maybe someone else can idk


[27-Jan-21 09:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Kj? @KjRBLX If you want you could.


[27-Jan-21 09:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i could


[27-Jan-21 09:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but wouldn't that it obvious?


[27-Jan-21 09:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
make it obvious that we're trying to rule them out?


[27-Jan-21 09:50 PM] cory!#8287
i mean if you don’t make it look obvious I don’t think it will


[27-Jan-21 09:52 PM] cory!#8287
ngl there’s a 99.9% chance it’s a head cause I DOUBT BEX Kyle and jj would leak the link


[27-Jan-21 09:52 PM] cory!#8287
since they’re the only manager+ in that vc


[27-Jan-21 09:58 PM] cory!#8287
I asked her abt it before it was announced

[28-Jan-21 11:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
Ohh uh I don't think it's massively classified tbh


[28-Jan-21 11:08 AM] katie#0200

[28-Jan-21 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez was selma at the gamenight


[28-Jan-21 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
last night


[28-Jan-21 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
she was in vc but was she in game


[28-Jan-21 02:37 PM] ethan;#0003
and it would have to be someone new


[28-Jan-21 02:37 PM] ethan;#0003
who hasn't heard jj's voice before


[28-Jan-21 02:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
she was in the game @ethan;


[28-Jan-21 04:00 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez so i was searching through discord logs and stuff i have 2 people who im sus about


[28-Jan-21 04:00 PM] ethan;#0003
fa9ke and onechicagocanary


[28-Jan-21 04:01 PM] ethan;#0003
where either of them in the game


[28-Jan-21 04:01 PM] ethan;#0003
when it happend


[28-Jan-21 04:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Chico I’m really sus about, idk about Fake though although I did have like an MR or two dm me saying Fake was a little sus. A lot of MRs have bringing up Fallon.


[28-Jan-21 04:02 PM] ethan;#0003
what i think happend, is it might not of been one of them, they sent the link to CB's


[28-Jan-21 04:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yes because there were 2 alt accounts on playing


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
wasnt it 4


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
or 3


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
where either one of them in the game


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
actually, in total about 4 but at the time, 2 were playing at the same time so it was 2 people


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
fake or chicago


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Fake was playing, went offline but Chico was on the call but she wasn’t online.


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
so


[28-Jan-21 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
chico wasnt in the game


[28-Jan-21 04:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Apparently Fallon admitted he was a CB to Chico before they got promoted


[28-Jan-21 04:04 PM] ethan;#0003
fake was the first person to bring it up

[28-Jan-21 04:05 PM] ethan;#0003

[28-Jan-21 04:05 PM] ethan;#0003
cus ive never seen him in staff vc


[28-Jan-21 04:06 PM] ethan;#0003
i havent really seen him at all


[28-Jan-21 04:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
You know who I wanted to question, was Tr2vl cause he’s the one who told me Fallon told chico he was a cb apparently

Think the pics went out of order oops. 2nd one is where it starts


[28-Jan-21 04:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I could host another game night and see if it happens again.


[28-Jan-21 04:12 PM] ethan;#0003
i think suspend fallon for investigation and then talk to travel then talk to fallon

@High Rank sorry for the ping, could anyone quickly lend me their management promo guide? Daphivrns is in my server and my guide is in my notes on my other computer, which I will need to boot up to access, which will probably take ages

We should just stop hosting MR gamenights rn


[29-Jan-21 04:14 PM] ethan;#0003
suspend those 3 host another gamenight if it gets leaked its not them


[29-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
And tell seniors to stop hosting them for rn too


[29-Jan-21 04:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Or what we could do is, host another one and while Fallon is suspended see if it keeps happening?


[29-Jan-21 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[29-Jan-21 04:14 PM] ethan;#0003

Alright, well if no one is against Kitty being suspended then we can see if this game night leaking still happens


[29-Jan-21 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
If you host a epic minigames gamenight you can buy at thing that gives you admin on it and unlimited thing to choose minigames


[29-Jan-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
So then you can kick people

[29-Jan-21 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
Then suspend aiden and take his roles away. Post link so he can’t see and see if anyone joins


[29-Jan-21 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
If no one joins we know it’s him


[29-Jan-21 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
If someone joins it’s not


[29-Jan-21 05:09 PM] stacey#1000

Greetings diorsglare,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as Management from Bloxton Hotels as of 12/8/20 @ 10:00 PM EST. The reasoning behind your termination is due to sharing malicious IP grabber links, cyber-bullying an individual, and promoting an inappropriate group on the Roblox platform which is in violation of the Roblox Terms of Service. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly.

Signed,

ikeatie
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels

[29-Jan-21 06:44 PM] ethan;#0003

I can't verify if the guy has safechat right now cuz im not in a server with them but someone info'd and got that


[29-Jan-21 08:10 PM] stacey#1000

[29-Jan-21 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
you have to get them to say c7rn


[29-Jan-21 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; was the link leaked again


[29-Jan-21 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
NO


[29-Jan-21 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
ca[s


[29-Jan-21 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
caps


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
so it is aidan


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
or one of the other people suspended


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
idk whos all suspended


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003
not kitty


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003
i think its safe to unsuspend kitty


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
who else was suspended


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003
its aidan 100%


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003
fallon is also suspended


[29-Jan-21 08:11 PM] ethan;#0003
but on top o fthat


[29-Jan-21 08:12 PM] ethan;#0003
there where reports of him being a cb


[29-Jan-21 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
who leaked their suspension thing


[29-Jan-21 08:12 PM] ethan;#0003
so he cant be unsuspended yet


[29-Jan-21 08:12 PM] ethan;#0003
fallon did


[29-Jan-21 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
cant he get fired for leaking an investigation


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] ethan;#0003
i think fallon should get fired for leaking an investigation, that would take care of him being a potetial CB


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] ethan;#0003
wich he probs is


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] ethan;#0003
and aivdan im waiting for him to respond back


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
aidan is legit just too sus


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
its him


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
we have been sus of him forever


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] ethan;#0003
ik its him


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
hence why he never got management


[29-Jan-21 08:13 PM] ethan;#0003
ive been saying it for months


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
he was suspended for questioning back in the summer


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
we got nothing


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
but now we know


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
when i sent him the suspension message


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
he responded with


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
...


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
probs was like


[29-Jan-21 08:14 PM] ethan;#0003
"WHO TF SNITCHED"


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
probably


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
he probably been fake offline


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
messaging people panicking


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] ethan;#0003
and tatto brought up a point how he is faking his timezone


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
hes BST timezone


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] ethan;#0003
his timezone when i suspnded him was ICT


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
I confirmed that last investigation


[29-Jan-21 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
hes BST 100%


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
but I dont have evidence of it from last investigation


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
it was months ago


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] ethan;#0003
and also he sitched discord in november


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] ethan;#0003
but it was gone


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
and he knows we were sus of him from when I suspended him before


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
I was sus of him since June cause he was close with gotme


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] ethan;#0003
did u look up his alt on the hr board


[29-Jan-21 08:16 PM] ethan;#0003
to see what he did


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
sent pornographic images....


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
in general


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
No i didnt suspend him for that


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
no his alt


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
that we found today


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
when his alt joined env tops


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
then i did some searching


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
they both have the exact same interests


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
and are in each others groups


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
ya hes done for this time


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
following each other


[29-Jan-21 08:17 PM] ethan;#0003
both are obsessed with assasin


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] stacey#1000
we should fire him for being sus alone at this point


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] ethan;#0003
when i added him to gc with tatto


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] ethan;#0003
he just went offline


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] stacey#1000
he stayed thinking he had a chance at management


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] ethan;#0003
kept going online and offline


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] stacey#1000
to leak even more stuff


[29-Jan-21 08:18 PM] ethan;#0003

did it say specifically not to share this with others and keep the investigation quiet


[29-Jan-21 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
i cant read it in that


[29-Jan-21 08:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
she basically copy and pasted the message she got when we suspended her @stacey

Canary said this about Fallon


[29-Jan-21 08:23 PM] ethan;#0003
i think we unsuspend kitty, since there is nothing solid on him. Fire aidan, investigate fallon


[29-Jan-21 08:23 PM] ethan;#0003
everying from the past months have just added up to aidan


[29-Jan-21 08:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Can’t wait to see Aidan’s response


[29-Jan-21 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
he saw he was suspended


[29-Jan-21 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
he responded with


[29-Jan-21 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
"..."


[29-Jan-21 08:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he’s probably panicking cause he doesn’t know what to say


[29-Jan-21 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
then started ghosting me while online on roblox and discord


[29-Jan-21 08:25 PM] ethan;#0003
but now he is apparently asleep because he is apparently bst but he lied about his timezone


[29-Jan-21 08:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And it’s funny, there’s no more leaker for game nights


[29-Jan-21 08:26 PM] ethan;#0003
this was INSTANTLY seconds after i suspended aidan

[29-Jan-21 09:37 PM] cory!#8287

[29-Jan-21 09:43 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn @Bloo_Berriez @Polk aidan considers himself fired can it be offical that he is fired

Alright so now Aidan’s gone, we gotta get back to Fallon


[29-Jan-21 09:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
also @ethan; I think we can unsuspend kitty unless he also went around sending messages about him being investigated

:molivestare:


[29-Jan-21 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
i asked him


[29-Jan-21 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
after he knew he was being fired


[29-Jan-21 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
he started being honest


[29-Jan-21 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
i asked him if he had any suspicions of people


[29-Jan-21 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
he gave a few


[29-Jan-21 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
but i im pretty sure it isnt any of them


[29-Jan-21 09:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[29-Jan-21 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 09:59 PM] ethan;#0003
at the end


[29-Jan-21 09:59 PM] ethan;#0003
right before i kicked him from the chat


[29-Jan-21 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 10:00 PM] stacey#1000

[29-Jan-21 10:00 PM] stacey#1000

[29-Jan-21 10:01 PM] ethan;#0003

If it wasn’t Aidan


[29-Jan-21 10:02 PM] stacey#1000

I think it’s Fallon


[29-Jan-21 10:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Ethan you hosted a game night, and no one joined?


[29-Jan-21 10:03 PM] stacey#1000
It is possible they didn’t leak that one knowing people were suspended for it


[29-Jan-21 10:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
True, but there was another one earlier too I think right after both of them were suspended and nothing but who knows.


[29-Jan-21 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
I just won’t host MR gamenights often


[29-Jan-21 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
I rarely ever did anyways

[29-Jan-21 10:11 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 10:11 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jan-21 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I think it was him


[29-Jan-21 10:11 PM] ethan;#0003
at the end of the investigation he showed his true coloors


[29-Jan-21 10:11 PM] ethan;#0003
and how much of an ass hole he actually is


[29-Jan-21 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
They won’t get leaked terminations anymore


[29-Jan-21 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
No more tea for them


[29-Jan-21 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
This is also exactly why I don’t let heads help at my theme sessions


[29-Jan-21 10:18 PM] ethan;#0003
if someone wants to unsuspend kitty and tell him he is unsuspended im way ttoo tired to do it rn


[29-Jan-21 10:34 PM] courtney#5125

oh


[31-Jan-21 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
wasnt sure if you were all aware so just letting you know


[31-Jan-21 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
she shouldnt have been appealed...


[31-Jan-21 06:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
today is like problems rush hour


[31-Jan-21 06:39 PM] cory!#8287
i thought that was a random person oops


[31-Jan-21 06:40 PM] lyss#0709
i knew it was her just didnt know she wasnt allowed to appeal apparently?


[31-Jan-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
well


[31-Jan-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
you all voted no fast not to appeal rack right


[31-Jan-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
well stinky did the same stuff rack did and was highly involved in trash talking us in their CB server


[31-Jan-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
stinky, diego, rack, sooty, booma, all cbs I wouldnt consider appealing


[31-Jan-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
but I guess its too late now


[31-Jan-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
but next time you get a CB appeal pls lmk cause uh


[31-Jan-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
yeah stinky got appealed


[31-Jan-21 06:42 PM] anna#0004
if she continues her old ways then she'll just get banned again so we'll just have to keep an eye on her


[31-Jan-21 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
I did tell her she could appeal in feb but I was going to tell u it was stinky so we could deny it


[31-Jan-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
for now yeah we cant do much but keep an eye on her


[31-Jan-21 06:43 PM] anna#0004
mhmm


[31-Jan-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
but this is why all the other cbs are appealing now


[31-Jan-21 06:49 PM] anna#0004
i feel like her appeal was more genuine and the others saw she got appealed and quickly wrote one up. and she hasn't been to the hotel in ages, so i doubt she'll cause any trouble. obviously doesnt excuse her from everything she's done in the past but i mean if shes not going to cause trouble then i guess her being in the server and stuff wont hurt and if she *does* start acting up then itll only take a second to ban and then she wont ever be appealed again


[31-Jan-21 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
true


[31-Jan-21 06:50 PM] stacey#1000
it doesnt hurt to appeal some cbs but there is just some Id never appeal like diego and rack for sure never getting appealed


[31-Jan-21 06:50 PM] anna#0004
yeah defo


[31-Jan-21 08:45 PM] cory!#8287

"confused on how this promotion system works" Well you're not suppose to know how it works because people could cheat it


[31-Jan-21 09:30 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They want to stay anonymous.
