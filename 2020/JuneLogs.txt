[01-Jun-20 03:51 PM] emma;#1525
do you know why she even took a few months off


[01-Jun-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
She came on discord for an hour or so after a month of nothing then made a new inactive notice and then  left again


[01-Jun-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
Not really


[01-Jun-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
She keeps saying for school and taking care of her younger sister and her mom and stuff


[01-Jun-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
Or something


[01-Jun-20 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt like how I have to contact her on Snapchat to get her reply, she doesn‚Äôt even respond to that all the time

[01-Jun-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
she needs an end date


[01-Jun-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
and she needs to archive or extend the other one


[01-Jun-20 03:54 PM] Beartikal#9760

Bonnie when are you promoting Uni


[01-Jun-20 04:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sometime this week


[01-Jun-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
If you hosted an earlier bst session  she would probably go


[01-Jun-20 04:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
She attends my server every session so whenever I host next ig


[01-Jun-20 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
She attends every session


[01-Jun-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I want to be invited so let me know when


[01-Jun-20 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
Every time of the day


[01-Jun-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
Which is why she is getting management!!!


[01-Jun-20 04:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
@bman send doqee a notice saying if they fail to do anything next week then they risk a demotion to mangement (too early for a termination for inactivity)


[01-Jun-20 04:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Did bloo say anything to doq


[01-Jun-20 04:06 PM] bonnie591#0591

[01-Jun-20 04:06 PM] bman#0435

[01-Jun-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Why is he still inactive


[01-Jun-20 04:06 PM] ethan;#0003
Bearvish has a legitimate notice


[01-Jun-20 04:07 PM] bman#0435

[02-Jun-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
considering today is blackouttuesday


[02-Jun-20 01:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think we should go back once the day is over


[02-Jun-20 01:37 PM] emma;#1525
i think making our server icon black for the day and saying something short like "We've changed our icon for blackout tuesday in support of the true BLM movement." will do more good than bad lol


[02-Jun-20 01:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
I posted that black out Tuesday thing on Instagram


[02-Jun-20 01:37 PM] emma;#1525
NOT doing anything will look sketchy but this isn't even really about looking good or bad


[02-Jun-20 01:38 PM] emma;#1525
its about doing the right thing


[02-Jun-20 01:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Also I thought my Instagram wasn't working this morning lol


[02-Jun-20 01:38 PM] xM_inn#2821

well


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We should do it


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
instead of having the server rainbow for the entire of pride month


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
why not just pride day?


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
SO today do black icon and short announcement, tomorrow change to a rainbow icon (prob need ramm to do that bc he has the icon i believe) and a pride month support statement?


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
which is the 14th of June I THINK


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
that would be good


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
minn


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
we can do that


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
ya


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt think we'd have it the entire month anyways


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
but pride day is the most important so lets do that


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
are we changing our pfps


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But Emma


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
yee


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] emma;#1525
i might just bc like why not


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We're homophobic remember üò≠


[02-Jun-20 01:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
idk story


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay that's enough


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
imagine if we all made our pfps black omg


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn do you have a large pic of our logo


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] emma;#1525
or does anyone


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
one second


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] emma;#1525
bc i can edit it against a black background and make it like dark grey


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The icon is 500x500 isn't it


[02-Jun-20 01:40 PM] emma;#1525
so that ppl can still tell our server apart

take ur pick


[02-Jun-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
what if we made the bloxton logo rainbow and rotating on a black screen


[02-Jun-20 01:41 PM] emma;#1525
ok i'll see what i can do


[02-Jun-20 01:41 PM] emma;#1525
@bman again these are both important things, we shouldn't be combining them


[02-Jun-20 01:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we do them both together ppl gonna get confused


[02-Jun-20 01:41 PM] emma;#1525
we'll focus on BLM today bc that's what matters today


[02-Jun-20 01:41 PM] emma;#1525
on pride day we can do the rainbow pfp


[02-Jun-20 01:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
and then on my birthday we can do a birthday theme cause that is also an important thing this month

[02-Jun-20 02:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; complaint from slee:

This message is in regards to the recent changing of the Bloxton Hotel's Server Icon. Before I go any further, allow me to make it very clear I have no problem with the Black Lives Matter movement; however, I do have a problem when a ROBLOX group makes the decision to take actions that strongly relate to politics. There's a lot going on in the United States right now after the murder of George Floyd and many people are using this death as an excuse for their actions including killing police officers, hurting police officers, burning government buildings, vehicles, etc. For Bloxton Hotels to be taking a stance on this subject is completely unprofessional in my personal opinion especially considering the tensions within the topic. Bloxton hasn't made statements about political matters in the past and this matter is definitely not something to start it with. To make it perfectly clear, I have no problem with this movement and I personally support it; however, it does not belong where it is being used. I'd greatly appreciate it if you would take appropriate action on this. Thank you in advance.
And allow me to add that when I stated "are we really doing this here", I was confronted by Emma rather harshly and essentially told to keep my mouth shut and instead DM an HR. Emma jumped to the conclusion that I was speaking against this movement and I did not appreciate that as well.


[02-Jun-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
he knows blm has nothing to do with george floyd right-


[02-Jun-20 02:51 PM] bman#0435
blm is being more heard and is using that situation to support their movement


[02-Jun-20 02:52 PM] bman#0435
and what does he want us to do lmfao. we already made the announcement and changed the icon. he isnt an hr anymore so he doesnt know what we agreed with for this

[02-Jun-20 03:02 PM] bman#0435
"@Slee_20 well it just seems like you were questioning why we chose to do this which any of us would be happy to talk about but we dont need MRs being in gd saying "are we seriously bringing this here" lol"


[02-Jun-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435
"@Slee_20 i didnt mean that u were starting drama i meant this is a touchy subject and people seeing an MR say "why are we bringing this here" could influence them to start drama"

what did u do lol


[02-Jun-20 03:03 PM] emma;#1525
I honestly didn't think that I confronted you "harshly" considering all I asked was that you don't speak out against us in general discussion like that, especially against movements people are so passionate about, and I even clarified that I was worried that other people would try to start drama with you and not that I thought you were trying to start drama. Honestly Slee, the fact that you interpreted that as an attack or something speaks volumes. Where did I tell you to "shut up and DM an HR"? I clearly remember asking you to either DM an HR or ask us in SL instead of in general discussion bc gd is on a hairpin trigger for drama at all times and seeing an MR question the movement (which wasn't your intention ik but how it came off) could have started a big argument. You shouldn't have said what you did in general and I could have responded in a different way I suppose but I don't appreciate you trying to accuse me of telling you to shut up when that just never happened.

"I honestly didn't think that I confronted you "harshly" considering all I asked was that you don't speak out against us in general discussion like that, especially against movements people are so passionate about, and I even clarified that I was worried that other people would try to start drama with you and not that I thought you were trying to start drama. Honestly Slee, the fact that you interpreted that as an attack or something speaks volumes. Where did I tell you to "shut up and DM an HR"? I clearly remember asking you to either DM an HR or ask us in SL instead of in general discussion bc gd is on a hairpin trigger for drama at all times and seeing an MR question the movement (which wasn't your intention ik but how it came off) could have started a big argument. You shouldn't have said what you did in general and I could have responded in a different way I suppose but I don't appreciate you trying to accuse me of telling you to shut up when that just never happened."


[02-Jun-20 03:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Honestly Slee, the fact that you interpreted that as an attack or something speaks volumes(**yes this is about him)**. Where did I tell you to "shut up and DM an HR"? I clearly remember asking you to either DM an HR or ask us in SL instead of in general discussion bc gd is on a hairpin trigger for drama at all times and seeing an MR question the movement (which wasn't your intention ik but how it came off) could have started a big argument (**again me talking ABOUT ME AND WHAT I ASKED HIM TO DO)**. You shouldn't have said what you did in general and I could have responded in a different way I suppose but I don't appreciate you trying to accuse me of telling you to shut up when that just never happened. (**ME TALKING ABOUT BOTH OF US sure mostly him BUT ALSO ME)**


[02-Jun-20 03:15 PM] xM_inn#2821

[02-Jun-20 03:16 PM] emma;#1525

[02-Jun-20 03:16 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey AM I LYING


[02-Jun-20 03:16 PM] stacey#1000
I mean his inactive thing is done next week so if we decide to fire him over inactivity it‚Äôs fine


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no not really lol


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
slee is jack with grammar which makes it worse


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
like honestly does slee wonder why hes not getting a promo


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
i feel like he thinks he's earned HR back again


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
and he's a head...


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] stacey#1000
But I don‚Äôt think we can fire him for inactivity I‚Äôve seen him go to the hotel and been to his server to ban people


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] bman#0435
he needs to know he doesnt determine what does and doesnt have a consequence lmfao


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
i mean slee has never been to a senior's server


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh my god


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] bman#0435
he straight up wanted emma to be punished


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
slee is trying to use big words


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
to scare me


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
which means he's either NOT going to sessions OR he's going to only HR sessions


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] emma;#1525
which is biased


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
and its actually


[02-Jun-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821

[02-Jun-20 03:18 PM] emma;#1525

[02-Jun-20 03:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think Slee is just here to keep his ‚Äústatus‚Äù

[02-Jun-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
I guess the main question is


[02-Jun-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
his status of being a snowflake?


[02-Jun-20 03:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[02-Jun-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
Slee seems very likely to lose his position for inactivity we will decide on Friday but if we do decide is there anyone that wants to call dibs on firing him or I will

for something she never did


[02-Jun-20 07:46 PM] bman#0435
because slee said in general like "are we seriously bringing this here"


[02-Jun-20 07:46 PM] bman#0435
so emma tagged him in sl and was like


[02-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
if u have a problem tell an hr otherwise ur just trying to start drama


[02-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
and slee went to min saying she said and QUOTED "Shut up and message an HR"


[02-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
so emma messaged slee abt it


[02-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
and said she was painting him as a bad person


[02-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
and then told min saying their dm shouldve been private


[02-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
and then he "gave up"


[02-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
and left his lil stapleton gc with min


[02-Jun-20 07:49 PM] bman#0435

[02-Jun-20 11:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
im speaking with slee now


[02-Jun-20 11:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
He's saying his flag is cause of a relative who's a law enforcement officer is in hospital or died or something and if that's true, I am super sorry for them by all means. But it kind of feels like an excuse, and the timing that he changed his profile picture.. it's almost like he did it purposefully to cause drama. He didn't have to walk in GD as soon as he changed his pfp..


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] bman#0435
he cant do it tomorrow why?


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
exactly


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
today isn't very time appropriate


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
not with everything going on


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
he 100% did it to start drama


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it really wasn't


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
ya


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
why


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
like when was his officer relative hurt


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
its only a day


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
i mean he ignored me for hours!


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] emma;#1525
probably not today


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
so that says  a lot


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
cant he hold his shit for a day


[02-Jun-20 11:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
he's just been in a VERY annoying and immature mood today


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
and it's not acceptable


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
especially considering he's a FORMER HR


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] emma;#1525
its just clear that he thinks he is the moral highroad that we all need to follow


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
get him lost


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
pack him with saab


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
throw them all away


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
kinda off-topic BUT


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] emma;#1525
i mean if we'd posted about blue lives matter he would have been in full support clearly


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
when r we gonna revert the server back


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] bman#0435

[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] bman#0435
i thought blue lives matter meant smurfs


[02-Jun-20 11:40 PM] emma;#1525
but bc it was a movement he doesnt support (clearly, you dont support blue lives matter and black lives matter at the same time... usually...) he made a fuss

[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] emma;#1525
if he's gonna be tone deaf he can deal with the consequences


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] emma;#1525
idc if people support blue lives matter but TODAY of all days, and he totally did it for drama like


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; its also not his fault we did a tribute to black lives matter, you brought controversy, so please dont interfere with the debate


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
people can have opinions


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Tbh I didn‚Äôt even know what blue lives matter was until just now


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
see the problem is


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] emma;#1525
yes but if **other** people that i dont control get mad at him


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] emma;#1525
that's not ME targeting him


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie same


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt say a single thing to him about this


[02-Jun-20 11:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he literally brought this on himself no offense lmao


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
how does he go from


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
change the icon back to


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
he is expressing his views


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
via the pfp


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
if he's gonna be tone deaf that's his choice like im not against supporting cops or anything but i wouldnt do it to literally cause drama today of all days


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
he knew it would cause drama


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
***BLUE LIVES MATTER ICON***


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
and he did it anyways


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
he KNEW what he was doing


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
If he does it again I would just let him deal with it on his own


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
100%


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
If he wants to do that he can do it and deal with it without us helping


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
he literally even said he didnt like bringing politics to discord and then he did it anyways to start drama


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
it doesnt matter guys he can do his own thijng and honor whoever he wants even if it means not being on the right side


[02-Jun-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
like he's such a hypocrite?? and none of us even talked to him about it until HE dmed minn


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
we just had a freakout here about how ridiculous it is lmaooo


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
i respect everybodys opinions


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
he freaked out because he doesnt like drama / politics in bloxton but then (obviously) changes it to a political pfp


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Off topic thing again BUT


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
either way it doesnt matteer


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
i respect everyone's opinions (for the most part) but i wouldn't go shouting "justice for muslims" at a party of 9/11 mourners like


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
that's LOOKING for a fight


[02-Jun-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
which is what slee did


[02-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Notice how there‚Äôs a Father‚Äôs Day and a Mother‚Äôs Day but no day for the kids


[02-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
he probably did it because he didnt like what we did to the server


[02-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
but regardless


[02-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
leave it at that


[02-Jun-20 11:54 PM] bman#0435

[02-Jun-20 11:56 PM] emma;#1525
slee doesnt get honor member bc he's an MR....


[02-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I don‚Äôt rly see y he can‚Äôt have honor member if he technically didn‚Äôt do anything


[02-Jun-20 11:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
slee should still get honor member cause hes still a former hr


[02-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[02-Jun-20 11:56 PM] bman#0435
^


[02-Jun-20 11:56 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think any of his behavior recently has warranted it


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525
he bullied alex


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525

[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll just add a vote on it

[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] xM_inn#2821

[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
but


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wait


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525
he's been immature a lot lately


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
he also is inactive cause hes focusing on stapleton


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
hes still a former hr


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
he gangs up on everyoen with saab


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
When he changed his pfp


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
and is entitled to that role


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Did he go straight to gd


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
he ganged up with saab on alex


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And announce it


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
we cannot decide giving honor from a controversial pfp??


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So everyone saw it?


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
so is jack but he doesnt have honor because of his behavior


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525
he's not entitled to ANYTHING if his behavior doesn't warrant it


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525
he's had bad behavior since we rehired him lmao


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525
i wouldnt want him to have it even without today happening


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] emma;#1525
tbh


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Nono bear I‚Äôm just wondering what he did


[02-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
he doesnt DESERVE anything. he EARNS it. just because he deserved the HR role doesnt mean he earned the honor role


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong?


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
cookie have you seen his behavior these past 3 months


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
^


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
he's been nothing but an asshole who thinks he's superior to all the MRs


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
even before today


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
honor member are for people who 1) were an HR and 2) aren't flaiming, hating, and represent a good role model in Bloxton so if he fits those then he should have it


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wut


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
U mean other than today?


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
he's not a good role model


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
HE'S NOT EVEN ACTIVE


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
he doesnt represent a good role model


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
he hasn't been to a session since 2018 LOL


[02-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Wait what did he do


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
he ganged up on alex


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
activity doesnt matter if your retired idc about that


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
with saab


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O ye Ik that one


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
he's not retired


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
But what else did he do


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
he's literally an MR


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
Emma he‚Äôs likely getting demoted for inactivity on Friday but if so he should still get honour member role back


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
we dont give demoted ppl honor ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but hes inactive now


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; ah ok i understand


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and hes getting killed on friday


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
i thought he was a guest or something


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
he ganged up on other mrs with saab, is self absorbed and only considers the outcome on HIS end, hes caused and has been involved in lots of drama @stacey


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
he literally worked as an LR to get an MR role then proceeded to do absolutely nothing for 3 months


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
that's not honorable


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
to me


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
thats not even most of what he did


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
well there is 7 votes for him to get his honour member role again


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
So


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
he hasnt done a single thing since 2018


[02-Jun-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
i think we should not give it to him and hten let him apply for it 30 days after


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Cooqkie#2809
waiT


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] emma;#1525
like make him wait 30 days


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ima remove mine for a sec


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] emma;#1525
just so he knows we aren't happy with his MR career this time around


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll tell him tomorrow


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] emma;#1525
and then he can 'appeal' and he can get it ig


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Cooqkie#2809
he was a good hr though?


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
Now what if he resigned and didn‚Äôt get demoted for inactivity


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
Couldn‚Äôt he get it then?


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] emma;#1525
i still wouldnt want him to have it


[03-Jun-20 12:00 AM] emma;#1525
again his behavior these past few months has been NOT GOOD AT ALL


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] emma;#1525
how many times have we complained about him?


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Beartikal#9760
ngl not gonna say anything at all but i feel like you guys dont like him and made it personal and thats why u dont wanna give it


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya I get the superior thing


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] emma;#1525
he's not a good role model, he's not active, he's literally criticized everything we've done


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
But


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] emma;#1525
like i did not hate slee at all when he was here last time


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
he acts like an hr and literally tries to force us and other people to do stuff for HIS benefit


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Hmmmm


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and he even made up an announcement


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
for us to fire ppl who make jokes with cancer in it


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
for example, banning people who made corona jokes or talked about cancer


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Omg I was just thinking that Mack


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] xM_inn#2821
i dont like or agree with his actions sometimes, but i still believe he **deserves** honor member for his hard work he put into our group as an HR


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
bruh he made an entire one


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
im shook


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ya shouldn‚Äôt we judge him from when he was an hr?


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
jack put in hard work to this group too


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[03-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
seeing as it‚Äôs a role for former HRs


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] xM_inn#2821
you cant compare slee to jack bman


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
lol we are NOT allying with venti btw


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
sorry that cant happen


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
making up a rule, being inactive, blue lives matter pfp seem like personal problems to me lol


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
even when they get 15k


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal bc you dont have to deal with them


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
on a regular basis


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Bruh tbh idk how jack wasn‚Äôt fired but eh


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
im jealous that you dont see those as issues


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; no we are not allying with venti of course not


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
really


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
truly


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] bman#0435
being inactive isnt a personal problem...?


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I say we give it to him


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] xM_inn#2821
jack did.... questionable things.... meanwhile slee makes some bad decisions that irritate us time to time, but he still deserves the role


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] bman#0435
its half and half


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
We can always take it away if we need to


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt really see why he can‚Äôt get honor member. I get he‚Äôs done stuff that made you all mad with his actions, but if he resigns we can‚Äôt really deny him honor member.


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
venti hired jack and then when he got reported for sexual harassment they said 'we want to give him a fresh start' LOL


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Not like it‚Äôs permanent or something


[03-Jun-20 12:02 AM] emma;#1525
like okay i bet the girls and boys he harassed want one too but they dont get one


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey ngl im with u on this one


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] emma;#1525
the fact that slee is only concerned about his honor member and has no intention of even trying to be active or help us out shows how low we are on his priority list


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
If he gets demoted for inactivity he should still be able to get honor member as well


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey yes


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
Ok he got 7 votes. I‚Äôm telling him he can get honor member


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] ethan;#0003
when are we going to let seniors read tickets


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] Cooqkie#2809
I think we should just give it to him and take it away if we need to it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs glued to him


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
There is no real explanation I can tell him as to why he can‚Äôt


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
you just neeed to announce to them


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] emma;#1525
@ethan; whenever you want


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] emma;#1525
we've already been doing it


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
that they can do tickets


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but they cant count on your ticket thing


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] emma;#1525
ya


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] ethan;#0003
o


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so if u ask them to do, you cant count it as your money


[03-Jun-20 12:03 AM] emma;#1525

[03-Jun-20 12:04 AM] ethan;#0003

[03-Jun-20 12:04 AM] emma;#1525

[03-Jun-20 12:21 AM] xM_inn#2821
idea for v7 (maybe even v6 but i assume it'll be a lot of extra scripting) make it so more than one person can have access to one room, for example if a room owner wanted to invite their friends over, they could be issued a room key as well


[03-Jun-20 12:21 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ooo


[03-Jun-20 12:21 AM] Cooqkie#2809

And have the pineapples spawn in diff spots everyday

I'll check


[03-Jun-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
@emma; omg ban appeals should replace cohosting!!!!!


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yikes this appeal isn't very good at all @emma;


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
ya maybe


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
i never do ban appeals oops


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
ban appeals are technically applications to come back


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
and therefore


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
it isnt a negative


[03-Jun-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525

[03-Jun-20 04:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[03-Jun-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Jun-20 04:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

and she was the only head


[03-Jun-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435
and i asked him y he named addie as sec trainer and not bar


[03-Jun-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435
and he said because lrs cant use cuffs


[03-Jun-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
and i said well she should train her respective rank first and u can do the demo for them


[03-Jun-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jun-20 08:23 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jun-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jun-20 08:31 PM] stacey#1000
I never send a doc directly but I have a doc for myself to copy and paste from


[03-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u should probs ping in hr announcements to see whos guide it is that would make it easier to find out who sent it (if its not super old)


[03-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[03-Jun-20 09:06 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if its in a different disc server can we even do anything


[03-Jun-20 09:06 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
unless its like


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
REALLY major


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's um


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
ya we can lol


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
interesting


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
its my server stort


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
my homestore server


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
and it can still impact him


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
bruh-


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But i dont think it affects?


[03-Jun-20 09:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Im with story that its a different server


[03-Jun-20 09:08 PM] bman#0435
i dont get where yall r getting this "outside servers dont affect him" which they do, and they have in the past. he clearly is making people feel uncomfortable and what he is doing isnt appropriate at all...


[03-Jun-20 09:08 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i mean ya what he did is stupid


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and i see ur point


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but what kinda consequences are u thinking here


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But its minor


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'd definitely stick with at least a 3 day suspension


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] bman#0435
no i didnt say consequence i said just lemme know what u guys think abt it


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
let's think about this real quick


[03-Jun-20 09:09 PM] bman#0435
because ik some people would say nothing since its an outside server


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
out of all the places you could do it in


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
um


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
but some would say something because its inappropriate and making swan uncomfortable


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why your server


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i see both points


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think im sticking with that due to the setting


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
there's a time and a place for things like that and this ain't it


[03-Jun-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
especially if bman advertised this in his status multiple times


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so obviously there's going to be bloxton members


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok but


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well that‚Äôs on bman for putting it on his status


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lol


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
thats not


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
our fault


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if bloxton members join


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so if this wasn‚Äôt Bmans server would y‚Äôall still say a suspension?


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
^


[03-Jun-20 09:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah but we did fire esha for spamming in ava's server


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
though she was cyerbullying


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok well esha and comecala


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
i would


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
things


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
and i dont see how the discord being in my status has an affect on it...?


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
never said it did


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
bloo did


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
neither did i lol


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
"well that‚Äôs on bman for putting it on his status"


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
huh


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what happened


[03-Jun-20 09:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well trey said Bloxton members are in ur server and I said that‚Äôs on you for putting it for all of bloxton to see it lol


[03-Jun-20 09:13 PM] bman#0435
publicity lol


[03-Jun-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think what she essentially did was really out of place and pretty irresponsible


[03-Jun-20 09:13 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok well IMO a suspension is way too harsh, id settle for a warning


[03-Jun-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe im kind of being harsh but that's what i think


[03-Jun-20 09:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll stay with a suspension tbh


[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe we should take a vote and see where it takes us @bman


[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] bman#0435
ye


[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
because we all have done questionable things in other servers and said things at some point even tho it didnt relate to bloxton


[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes was about to say


[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
put a vote


[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Jun-20 09:15 PM] bman#0435
lemme see


[03-Jun-20 09:15 PM] bman#0435
he kinda faded out of it and came to asking if they were doing a shift lol


[03-Jun-20 09:16 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
so he stopped?


[03-Jun-20 09:16 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Then a warn is enough


[03-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
yup


[03-Jun-20 09:16 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok then why would we suspend


[03-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
i put suspend since trey suggested 3 day suspension, it is just an option


[03-Jun-20 09:17 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok well we all agreed woo!


[03-Jun-20 09:17 PM] bman#0435

I'm writing to inform you that as of 05/06/2020 at 02:55 AM BST, you're being issued a written warning at Bloxton Hotels.

Greetings COMECALA,

I'm writing to inform you that as of 05/06/2020 at 02:55 AM BST, you're being issued a written warning at Bloxton Hotels. The High-Rank Team was recently made aware of you making an individual uncomfortable and being disrespectful in a server with many Bloxton members. As an MR, you're expected to remain mature and consider how your actions can have an effect on other people's feelings. Due to the low severity of this incident, we're leaving this as a written warning on your record. We don't usually take action on people who do things outside of servers non-related to Bloxton, but in consideration that this server had a majority of their members from Bloxton, we felt it was appropriate to issue this warning and remind you to be more respectful. If you have any questions or concerns in regards to this written warning, please reply appropriately or contact another member of the High-Rank Team. Thank you.

Signed,

xM_inn
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels

Omg. Sorry about this, I'll think this over and I'll think through my actions going forward. Sorry about this once again. I don't try to hurt anyone, but I do understand how it can be seen from another point of view. Sorry about this, and it will not happen again.

Someone told me that the same managers have been reviewing reports and it gets overflowed more because not all managers review. Anyone else notice this? If so I‚Äôll make an announcement to remind all managers they should be reviewing reports when they can.


[05-Jun-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
who r the same managers


[05-Jun-20 04:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alistelle does a lot of reports, her effort is excellent, she would be a good senior


[05-Jun-20 04:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
I always see her reviewing them


[05-Jun-20 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
She does a lot


[05-Jun-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
ethan said alistelle is host biased and always leaves one server for another


[05-Jun-20 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
There is a good handful of managers that never do reports tho


[05-Jun-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
And I can‚Äôt tell you who does it most of the time but the managers that do it majority of the time find it unfair because it gets overflowed more


[05-Jun-20 04:20 PM] bman#0435
ye it wouldnt hurt. i see sowbex do a lot too tho hes new. he also puts them in the wrong list but hes new!!!!


[05-Jun-20 04:20 PM] stacey#1000

We appreciate your appeal, Novi. However, you made choices you knew were wrong at the time and we do not feel like you want to appeal for the right reasons. Therefore, your appeal has been declined. Multiple HRs agreed.

yeah no

[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman warn her, do not ban


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
shes obviously not 5 years old, if she said she was like 12 years old then thats different


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
but its against discord tos and could lead to the server being deleted by discord...


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
shes not 5 though


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
no 5 year old can use a pc


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
that doesnt matter tho


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] stacey#1000
other people have been banned for joking about it too


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
she is saying shes 5


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
shes not though


[05-Jun-20 07:13 PM] bman#0435
so we have the ability to ban her for that


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] stacey#1000
we shouldnt give her special treatment because she is an honor member


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
then maybe she shouldnt lie about her age in the future


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
just tell her to stop


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
besides, if shes 12 we still have to ban lmfao


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] ethan;#0003
i told the senior who reported her to delete the mssage


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
its 13+


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman im saying that if she said "im 12" then you can ban but she said "im 5"


[05-Jun-20 07:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
nobody can be 5


[05-Jun-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
no thats stupid


[05-Jun-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
you guys are going to win


[05-Jun-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
obviously


[05-Jun-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
im in the minority here


[05-Jun-20 07:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[05-Jun-20 07:15 PM] bman#0435
well im not unsure, weve banned people for it before


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
fine if you want ban her and let her appeal


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just think its stupid


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003
she was banned but then i told the senior who banned her to unban her


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003
she was banned


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003
like 10 minutes ago


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003
and then i said to un ban her


[05-Jun-20 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003
because she didnt know the rule existed


[05-Jun-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
:pensiveclown:


[05-Jun-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
discord enforces things like underaged "8-12" etc


[05-Jun-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
but nobody can be 5 lmaoo


[05-Jun-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats like a baby


[05-Jun-20 07:17 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[05-Jun-20 07:18 PM] ethan;#0003
i think the senior mesaged her


[05-Jun-20 07:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
keep in mind that if somebody that isn't an honor member said "im 5" i would still warn them and not ban
so its not me being biased im just less strict


[05-Jun-20 07:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill let you guys enforce it though


[05-Jun-20 07:19 PM] ethan;#0003
ive seen people get banned for saying they where like 3


[05-Jun-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
also she doesnt know that rule


[05-Jun-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
she has not been on bloxton or been in this server for years


[05-Jun-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
so it makes sense she would mess that rule up


[05-Jun-20 07:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
not surprised tbh


[05-Jun-20 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
it is stated in the rules channel tho


[05-Jun-20 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
so she shouldve read it like everyone else


[05-Jun-20 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
if she didnt, her fault


[05-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
nobody reads the rules


[05-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
just pointing that out


[05-Jun-20 07:21 PM] stacey#1000
well if they dont and they violate it, still their fault


[05-Jun-20 07:21 PM] stacey#1000
its there for a reason and if people want to not read it and get banned for violating one they have themselves to blame


[05-Jun-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
i dont see y were warning people for saying theyre 5 when its so clearly against the discord tos...


[05-Jun-20 07:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
cant tell if they referring to age or rank but im assuming rank

[05-Jun-20 07:51 PM] bman#0435

[05-Jun-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jun-20 07:51 PM] bman#0435
for shifts we need cst and pht B)


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
we really need bst too


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] katie#0200
we‚Äôre good on bst seniors but bst needs a new hr


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] bman#0435
not rly we already have quite a few bst shifts


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] katie#0200

[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
we need est seniors


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh we are hiring over timezones now I thought that was bad


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] bman#0435
ya no shift nominees r est


[05-Jun-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
no bst seniors needed unless anna is promoted


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
i never said it was bad


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^^


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] bman#0435
timezones were always a consideration...


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Used to be


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Recently not


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
we agreed on anna and candy.. why are we changing it again now?


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
ive always looked at activity, timezone, maturity, etc


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
because things change in a month


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
why is quwanterz suddenly in the picture when anna has been here longer and has way more qualities?


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
and not everyones opinions stay the same all the time


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] bman#0435
because hes also a good candidate


[05-Jun-20 07:53 PM] bman#0435
lol


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003
because quwanterz is super active for his odd timezone


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
y'all promised and compromised to vote on anna and candy when we have a shift vote in a month


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
lol okay


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
no what we agreed to was 2 shifts or none


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
I do like quw and I think he'd benefit the SEA timezone but Anna is more deserving. I would of course consider quw next time


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
^


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] katie#0200
i agree with bonnie


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
I vote anna for sure


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
quwanterz is more deserving in my opinion


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Quw would be my 3rd vote but I only have one vote


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I don‚Äôt mean to sound rude but we did agree Anna and candy-


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
I also agree that one vote each for the shift vote.


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003
quwan and anna


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003
are my votes


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
candy and quwanterz


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
if i get one vote


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Guess what


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
i vote anna


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
ethan u said candy and quwanterz literally not even 4 mins ago


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ur only getting one vote


[05-Jun-20 07:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I guess there minds have changed stort ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
So choose wisely


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bman#0435
what if 2 tie?


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
we had a huge fight before because we didn‚Äôt know WHICH one to pick. I‚Äôm sorry but Anna or candy or like just cancel this because I don‚Äôt wanna fight over this again


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bman#0435
like 1 is in the lead but the other 2 tie


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@Bloo_Berriez ugh bloo):


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
We're hiring 2 shifts @bman


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
Then I'll change my vote


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
But ur only getting 1 vote


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bman#0435
ya ik that but im asking what if theres a tie between 2 and the third is in a major lead...


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
Or we'll put it to 2 votes


[05-Jun-20 07:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
OH


[05-Jun-20 07:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
If its a tie and all hrs vote then we do 2 votes each


[05-Jun-20 07:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
@xAfroTrey .............


[05-Jun-20 07:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
:grr: WHY


[05-Jun-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jun-20 07:56 PM] xM_inn#2821

[05-Jun-20 07:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
2 bc we probs wont have a great divide for senior


[05-Jun-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
literally just look at shift logs and session logs and look at mayas activity


[05-Jun-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
you cant comment you dont see her if u havent even looked at that


[05-Jun-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
she cant attend every session but legit she is always at later sessions i host and we need hosts for the later est sessions


[05-Jun-20 07:59 PM] katie#0200
true ill look at that when im on my computer


[05-Jun-20 07:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
stacey


[05-Jun-20 07:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[05-Jun-20 07:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
<:


[05-Jun-20 08:00 PM] bman#0435
ive only seen mayas name appear once on both cards combined within the past 2 days. from what i see, alistelle is more active at the hotel and sarah at sessions


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
so she does stuff everyday or close to everyday, thats active to me


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
alistelle curses too much


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
@xAfroTrey ik üò¢


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] katie#0200
lol


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
maya goes to my sessions almost everday


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
ethan u just said u wanted her for senior-


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
maya has never gone to my sessions


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
So everyone agrees on one vote for the shift vote? Fantastic we can have a nice normal stress free vote


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
becus u dont host good times


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thought you were all gonna object


[05-Jun-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
bman im just saying just because she doesnt always go to your sessions doesnt mean she is not active


[05-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
stacey said she goes to later sessions and said 7 pm est. i host 8 ans 9. pretty sure those r times she wpuld attend at


[05-Jun-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
she attended ethans like 12am sessions


[05-Jun-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
or 1am sessions


[05-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
i mever said she isnt active but i scrolled through the session and shift cards and only seen her username 1 time on each card combined


[05-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
all im saying is i never see her


[05-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
that doesnt mean she isnt active


[05-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who are nominees for senior


[05-Jun-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[05-Jun-20 08:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
idk about my second choice for sure tho


[05-Jun-20 08:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
im still deciding


[05-Jun-20 08:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I might pick Drxzzle and Jelly


[05-Jun-20 08:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
see, i like alistelle since she has a strong passion for reports, however she also has a lot of flaws so I don't think she's quite ready


[05-Jun-20 08:07 PM] katie#0200
what are her flaws


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
apparently she's immature


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
i'll have to check back


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
but some hrs mentioned yesterday i think


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
or earlier today


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] katie#0200
oh


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] bman#0435
alistelle is host biased and leaves servers when not asked, throwing that out there


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh yes, that's what ethan said ^


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] bman#0435
and apparently curses way too often


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] katie#0200
I mean


[05-Jun-20 08:08 PM] katie#0200

trey's a shift manager and swears more though so as long as she is swearing appropriately and only where she should, i dont think it needs to be held against her


[05-Jun-20 08:10 PM] bman#0435
SHE CURSED MORE THAN TREY?


[05-Jun-20 08:10 PM] xM_inn#2821

we don‚Äôt rlly have a valid reason to demote him right now if he‚Äôs still doing stuff i get it‚Äôs not the most beneficial thing but it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre trying to rid all the mrs that aren‚Äôt perfect because we need more mrs anyway

REVIEWING REPORTS REMINDER

Greetings, Managers.


Recently, there has been an increased amount of reports being sent in. With hitting a million members, the hotel activity has increased a lot. This is a positive for the group as a whole, but this also means a lot more reports being sent in is to be expected. With more reports being sent in, there has been times there has been an overflow of reports, as there is a bit of an overflow right now.

I would like to kindly remind all of you that you should be reviewing reports when you are available to. As a manager, reviewing reports is a big part of your position. It can take some time, but as long as you are all reviewing reports when you can there won‚Äôt be too much of an overflow. Remember, you are all part of a team and it is unfair to those that review reports often due to the overflow to not be reviewing reports and helping out when you can. The HR team does take notice of those that review reports.  If you are ever unsure about a report, you can always ask an HR or another manager their opinion on it.

Remember we are a team here. I hope you all have a good rest of your day/night and if you have any questions or concerns feel free to message any member of the HR team.

[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
@bman shes usually either doing vocal lessons, eating, or just not on at that time idk that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve noticed


[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
She is my first pick


[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435
im for drizzle and emmy :3


[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
Bman none of them are in est timezone


[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435
ok


[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jun-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
They are active


[06-Jun-20 03:21 PM] bman#0435
other timezones can also help in est sessions


[06-Jun-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
But what I‚Äôm saying is if they were both promoted est sessions would still never get enough hosts


[06-Jun-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
Uh no I never see Emmy it drxzzle at my sessions


[06-Jun-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
7pm is like 1am bst


[06-Jun-20 03:21 PM] bman#0435
we dont need est seniors jsut for est sessions...


[06-Jun-20 03:21 PM] bman#0435
we can have a senior from across the world and still host est sessions


[06-Jun-20 03:22 PM] bman#0435
i dont see y we need to have both new seniors est seniors when other timezones have no issue hosting for est sessions as well


[06-Jun-20 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
I may vote drxzzle and jxlly


[06-Jun-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Jun-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Jun-20 03:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[06-Jun-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jun-20 07:44 PM] bman#0435
all we need is the passers and mrs and if they left or not-


[06-Jun-20 07:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean it‚Äôs really their choice if they wanna make it fancy or not lol


[06-Jun-20 07:46 PM] bman#0435
but then it makes it complicated on our ends when we copy and paste the names into the group admin


[06-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wdym


[06-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
you just double click the name


[06-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
all we need is the passers, mrs, and notices. they add so much extra text to make it bold, square, bulleted, etc that its harder to copy and paste thew names

[06-Jun-20 07:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don‚Äôt really have an issue, I just double click the passers names and it selects it for me


[06-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
no one is gonna see their fancy stuff


[06-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jun-20 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
yeah I tried saying that before


[06-Jun-20 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
he said he was suppose to be back in May


[06-Jun-20 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
but hes not


[06-Jun-20 08:17 PM] stacey#1000
hes been inactive for months


[06-Jun-20 08:18 PM] bman#0435
nowits june 30th


[06-Jun-20 08:18 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[06-Jun-20 08:18 PM] bman#0435
funny how after he was accused of being a cb


[06-Jun-20 08:18 PM] bman#0435
he magically went inactive


[06-Jun-20 08:18 PM] stacey#1000
ive seen him on other games too I think


[06-Jun-20 08:19 PM] bman#0435
he was last online a month ago


[06-Jun-20 08:19 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[06-Jun-20 08:19 PM] stacey#1000
well hes on discord a lot


[06-Jun-20 08:19 PM] bman#0435
ya so he has no excuse


[06-Jun-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
I think if he changes his inactive notice again to the end of july we should add an inactive thing for him


[06-Jun-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435
i mean its been up since jan-may and extended to june


[06-Jun-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[06-Jun-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435
i think we should maybe get other opinions because we should take care of it now


[06-Jun-20 08:21 PM] bman#0435
considering we also are in need of more active seniors


[06-Jun-20 08:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well if he hasn‚Äôt been on Roblox in a month what could we do. I mean he could have discord on his phone? and depends what phone he has cause not all phones are capable of running Roblox well


[06-Jun-20 08:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I agree with Stacey that if it gets extended again then we talk to him and see what‚Äôs going on


[06-Jun-20 08:37 PM] bman#0435

why wouldnt u be bothered


[06-Jun-20 11:04 PM] bman#0435

u legit said


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u were fine with her leaking as long as it stayed in their dms


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
leaking is leaking... periodt


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] ¬¢. ·É¶#0666
ya :/


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
can I just say we shouldnt asume anna is going to leak to emily just because they are close friends


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
if it was reported then of course i would agree to fire her...


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
yall fired matt for leaking but im sure it stayed in cinders dms ü§©


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
you misunderstood my point. im not supporting leaking AT ALL.


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] Cooqkie#2809
omg min no


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] stacey#1000
look at me for example, im really close friends with megan and i hve never, nor would I ever leak anything to her


[06-Jun-20 11:05 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
u said u wouldnt be bothered


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
well stacey


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] stacey#1000
and i told her myself if i ever did leak anything to her for her to report me


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
basically minns saying if we never found out


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
ur not attached to the hip with megan being inseparable


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so we can‚Äôt do much


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
excuse my bad wording.


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If we don‚Äôt know


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
u can spend a day without megan


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes bloo.


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] stacey#1000
oh ive spent over a month without megan lol


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
IM NOT SUPPORTING LEAKING AT ALL just to clarify


[06-Jun-20 11:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[06-Jun-20 11:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
u said that-


[06-Jun-20 11:07 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ya if we never found out, but leaking is still leaking, and leaking is a threat either way so


[06-Jun-20 11:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
also @a. ·É¶ it was basically just about the black lives matter announcement we made. I never saw it until she mentioned it... OOPS


[06-Jun-20 11:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
cookie, i literally explained my point.


[06-Jun-20 11:07 PM] xM_inn#2821

[06-Jun-20 11:07 PM] bman#0435

oh my god, y'all are literally not understanding what im trying to say and im not sure how im supposed to explain what im trying to say any simpler.

that


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if we don‚Äôt know that she is leaking to emily like say we DIDNT know


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
of course i dont want people leaking and i dont support people leaking. leaking = fire - solid. now listen to bloo so he can explain what im struggling to explain.


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
then there‚Äôs nothing we can do


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
UNLESS


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it was reported


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
then def action would be taken


[06-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
(: there we all understand? GREAT


[06-Jun-20 11:10 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[06-Jun-20 11:10 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

Who wants coffee but read the description (Headphone Warning)
Who wants coffee but Vic gets distorted and his voice pitch up by a half of a semitone* when he questions people: "Who wants coffee?" (Also counts with: "Does anybody want coffee?")

oh


[07-Jun-20 01:52 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ur not mermaid material


[07-Jun-20 01:58 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yes @xAfroTrey i have several issues


[07-Jun-20 02:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
@High Rank Can we adjust training policy. Join servers Early, kick Excess Staff first, THEN wait for REAL trainees.

Right now its, 50 staff wait early, 5 real trainees appear, then you literally waste space and kick 45 staff where there would have been so much more trainees??


[07-Jun-20 02:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
we're not using resources good enough


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] stacey#1000
we shouldnt kick staff because a lot of them re-train


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] stacey#1000
and thats why some of them can wait there early


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
then ask if anybody is retraining if not kick instantly who arent selected


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
why are we kicking 40 staff when the server is slocked - thats just a waste of room


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] stacey#1000
and if we wait for trainees to join and then there is no staff there to help we wont have enough staff


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
get 5 staff


[07-Jun-20 02:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
kick the rest


[07-Jun-20 02:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
?


[07-Jun-20 02:26 AM] stacey#1000
idk how that would work it sounds confusing


[07-Jun-20 02:26 AM] stacey#1000
and how early would you want us to wait on training servers


[07-Jun-20 02:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
the only thing confusing right now is wasting 40 player slots on people who could actually train


[07-Jun-20 02:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
im unsure


[07-Jun-20 02:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
you guys would have to Experiment with Time


[07-Jun-20 02:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
i just dont really like how it works right now


[07-Jun-20 02:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
surely you guys can agree it is a waste of space if 40 trainees appear


[07-Jun-20 02:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
and only 7 are used/ training


[07-Jun-20 02:28 AM] stacey#1000
majority of the time I go on a server and there is usually over 10 trainees already


[07-Jun-20 02:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
how about this:


[07-Jun-20 02:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
how about i introduce a new system: "Request" to "Help" with Training button.
Once all the requests are full, new staff that join are kicked or possibly redirected to next server.


[07-Jun-20 02:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
(of course i will take into account staff that want to retrain)


[07-Jun-20 02:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
does this sound good or bad


[07-Jun-20 02:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
it sounds not only useful but also clears up room


[07-Jun-20 02:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can make it attached to commands 
"!sethelpers Receptionist 5"
or whatever you guys want


[07-Jun-20 02:29 AM] stacey#1000
would another solution be to increase the player count to like 55 or 60 players or is that too much lag?


[07-Jun-20 02:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
if i do that then thats "5" more room for staff to join


[07-Jun-20 02:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
thats not a solution


[07-Jun-20 02:30 AM] stacey#1000
also more room for trainees not just staff


[07-Jun-20 02:30 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
sigh we just have a big groupüò≠üò≠


[07-Jun-20 02:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
thats why its time to make big boy changes


[07-Jun-20 02:31 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I mean I see your point


[07-Jun-20 02:31 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
But I‚Äôm trying to think of a good way to change it


[07-Jun-20 02:31 AM] stacey#1000
can we have a max of like 15 trainees per server then


[07-Jun-20 02:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
i mean the solution i said doesnt sound too bad


[07-Jun-20 02:31 AM] stacey#1000
because then we need 15 helpers, etc and then managers, heads, etc


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can allow flexibility so you guys can use commands to set helper limits


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] stacey#1000
it is possible to get too many trainees per server too


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] stacey#1000
so if we want a limit on staff can we get a limit on trainees too


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
sure


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
if we name helpers ourselves what are managers gonna do-


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
managers will not be kicked with the system then?


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
you can kick them manually if somehow they appear all at once


[07-Jun-20 02:32 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I‚Äôm so lost


[07-Jun-20 02:33 AM] stacey#1000
is it also possible to allow managers to have mod when they join like seniros


[07-Jun-20 02:33 AM] stacey#1000
seniors*


[07-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
because we just have to mod them anyway


[07-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
and say if i cant get into a server i need to get into to host, i can have a manager kick staff for me to get in


[07-Jun-20 02:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
```
Staff joins Training - if Staff is NOT there to Re-Train, helper limit is checked. if helper limit is already max, that staff is not needed and is kicked or redirected.

if there is space for this staff, that staff is counted as a "Helper"

There will be commands to set "limits" on Helpers and Trainees.
```


[07-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
that would help greatly if managers got mod like seniors did when joining training


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
does it sound


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
do-able


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
yes but is the thing i suggested possible as well for managers


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
it actually would also save time from us having to go to second servers to mod them


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
and get the main server started faster


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Is there gonna be a retrain option


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
that is definitely possible stacey


[07-Jun-20 02:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ·É¶ yes


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
if they pres "retrain" they are counted as a "Trainee"


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] stacey#1000
i would love not having to go mod second servers anymore and just dm seniors to start at the start time instead


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
how about i make it even better


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
you can use !Start to initiate the training on ALL servers


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
this will pop up a notification on ALL servers at the top of the screen to "Start"


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
hows that?


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Cam#5887
that


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] stacey#1000
tbh why havent managers already gotten mod at trainings automatically already like seniors if we have to mod them anyways


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Cam#5887
sounds


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
now you dont even have to DM them


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] Cam#5887
sick


[07-Jun-20 02:36 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
so advanced üòñ


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] Cam#5887
that legit sounds so cool


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
advanced is good üôÇ


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I‚Äôm so oldschool BAHAHAH


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] Cam#5887
tho i will miss having a full server to have fun with


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] Cam#5887
this will be beneficial


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] stacey#1000
can we also make it that managers get mod at interviews automatically too, not heads tho we can still mod heads at interviews


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
we're on a mission to modernize and make YOUR job much EASIER.
i hate how you guys have to do all this work for training, interviews. We are a BIG group, our old practices should be modernized.


[07-Jun-20 02:37 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
modding people at ints is so frustrating


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ·É¶ thats fixable as well


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] stacey#1000
i will be so happy when i dont have to leave my own server to mod secondary servers anymore


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
There‚Äôs always an impersonator


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
yes


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
üòñ


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I MEAN I rarely host but like


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] stacey#1000
thats the most annoying thing because sometimes i cant even get into my own server


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
one of them did kick all for my ints one day :(


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
right stacey


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] Beartikal#9760
ill work on these new stuff once i plow through some current projects i have to do first


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] Beartikal#9760
just suggesting it


[07-Jun-20 02:38 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Omg cam):


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I should host


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
tomorrow


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
first time in forever ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
same i should probably host


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
i only hosted 2 sessions this week


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
**only**


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
and that makes me upset


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] Beartikal#9760
2 days ago I attended a training session and trained to get a job, I sat around with 30 Staff and 3 trainees for 2 hours EARLY. I made conversation with staff and they said "i sometime wait here 6 hours!" which made me really freak out!!


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I haven‚Äôt hosted since like April üòÇüòÇ


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
yeah some of the staff


[07-Jun-20 02:39 AM] stacey#1000
yeah idk why some people wait for even an hour


[07-Jun-20 02:40 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
cause staff wait long for no reason


[07-Jun-20 02:40 AM] Cam#5887
hmmm, suggestion bear


[07-Jun-20 02:40 AM] Cam#5887
maybe move the training schedule from the FAQ board and put it in front of the seating area ?


[07-Jun-20 02:40 AM] stacey#1000
i usually go 30 mins early


[07-Jun-20 02:40 AM] stacey#1000
because im not waiting for an hour to start a session


[07-Jun-20 02:40 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I go like 10 minutes early


[07-Jun-20 02:41 AM] Cam#5887
i pend whenever my interviews are done


[07-Jun-20 02:41 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I just don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs gonna work


[07-Jun-20 02:41 AM] Cam#5887
since i always do interviews beofre my sessions


[07-Jun-20 02:41 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
And I‚Äôm scared staff will hate the idea


[07-Jun-20 02:41 AM] Cam#5887
well training is a place to cool off at and to have a good time


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] Cam#5887
it gets players away from trollers and exploiters


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
change must be made im sick of worrying whether or not they will be scared for the change. we're too old, even sizzleburger has better training regimen then we do, i will confirm the change with some MRs and get feedback, and will work to modernize old practices


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Bear how would themed sessions work?


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
what do you mean @a. ·É¶


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
oh


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
so


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
you decorate but how does that interfere with what im planning to add


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] stacey#1000
yes im also excited for the new interview and application questions


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Some hrs do themed sessions where we


[07-Jun-20 02:42 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Don‚Äôt kick staff


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] Cam#5887
yes so they can have fun


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
its fully customizable, the syste mcan set limits or even be shut off temporarily by you guys


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] Cam#5887
oooooo


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] stacey#1000
i dont host theme sessions a lot it takes forever to prepare for it


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] Cam#5887
i like that


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] Cam#5887
so like, we can control all servers with the GUI?


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok sorry  I don‚Äôt script üôÑ


[07-Jun-20 02:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
chat commands im thinking @Cam


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Cam#5887
ahhh


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Cam#5887
much better


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ·É¶ wel obviously but of course it can be done


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] stacey#1000
what if a server ends up not being hosted


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Cam#5887
what ever happened to the old slock sound ü§î


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
true


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey what do you mean


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I forget the old slock sound omg


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
"ba-DING"


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] stacey#1000
like a server needs a senior to get hosted right


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
wow bear I just heard it.. thx


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] stacey#1000
sometimes we dont have enough seniors to host


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
üôÑ


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] Cam#5887
LOL


[07-Jun-20 02:44 AM] stacey#1000
like yesterday I had 3 servers not hosted


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887
damn


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887
sorry to hear


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887

[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
SPAM


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] stacey#1000
I tagged all HRs to see if they wanted to host


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Beartikal#9760
i mean if its important i can make it so that servers without the appropriate limit of Seniors warn players at the top of the screen that that server MIGHT not get hosted


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I don‚Äôt read messages in here often üò≠üò≠


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887
BEAR I HAVE A SUGGESTIONNNNN


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Beartikal#9760
furthermore i can add !close which closes all other servers without an appropriate Senior limit?


[07-Jun-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887
could u make a Warn command?


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
like


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
for the hotel?


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
etc?


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
yes yes


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
of course


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
oooo


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can also add logs for it too


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
that would be nice


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
cause then it would all be logged down


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
and easier for MRs to kick


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
and such


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
im going to add a lot of logs like i said yeah


[07-Jun-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
and also


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Beartikal#9760
advanced chat logs too :hearteyesclown:


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Cam#5887
for that !close command


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Cam#5887
so that will close all servers?


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Beartikal#9760
it doesnt have ot be named close that was just an idea


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Why would we close all servers


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Cam#5887
but what if one server is done before another?


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Cam#5887
would we have to wait?


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
servers finish at different times


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] stacey#1000
so like say if 5 mins after the session starts if there is no senior on it to host can you make a message thing saying the server wont be hosted


[07-Jun-20 02:47 AM] Beartikal#9760
its when a server doesnt have an appropriate Senior limit, i can make it go to all the other servers and check


[07-Jun-20 02:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
that what !close is for


[07-Jun-20 02:48 AM] Cam#5887
o that makes sense


[07-Jun-20 02:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
its Not a shutdown, it basically checks ALL servers and closes the ones without seniors


[07-Jun-20 02:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
its a massShutdown


[07-Jun-20 02:48 AM] stacey#1000

or very small groups with big egos


[07-Jun-20 09:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
and baby mentioned a few weeks ago he isnt really looking for anymore alliances


[07-Jun-20 09:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
so i think we should keep it maybe just high-rank research only

@xAfroTrey


[07-Jun-20 09:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
who came up with the rule of


[07-Jun-20 09:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
"you cant wear that - it covers the uniform"


[07-Jun-20 09:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats a bad rule please remove it


[07-Jun-20 09:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
there is a rank indicator above the head theres no need to restrict avatars


[07-Jun-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
we made that a rule before the rank thing lol


[07-Jun-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
and the uniform should still be visible


[07-Jun-20 09:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats dumb why are we forcing users to change their outfit


[07-Jun-20 09:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats like a restriction of freedom


[07-Jun-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
its just if theyre at the hotel


[07-Jun-20 09:35 PM] bman#0435
lol


[07-Jun-20 09:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
but why


[07-Jun-20 09:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
the rank is shown above the head just let them wear what thye want to


[07-Jun-20 09:36 PM] bman#0435
because uniforms are required at the hotel


[07-Jun-20 09:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
it makes no sense


[07-Jun-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
then make it not a rule


[07-Jun-20 09:37 PM] bman#0435
werent u the ones that made the uniforms are required rule-


[07-Jun-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
so they dont get called out üôÇ


[07-Jun-20 09:37 PM] bman#0435
uniforms should still be visible at the hotel no matter what


[07-Jun-20 09:37 PM] bman#0435
if u dont want people changing their avatars then script something that goes over rhtro


[07-Jun-20 09:38 PM] bman#0435
otherwise, uniforms should be visible


[07-Jun-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its a hat that covers the uniform that shouldnt matter


[07-Jun-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
let them express themselves


[07-Jun-20 09:38 PM] bman#0435
hats cant cover uniforms-


[07-Jun-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
let me show you:


[07-Jun-20 09:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
but theres no reason to make them though


[07-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
we just ask to make their torso visible with the uniform since it has the logo


[07-Jun-20 09:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just dont see that as a rule


[07-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
thats all we ask from them with the uniform


[07-Jun-20 09:40 PM] bman#0435
if u dont think that should be a rule then neither should uniforms at the hotel be required

since thye are palying the game


[07-Jun-20 09:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they shouldnt be allowed to wear the uniform on break


[07-Jun-20 09:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc theyre on break


[07-Jun-20 09:43 PM] bman#0435
but for now uniforms r required so they shouldnt have to express themselves as a dinosaur


[07-Jun-20 09:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok then ill automatically remove it


[07-Jun-20 09:44 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
they sent a good app


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] bman#0435
bear said we not allying with them


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
doesnt mean we're allying with them


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] bman#0435
they were hacked 2 months aog

ik


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
they're only on that list cause they sent a good app


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
this is where u now put ur comments


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
and tell me to decline it


[07-Jun-20 09:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
which is what i was planning on doing anyway


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
so poor andy spent his time writing an app for a group we're not allying with


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmm idk


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
but aside from the jack stuff


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
they have a small group


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
were recently hacked


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
and other things


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
OH


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Their owner is gullible af


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
and bear doesnt want them as an alliance


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye cant u just tell them


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
so that means decline ‚ùå


[07-Jun-20 09:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
well


[07-Jun-20 09:51 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
The co owner doesnt want to ally with u


[07-Jun-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
there's no good reason to decline their app cause its detailed


[07-Jun-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
but


[07-Jun-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
there's very strong reasoning to decline the alliance itself


[07-Jun-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
which is why im waiting a week


[07-Jun-20 09:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
- Low member count

- Group recently hacked

- Co-Founder does not wish to proceed with alliance.


[07-Jun-20 09:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
and anything else


[07-Jun-20 09:52 PM] xM_inn#2821

ye im not sure whether i wanna add the jack part though


[07-Jun-20 09:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause like


[07-Jun-20 09:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
they could argue we're not allied and stuff


[07-Jun-20 09:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
although anyone with a good mind would fire  him


[07-Jun-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
u dont have to be allied to deal with sexual harassment,...?


[07-Jun-20 09:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[07-Jun-20 09:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[07-Jun-20 10:04 PM] bman#0435
they literally ignore our reports...


[07-Jun-20 10:04 PM] bman#0435
ya but it doesnt mean we cant report people for sexual harassment!


[07-Jun-20 10:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
although the sexual harassment and the reporting thing and whatever happened with soccer is a negative, lets also try to focus on other negatives which can be used in the official decline letter


[07-Jun-20 10:05 PM] xM_inn#2821

what would happen if instead of warning trollers we play along with it or ignore them


[07-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
ive always wondered that


[07-Jun-20 11:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
personally I think they would get bored and leave


[07-Jun-20 11:09 PM] bman#0435
then it encourages trolling and we would be seen as immature and unprofessional


[07-Jun-20 11:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
I'm not so sure.


[07-Jun-20 11:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
trollers love getting warned


[07-Jun-20 11:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they cant have that


[07-Jun-20 11:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
then... they just sit there..


[07-Jun-20 11:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[07-Jun-20 11:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
also by whose eyes


[07-Jun-20 11:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
do you mean


[07-Jun-20 11:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
being "seen" as immature and unprofessional


[07-Jun-20 11:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
you guys were lecturing us about being more professional weekz ago !  üëÄ


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
no no of course


[07-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats important


[07-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
you guys are HRs


[07-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
i care more about you guys' actions


[07-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
you guys are like faces of Bloxton in a way


[07-Jun-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
I mean yeah trollers do want attention but we dont want them ruining people's rp experience by trolling either


[07-Jun-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
we could possibly change the warning system a bit


[07-Jun-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
maybe less then 3 warnings?


[07-Jun-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
just an idea


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
stacey its not the amount


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
i think its the idea of getting a warning


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
Trollers like to use the words "lit" "hoi", etc.


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
their grammar is more down-to-earth


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
Our staff maintain professional face


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
Their goal is to make them crack


[07-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
trigger them


[07-Jun-20 11:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
they love how they MUST maintain a professional face so they use that to have "fun"


[07-Jun-20 11:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
What if:


[07-Jun-20 11:25 PM] stacey#1000
@xAfroTrey


[07-Jun-20 11:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
```
Troller: hi can i have an infinity gauntlet
Staff: Please order off the menu
Troller: i just want a gauntlet
Staff: Please stop trolling.
Troller: lol make me
....
escalates to a kick, results in them rejoining, having a laugh

what if..

Troller: hi can i have an infinity gauntlet
Staff: Hmm, i'll ahve to check if we have any in the back.
Troller: oh, ok.
Staff: -checks- 
Staff: Yeah we have none right now, sorry.
Troller: Oh ok.
```


[07-Jun-20 11:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
The difference is clear


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
what if we "play" along


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] bman#0435
so u want us to troll the troller-


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
Yes.


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
Propfessionally.


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] bman#0435
ya no thanks


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] bman#0435
trolling aint professional in any sort


[07-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
We won't have as much trollers.


[07-Jun-20 11:28 PM] bman#0435
it would encourage them to keep coming back


[07-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
Ok, how about this:


[07-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I don‚Äôt like the idea of ‚Äúplaying along‚Äù


[07-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
what if you just ignore them


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
but it does


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] bman#0435
if u ignore them then they dont get warned


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman they get bored --> they leave


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] stacey#1000
well if say a troller is in the reception lane blocking others it can be hard to ignore them


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] bman#0435
i assume u havent met our hotels trollers-


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
no i've met plenty


[07-Jun-20 11:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
it doesnt take a rocket science to understand trollers


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435
ya they dont leave just cuz 1 person ignores them


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if we ignore them then I can guarantee you they‚Äôre gonna call their trolling buddies and they gonna have the whole squad come and ruin people‚Äôs experience at the hotel


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435
we literally ignore cbs and they keep coming back


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] stacey#1000

[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
have you seen the servers without staff? Please go and count how many trollers there are in those servers.


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
They go BECAUSE the staff are there.


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435
cant rly do anything about that...


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435
lol


[07-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
If the staff ignore them, the problem is solved.


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] stacey#1000
yes just like cbs go there because there is an mr or hr there


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] stacey#1000
it would be hard for staff to ignore them tho


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] stacey#1000
like if they are trolling in the receptionist lane


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
The trollers hate you guys, right


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
?


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] bman#0435
üòç


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] stacey#1000
they join more for being kicked or banned not being warned


[07-Jun-20 11:31 PM] stacey#1000
so they commit offences to get kicked or banned because some people find it fun I guess


[07-Jun-20 11:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
One time I refused to ban them, started playing music on the radio, dancing, they danced along.
They stopped cursing, stopped hating me, and starting chanting "bear is the best".


[07-Jun-20 11:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
I think I know what i mean..


[07-Jun-20 11:32 PM] bman#0435
if we refuse they just spam BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME


[07-Jun-20 11:32 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[07-Jun-20 11:32 PM] stacey#1000
we tried refusing to ban cbs before


[07-Jun-20 11:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if you have a troller interfering with a staff member and a guest at the hotel trying to say get a room, and you have that troller there being annoying while that staff members tries to conversant with the hotel guest and ignore it, it‚Äôs gonna get annoying


[07-Jun-20 11:33 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[07-Jun-20 11:34 PM] Beartikal#9760

thats what I was trying to suggest before, changing the warning system instead


[07-Jun-20 11:34 PM] bman#0435
that warning is called a ban


[07-Jun-20 11:34 PM] bman#0435
he reported someone that wasnt using grammar


[07-Jun-20 11:34 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jun-20 11:34 PM] bman#0435
the missing punctuation?


[07-Jun-20 11:34 PM] stacey#1000
that would be something that is just a warning


[07-Jun-20 11:35 PM] stacey#1000
nothing major


[07-Jun-20 11:35 PM] bman#0435
^


[07-Jun-20 11:35 PM] bman#0435
minor


[07-Jun-20 11:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
"your" instead of you're.. sriously?


[07-Jun-20 11:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
Let me remind you to capitalize the first word of each sentence. üôÇ


[07-Jun-20 11:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
He was on a tangent


[07-Jun-20 11:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
He wasnt done.


[07-Jun-20 11:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
Im just sick of reports like this.


[07-Jun-20 11:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
The problem is they are.


[07-Jun-20 11:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
no theyre not


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
we just said its a warning


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
lol


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] stacey#1000
not for minor lack of grammar


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] stacey#1000
its a warning that doesnt mean much


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] stacey#1000
they only get suspended for major lack of grammar


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] stacey#1000
not minor like that


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
bear that lowkey concerns me that u think every report we get is an automatic suspension and that u dont trust us in making the right decisions


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
im going to search through trello and discord and you'd better be right about that


[07-Jun-20 11:37 PM] bman#0435
ur being so picky over such minor recently


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] bman#0435
first its using tts, now its uniforms, now its reports


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] bman#0435
and u said u trust us since we, in a way, r the faces of bloxton


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
I'm changing things, change is good./


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] bman#0435
but u dont  trust our decisions


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
Its not that


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
I dont like some rules


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
Im ready to change some.


[07-Jun-20 11:38 PM] bman#0435

Right now it's not working when 40 staff wait before hand.


[07-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Beartikal#9760

[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
he wants to make a system where


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
LRs can request to help


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
ig


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
and then there wont be excess


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
am i wrong, bear?


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] bman#0435
request to help...?


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
or is this something else?


[07-Jun-20 11:41 PM] bman#0435
thats the point of them joining the tc...?


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
Let me put the entire draft here


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
ye


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
it was long


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] bman#0435
u better also tell us the rest of the fixes u plan to do before the new shift managers come into chaos


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] bman#0435
its called to random


[07-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
:to random


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
or were u considering


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] bman#0435
LOL


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
an actual custom command?


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
like for MRs specifically?


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
ooooooooo


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
OH YEAH bear wants to do a thing


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
he said


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] bman#0435
wouldnt the heads just train whatever their position is designated to...?


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
well, bear was talking about a !start command


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
which would start all servers in a training


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
i thought that was pretty damn cool


[07-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
no cap


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
ya but the point of them being the highest rank of their previous one is to practically oversee their lr position


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
then whats the point of modding


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
lol


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Cam#5887
bruh


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Cam#5887
how do u change a card color


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Cam#5887
that sounds c00l


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
no i mean


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
whats the point of the !start command if we still have to mod


[07-Jun-20 11:44 PM] bman#0435
lol


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] bman#0435
yes what


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
idk we may not have to mod


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] bman#0435
that was a question


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
im aware


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] bman#0435
so then how will managers get mod.,..?


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think cause someone suggested giving mod to managers @bman


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
exactly


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
At trainings


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
what bloo said


[07-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
with the script


[07-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Cam#5887
the BAE script


[07-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So we wouldn‚Äôt have to go mod anymore


[07-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Cam#5887

[07-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Cam#5887

[07-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Cam#5887
hm


[07-Jun-20 11:52 PM] bman#0435
sorry bear but i gotta disagree. the changing the helpers just seems so excessive if we have to constantly do it every time a trainee joins. i also dont think we can get "the perfect amount of helpers"


[07-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Cam#5887
yeah im not a huge fan of getting rid of excess before the session starts


[07-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Cam#5887
cause like


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Cam#5887
i feel as if training is one of the points of their occupation to give them time to breathe


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] bman#0435
when me and trey had the same idea


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] bman#0435
üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Cam#5887
rather than crack down on trollers/exploiters the whole time


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Cam#5887
they can breathe and actually chill


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
They just sit there for 2 hours before the session starts i dont see how that is  break

[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Cam#5887
but like, they know when sessions starts


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Cam#5887
if they use their heads ^


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they arent selected as a Helper they are kicked and End of story i dont see the importance


[07-Jun-20 11:53 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

also trey: -screenshots the whole thing bear typed-


[07-Jun-20 11:55 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
if we are limiting the people in servers then are we changing the requirement of not needing 20+ members to host a server


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
um since when are 20 staff used to train people?


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
..


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
no like


[07-Jun-20 11:56 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
20 people in general

Dear Molly_longestal,

I am messaging you on June 8th, 2020 at 12:49 AM EST to inform you that you are being issued a written warning.The High-Rank team has been made aware of admin abuse occurring at the Interview Center while interviewees were still present. We were informed that while you may have TPed fellow MRs, you TPed interviewees as well. Please note that admin abuse and immaturity is not tolerated at the Interview Center, especially while interviewees are present. While admin abuse would typically be a termination, this type of admin abuse is very minor and shouldn't end with you getting suspended or terminated. Please take this warning into consideration as you attend more sessions and be more courteous of your decisions and their effects. Thank you for your time.

my training had 4 trainees and a retrainer üòî


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
idk i like the thought process but im not too sure


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
none of which were recep


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
I just dont see the need for not setting limits if we end up only using 5-7 staff for Helpers


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
i need help understanding


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal u should add something to recep to be more interactive and not just one basic copy and pasted greeting and a room number. less and less people train for reception now


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
@xAfroTrey i dont see ur face workign well


[07-Jun-20 11:57 PM] ethan;#0003
Every trainee ends up getting trained, they just go to another server


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ya


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
@bman yes yes


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] ethan;#0003
Every trainee


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] ethan;#0003
gets trained


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
I am messaging you on June 8th, 2020 at 12:49 AM EST to inform you that you are being issued a written warning.


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
not every, theres always that LAST server that never gets trained.


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
hows that


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] ethan;#0003
Unless it is a rare occasion we don't have enough seniors to host


[07-Jun-20 11:58 PM] ethan;#0003
The last server usually has like 10 people in it


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] ethan;#0003
I only let seniors host if it has 20+ people in it.

ok then ill keep the positive parts of it and accept your feedback


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
ya arent we only allowed to host servers that have 20+ people


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
lol


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
thats what i was saying


[07-Jun-20 11:59 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal you should add a slock system where you can slock the server and only let trainees in


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
so then we technically are only getting 2 servers


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
And then we do the trainee slock like 10 minutes before start


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
and only 1 senior would be getting the opportunity to host


[08-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435

if we limit the people in servers then like no servers would spawn, wed get like 3 instead of like 7


[08-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
wed also have to constantly update how many helpers get in


[08-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435

[08-Jun-20 12:03 AM] bman#0435
@Beartikal


[08-Jun-20 12:04 AM] bman#0435
because usually after we mod the seniors jsut start their servers


[08-Jun-20 12:04 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
if she curses it shouldnt change anything, like ya she curses a lot well maybe tell her about it or try to keep it down but rn shes not breaking any rules, or maybe just tell her to keep it to a respectful limit because shes the only one i really see cursing


[08-Jun-20 12:04 AM] a. ·É¶#4222

Dear Molly_longestal,

I am messaging you on June 8th, 2020 at 12:49 AM EST to inform you that you are being issued a written warning. The High-Rank team has been made aware of admin abuse occurring at the Interview Center while interviewees were still present. We were notified that while you may have TPed fellow MRs, you TPed interviewees as well. Please note that admin abuse and immaturity is not tolerated at the Interview Center, especially while interviewees are present. While admin abuse would typically be a termination, this type of admin abuse is very minor and shouldn't end with you getting suspended or terminated. Please take this warning into consideration as you attend more sessions and be more courteous of your decisions and their effects. Thank you for your time.

not 45 minutes long


[08-Jun-20 12:23 AM] Cam#5887
yes


[08-Jun-20 12:23 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal but we still need to mod the servers so would we still need to use the new command for that


[08-Jun-20 12:23 AM] bman#0435
there could be 3 passers and they would still manage to take 40 minutes


[08-Jun-20 12:23 AM] Cooqkie#2809
to start the servers


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
ill find a way so that you can remain in the main server and use that command to automatically mod the appropriate ranks in the other servers


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
for the spills thing can all staff see it or just housekeeping


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
just the people who have to clean it up


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont want random messes in the hotel


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ye

[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cam#5887
hmmmmmm


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cam#5887
koala cafe


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cam#5887
does that


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Cam#5887
but everyone can see the spills so it will be differnet


[08-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
ye


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
ours is for roleplay mainly


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
it gives them other things to do


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Is it gonna be in rooms too


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Cam#5887
-


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie unsure


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Cam#5887
ignore that


[08-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[08-Jun-20 12:28 AM] Tattoblue#5828
thats immature, unprofessional, etc @xAfroTrey


[08-Jun-20 12:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
o hi tat


[08-Jun-20 12:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
@Beartikal add hr offices


[08-Jun-20 12:28 AM] Cooqkie#2809
for the auto rank thing does that mean we don‚Äôt need to rank second servers?


[08-Jun-20 12:29 AM] Cooqkie#2809
or is the command only gonna work for hrs


[08-Jun-20 12:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can make it work for seniors


[08-Jun-20 12:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
it just simply passes a rank 3 to their specified job


[08-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
but if thats too much power then idk


[08-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
ill maybe do a system where


[08-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
once they pass them there will be a board in each sevrer that shows passers from other servers, so u can call !promote via your main server


[08-Jun-20 12:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
and have it work like that


[08-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ooo


[08-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Cooqkie#2809
so like the pass command


[08-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but it ranks them


[08-Jun-20 12:34 AM] bman#0435

[08-Jun-20 12:34 AM] bman#0435

[08-Jun-20 01:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes yes it‚Äôs always so time consuming having to go to different servers and waiting for like 5 minutes to get in @Beartikal


[08-Jun-20 01:25 AM] Cam#5887
no probbbbbbbb! :D


[08-Jun-20 01:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no one is against managers getting mod at trainings and interviews right


[08-Jun-20 01:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
?


[08-Jun-20 01:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
the problem even with reducing to 1 warning


[08-Jun-20 01:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
is that RAnk 6, security hold them there for Mrs to join


[08-Jun-20 01:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
honestly i dont even know why we have handcuffs if theres no difference between holding them and letting them walk around


[08-Jun-20 01:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
either way they are spamming, exploiting, rejoining


[08-Jun-20 01:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
i never understood rank 6


[08-Jun-20 01:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
ngl


[08-Jun-20 01:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
they hold them there but it doesnt accomplish much


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
its more effective for abusing cuffs than actually holding someone


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] bman#0435
üëÅüëÑüëÅ


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] bman#0435
less of a disturbance


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
might have to do something about rank 6 too


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
dont know what exactly


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
yeah but handcuffs always bothered me


[08-Jun-20 01:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
the abuse is unreal


[08-Jun-20 01:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
and you just hold them and dont even kick them


[08-Jun-20 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[08-Jun-20 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
the problem is if i dont have cuffs i dont know what else i can do for them


[08-Jun-20 01:29 AM] bman#0435
i have a solution


[08-Jun-20 01:29 AM] bman#0435
no cbs = no need for security


[08-Jun-20 01:30 AM] bman#0435
no security = remove the rank


[08-Jun-20 01:30 AM] bman#0435
kthx thats my ted talk


[08-Jun-20 01:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
it would have to start with

removing the rank first


[08-Jun-20 01:30 AM] stacey#1000
I feel like removing a rank would make people upset


[08-Jun-20 01:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
im not saying im gonna do it


[08-Jun-20 01:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
but do u guys at least see the problem with the handcuffs and what little they actually accomplish if u think about it


[08-Jun-20 01:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes that its a bad tool
and no that theres no other solution i can think of


[08-Jun-20 01:32 AM] bman#0435
#tazers


[08-Jun-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000
i mean there will always be trollers and exploiters and there is not always an mr on the server to kick them

[08-Jun-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000
I was going to suggest a timed jail system like stapleton but the abuse would get worse and yes its a bad idea


[08-Jun-20 01:33 AM] stacey#1000
timed jail system to put trey in jail


[08-Jun-20 01:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
tazers were definitely worse than handcuffs lol


[08-Jun-20 01:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
tazers are an ABUSE MACHINE


[08-Jun-20 01:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
actaully


[08-Jun-20 01:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
to be fair i abused a troller in V5 with a taser i inserted


[08-Jun-20 01:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
so


[08-Jun-20 01:34 AM] Beartikal#9760

[08-Jun-20 01:34 AM] Cam#5887

[08-Jun-20 01:34 AM] Cam#5887

me and my tazer be like üî´üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[08-Jun-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
but also I feel like having something that is a timed system it may help eliminate trollers because they would get annoyed of having to wait 5 mins or whatever


[08-Jun-20 01:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
in america bloxton they would hook em up with M4s

[08-Jun-20 01:52 AM] bman#0435
the former mr role isnt even a necessity so they have no right to complain abt it


[08-Jun-20 01:52 AM] stacey#1000

@katie I think that is just someone saying she sent it because 1, eevee was not an MR when I sent that when that was my profile picture and 2, I really doubt she would scroll in staff announcements to find that.

The only way she could‚Äôve was if someone sent that to her then she sent it because she couldn‚Äôt have gotten it when that was my pfp

Also I feel like it‚Äôs unfair to keep talking about Anna and her leaking, like just because she‚Äôs friends with someone doesn‚Äôt mean she is going to leak. Can we just drop the topic because y‚Äôall are worrying about something that hasn‚Äôt even happened and it‚Äôs unfair for Anna to read that and see now negatively you think of her

i thought it was already no appeal


[08-Jun-20 07:20 PM] ethan;#0003
is it not?


[08-Jun-20 07:20 PM] ethan;#0003
but he was banned


[08-Jun-20 07:20 PM] ethan;#0003
then bypassed the ban on an alt


[08-Jun-20 07:20 PM] ethan;#0003
so he should wait a little longer


[08-Jun-20 07:20 PM] ethan;#0003
to appeal


[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003

[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
idk


[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
1 month maybe


[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
because he knew he was banned


[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and still decided to make an alt


[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
and somehow got banned on that alt also...


[08-Jun-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003

[09-Jun-20 02:45 PM] bman#0435

[09-Jun-20 02:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
alright


[09-Jun-20 02:45 PM] bman#0435

[09-Jun-20 02:46 PM] bman#0435
we employ people that r banned from the hotel, they just cant work shifts for a month and have to appeal


[09-Jun-20 02:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809

well i brought up the card because that means he exploited


[09-Jun-20 02:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
and the fact that he is training for security puts me on edge


[09-Jun-20 02:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[09-Jun-20 02:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-Jun-20 02:55 PM] bman#0435
@Cooqkie if someone submits a hinting report 3 months late should i still accept it-

[09-Jun-20 03:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
we should do more background checks on


[09-Jun-20 03:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
u guys should make some new rules for rank 6 | security


[09-Jun-20 03:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
some would slip through but if we stop them at training


[09-Jun-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
I wish we could only hire people if they had an account age of like 20 or over but I think it‚Äôs against roblox tos


[09-Jun-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
If they are really suspicious I just don‚Äôt rank them and let them waste their time thinking they are getting a rank so maybe they will quit


[09-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
actually your wrong its only against the rules if its a script that automatically kicks for under age


[09-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i only do that for ints


[09-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
since its manual its not rlly against rules


[09-Jun-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
So can we make a rule about account age?


[09-Jun-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
For interviews and trainings


[09-Jun-20 03:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
i would make it so that only if they have a suspitious background


[09-Jun-20 03:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
like if something feels off


[09-Jun-20 03:39 PM] bman#0435
OMG WHAT


[09-Jun-20 03:39 PM] bman#0435
R U SERIOUS


[09-Jun-20 03:39 PM] bman#0435
WOOOOOOOOOOO


[09-Jun-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve already been doing that so I‚Äôll keep doing that lol


[09-Jun-20 03:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah low account age looking to get a job is most likely an alt


[09-Jun-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
Can I still let them waste their time doing a training thinking they will get a rank but just never rank them so maybe they quit realizing they are wasting their time


[09-Jun-20 03:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
why not


[09-Jun-20 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
I think that‚Äôs the best way to do it


[09-Jun-20 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
Just kick them and never rank them without questioning them


[09-Jun-20 03:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg really


[09-Jun-20 03:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I normally don‚Äôt ever rank anyone under age of 5


[09-Jun-20 03:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it‚Äôs too sus


[09-Jun-20 03:50 PM] Beartikal#9760

[09-Jun-20 03:50 PM] Beartikal#9760

@emma; hes going to make it so managers get mod when they join trainings, etc


[09-Jun-20 05:11 PM] bman#0435
the only down side i see to that is they can mod anyone


[09-Jun-20 05:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes my new admin wont be "basic" admin im trying to make it "complex" admin that can do a lot of things


[09-Jun-20 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
it makes more sense for managers to just get mod when they join


[09-Jun-20 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
same with ranks 8+ at interviews


[09-Jun-20 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
they would get mod anyway so they should just get it when they join

[09-Jun-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
1) its not projected


[09-Jun-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
2) its most likely a rare item as it has a low amount of premium owners


[09-Jun-20 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Bman it's not going to go for 90k lmao


[09-Jun-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
3) someone can make like x3 what u sold it for


[09-Jun-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
ur right, it wont. itll go for 88999


[09-Jun-20 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Only 250 copies were bought and its never gone over 18k (except that time it projected)


[09-Jun-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
It might go for 30k or something but nah


[09-Jun-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
It literally has no value or demand


[09-Jun-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
if u wanna convince urself that then ok, but if its priced at 80k and u just ruined the trend then there u go lmfao


[09-Jun-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
A price doesn't mean its worth that much, look at the average price and rap smh


[09-Jun-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435
im-


[09-Jun-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435
the price determines the value and rap...

[09-Jun-20 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh so then why isn't it at 90k right now


[09-Jun-20 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
It will go up but slowly


[09-Jun-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435
because they need to  be sold for it to change


[09-Jun-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh and there isn't any demand for it so even if it does sell for that much its gonna be a rare occurance


[09-Jun-20 06:28 PM] bman#0435
u know what its ur limited idc what u do with it but all im saying is u couldve made a LOT more robux off of it


[09-Jun-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
Nope


[09-Jun-20 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591

Can we like start warning managers for not doing reports. I legit just make an announcement to help out with reports more and almost Elle is still pretty much the only one that does it sometimes. She is asking for help with reports in manager lounge again


[09-Jun-20 10:07 PM] bman#0435
whos elle


[09-Jun-20 10:07 PM] bman#0435
o


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
u meant alistelle


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
But like look at reports


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
And look at manager lounge


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
i dont think we can warn managers for not doing it but remind them lol


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
because if im being honest, half the management team is inactive


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
I already reminded them tho


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] bman#0435
also speaking of inactive, alex has an invalid inactive notice and overdue notice


[09-Jun-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003

sry i shouldve clarified who they were directed to lol


[09-Jun-20 10:10 PM] stacey#1000
She was just on discord 2 days ago


[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809
she was at the hotel


[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809
yesterday i think


[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
And like I said before if she deleted discord again and doesn‚Äôt respond to one of us messaging her about it, it‚Äôs her problem


[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] Cooqkie#2809
there for at least 1 hour


[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt see why I have to be the one to contact her all the time if you notice an issue lol. I‚Äôm not messaging her on Snapchat


[09-Jun-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
If she doesn‚Äôt respond to you dm then that says she‚Äôs inactive


[09-Jun-20 10:12 PM] Cooqkie#2809
doesnt she have corona


[09-Jun-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
And she can‚Äôt expect us to contact her any other way if she doesn‚Äôt even tell us she deleted discord


[09-Jun-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
Her mom is in the hospital that‚Äôs all I know

Dear Molly_longestal,

I am messaging you on June 10th, 2020 at 12:35 AM EST to inform you that you are being issued a written warning. The High-Rank team has been made aware of admin abuse occurring at the Interview Center while interviewees were still present. We were notified that while you may have TPed fellow MRs, you TPed interviewees as well. Please note that admin abuse and immaturity is not tolerated at the Interview Center, especially while interviewees are present. While admin abuse would typically be a termination, this type of admin abuse is very minor and shouldn't end with you getting suspended or terminated. Please take this warning into consideration as you attend more sessions and be more courteous of your decisions and their effects. Thank you for your time.

[10-Jun-20 10:30 AM] bman#0435
@katie she currently has 2 warnings as a senior that havent contributed towards a suspension yet, so either way i think she gets suspended


[10-Jun-20 10:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@katie id suspend it wasnt even her server


[10-Jun-20 10:32 AM] bman#0435

[10-Jun-20 10:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809
she cant just pop in and distract everyone


[10-Jun-20 10:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-Jun-20 10:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-Jun-20 10:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-Jun-20 10:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
did anna not report it


[10-Jun-20 10:33 AM] bman#0435

[10-Jun-20 10:38 AM] Cooqkie#2809
not as hosting


[10-Jun-20 10:38 AM] bman#0435

[10-Jun-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
@Cam i see that ur friends with cookie on roblox, can u see if u can message her as a friend


[10-Jun-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
because otherwise we have no form of communication with her


[10-Jun-20 12:46 PM] Cam#5887

@ethan; bro idk what happened but like u ranked this trainee to head of sec then to recep (i saw in logs) but their head of sec title still stayed? im confused


[10-Jun-20 12:48 PM] bman#0435
i ranked them back to recep because they asked y they were head of sec in questions


[10-Jun-20 12:48 PM] Cam#5887
does that happen a lot?

[10-Jun-20 12:48 PM] Cam#5887

[10-Jun-20 12:48 PM] bman#0435
cuz recep is RIGHT BELOW head of sec


[10-Jun-20 12:48 PM] Cam#5887

[10-Jun-20 12:48 PM] bman#0435

[10-Jun-20 04:56 PM] stacey#1000
its pretty easy you just give seniors the support team role then they can help with talkative role requests and tag you if its approved to give them the talkative role then take their role away when tickets are done


[10-Jun-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
@bman seniors can also host gamenights now

haha


[10-Jun-20 07:47 PM] bman#0435
do u think its from the video


[10-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
that she said she deleted but was up for 2 hours


[10-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
@Cooqkie


[10-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
welp, i guess it is a form of leaking


[10-Jun-20 07:48 PM] bman#0435
she didnt delete it like she said she did


[10-Jun-20 07:49 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez your bestie might of leaked


[10-Jun-20 07:49 PM] bman#0435
dont even try defending her on this


[10-Jun-20 07:49 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[10-Jun-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
ya but she claimed she took down the video but katie saw it was up 1 hour after


[10-Jun-20 07:50 PM] bman#0435
trey i guess ur missing my point


[10-Jun-20 07:50 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I dmed her after katie mentioned that it was still up and she took it down


[10-Jun-20 07:51 PM] bman#0435
she said she took down the video but she didnt. katie saw the video was still up an hour after, which is more than enough time for people to take screenshots (like the report). it also wasnt "handled" since she got no consequences for technically leaking sl


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] Cam#5887
youtube has its moments where it doesnt delete videos


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] ethan;#0003
bman doesnt like to forgive people


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] Cam#5887
it took 3 hours for my videos to get privated


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] bman#0435
ethan tf


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah to private a video it does take time


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] Cam#5887
it couldve just been a flaw in the youtube system


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] ethan;#0003
the video has to re upload or something


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] Cam#5887
we all know it was an accident, of course we know it was


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] bman#0435
it was up an hour after but ok


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] bman#0435
either way, she never got a consequence


[10-Jun-20 07:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435

[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
for me


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
e.e


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
it took


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
3 hours


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
to change it to private


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
which pissed me off


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
how long was that video


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
i believe it was probably a youtube server


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] katie#0200
Ava was just leaking in a sb vc lol


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
there was probably a lot of traffic


[10-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Cam#5887
and no, my wifi wasnt bad at that time


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
o so it was a 1 time thing


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
but it took 3 hours to change 1 video to go private


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
no, cause i did the next video and it took about 30 minutes


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] katie#0200
Ikr


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
o


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
i believe it just varies


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
about the video


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
the length, the amount of power in the video


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
etc


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
and i didnt have any 2-3 minute videos, so i couldnt tell you how long that would take


[10-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Cam#5887
the video i did was 9 minutes


[10-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Cam#5887
hmm


[10-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Cam#5887
yeah im not sure


[10-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Cam#5887
she may have forgot to hit save


[10-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Cam#5887
cause u have to hit save in order to change it


[10-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Cam#5887
"Save Changes"


[10-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Cam#5887

[10-Jun-20 08:13 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; i asked anq to send me clearer pictures if she gets them


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] Cooqkie#2809
im pretty sure shes getting them from cbs


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Didn‚Äôt we already deal with this yesterday?


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
not rly


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
we like


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
brought it up


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
but i dont think she got a consequence


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
but someone reported it


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
to cookie


[10-Jun-20 08:14 PM] bman#0435
so


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well wasnt that cause bonnie said he didn‚Äôt want anything more than a warning


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
now cbs have images of management+ newer channels


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wel


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
welp*


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
ya but that was when uni asid she took the vid down


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
and katie found it up an hour later


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] bman#0435
either way, i dont think bonnie warned. he just said the most is a warning


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
anqelvyy is reporting


[10-Jun-20 08:15 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it


[10-Jun-20 08:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmmm did Katie question why it was still up after she was told to take it down


[10-Jun-20 08:16 PM] bman#0435
no she just told her to take it down i think


[10-Jun-20 08:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Cause Emma said it doesn‚Äôt take that long to take down videos up there cause I was reading chat rn


[10-Jun-20 08:16 PM] Cooqkie#2809
it only takes a few seconds to change a video thats a few hours long so


[10-Jun-20 08:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and now cbs have seen this?


[10-Jun-20 08:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theres no reason for it to have beeen up 1 hour after katie told her to take it down


[10-Jun-20 08:17 PM] Cooqkie#2809
3 apparently


[10-Jun-20 08:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

please explain, someone, how this is major lack of grammar


[10-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal because they lacked punctuation and capitalization a bunch in every chatlog photo


[10-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
punctuation is not a lack of grammar im sorry thats not valid


[10-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760

[10-Jun-20 11:30 PM] bman#0435

This grammar thing has gotten out of hand, you guys need to relax the grammar rules and suspensions. This is not grammar class, this is a game in which kids play and want to get a job to have fun in and maintain a little bit of maturity. I also would like the grammar strike limit to increase in Trainings immediately. I would suggest you advise the MRs immediately of these changes.


[10-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
@High Rank


[10-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
what'd the new grammar strike limit be


[10-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
Currently it's 3 right?


[10-Jun-20 11:45 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[10-Jun-20 11:45 PM] ethan;#0003
some mrs kick so fast before they can even correct themself...


[10-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
New strike limit is going to be 5.


[10-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
Also, a missing period is not a strike.


[10-Jun-20 11:45 PM] bman#0435
üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Would spelling mistakes be a strike?


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] bman#0435
^


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
Every grammar rule as before is fine, just do NOT count a missing period as a strike.


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
can we make that rule for interviews and applications as well?


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes.


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
yay


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what if


[10-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they never put a period


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ever


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
so no vote? üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] ethan;#0003
that should be an announcement in the normal announcement channel


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] ethan;#0003
beacuse the lrs need to know also


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie Remind them, not strike them.


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xAfroTrey Your right, that's why the new strike limit is 5.


[10-Jun-20 11:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
as long as LRs are understandable and are spelling properly, i don't see the big issue with not using much grammar (periods, commas, etc.)


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
@xM_inn Yep


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
like


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
sizzleburger has the rule where LRs don't have to use grammar, but they must be understandable and can spell properly


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
i personally don't mind that. at first i thought it was bad, but it's actually alright.


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] ethan;#0003
So we need to tell the MR's and LR's, and we need to make sure the seniors guides are updated to have that new information in it


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
Yes.


[10-Jun-20 11:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
new strike limit is 5, effective immediately.


[10-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
rules for grammar relaxed as well


[10-Jun-20 11:49 PM] bman#0435
also does this have to do with that lr u asked y they were suspended


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] bman#0435
because their punishment was fine lol


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey the announcement would need to be a @/everyone announcement in #announcements


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] bman#0435
and that wasnt "out of hand"


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
so everyone knows


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
failing the troll test is still gonna make them fail the whole training right


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc if they dont know how to give a warning


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
or other stuff like that


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
all of a sudden people started warning for not using periods during the troll test....


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
i mean


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
not the troll test


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
warnings


[10-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
like Warning 1 | Trolling


[10-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so should i add that to my guide


[10-Jun-20 11:51 PM] stacey#1000
i already announced not to fail over 3 periods missed


[10-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
the 5 warnings thing


[10-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal its still 3 questions wrong is a fail right


[10-Jun-20 11:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so 3 questions wrong and 5 grammar strikes now?


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cooqkie Yes, just understand that grammar has to be relaxed.


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok :D


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] ethan;#0003
some lrs have like way more then 5 questions


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
5 grammar strikes but periods don‚Äôt count - what...


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] bman#0435
we have been relaxed on grammar tho-


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] stacey#1000
when I did suspensions today I did majority of the grammar stuff as warnings


[10-Jun-20 11:52 PM] bman#0435
does that mean the warning/suspension system for lacking grammar/punctuation will be changed


[10-Jun-20 11:53 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I still think we should stick to three imo


[10-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
Yes, I should see it "relaxed".


[10-Jun-20 11:53 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
We have cut down on grammar a lot


[10-Jun-20 11:53 PM] bman#0435
ya well pretty sure he made this change based off that one suspension lmfao


[10-Jun-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
We're sticking to 5 grammar strikes now to further make grammar lightened.


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal what about if staff dont use grammar at the hotel, because this thing your talking about seems like it is really only talking about interviews/trainings


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Bruh


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] bman#0435
can we at least have an hr vote to see if everyone agrees on this... this is a big change to the sessions


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Cant we have a vote


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Do we not have a say?.


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
@ethan; lightened at the hotel, little to no suspensions over it unless its major. Note: the card I saw today was NOT major.


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Trey vote or not I think he‚Äôs doing it


[10-Jun-20 11:54 PM] bman#0435
i dont rly like how ur just using ur owner power to make such direct changes without an hr vote


[10-Jun-20 11:55 PM] bman#0435
u said we basically r the faces of bloxton so i dont see y our opinions on this shouldnt be counted


[10-Jun-20 11:55 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Ya we can cut down on grammar but five grammar strikes NOT including periods is a bit extreme lmao


[10-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ·É¶ Nobody notices a period


[10-Jun-20 11:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
just remind them


[10-Jun-20 11:55 PM] ethan;#0003
in the announcement it needs to clarify what is a grammar strike and what isnt now because some lrs are NOT smart and report anythng


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] bman#0435
like i appreciate that ur trying to make changes to the hotel but our opinions should matter too...


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
What part is it hard to understand that this is a game and not an english class, this is a game for children.


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Uhm we cut down on the period portion of warnings in trainings idk what more we can do


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ima just redo my guides they need it anyway lol


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Ok if it‚Äôs a game for children then why even have the grammar rule üôÑ


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] bman#0435
^


[10-Jun-20 11:56 PM] bman#0435
whats the point in a rule when u can make 10 grammar mistakes and get a verbal warning for it


[10-Jun-20 11:57 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Missing my point


[10-Jun-20 11:57 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ya


[10-Jun-20 11:57 PM] bman#0435
trey i think she means whats the point of the grammar rule if were not going to be "up tight" about it


[10-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
i dont think we can be anymore lax with the rule than we already are


[10-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[10-Jun-20 11:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
oh sorry trey


[10-Jun-20 11:58 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Sorry I just don‚Äôt like this idea


[10-Jun-20 11:58 PM] stacey#1000
I know Koala doesn't make their staff use grammar but legit every time I go there I dont enjoy it because I find it more unprofessional not to use any grammar at all


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] ethan;#0003
The things that are needed are: First letter of a sentence is capital, and I's are capitals and they use ' (idk what its called)


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
again, can we have a vote on this...


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
^


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
if ur even reading  any of this


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
lol


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Cam#5887
i'd like a vote


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Cam#5887
ngl


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
We cut down on commas, we cut down on periods after warnings, we give them three shots, we are more lenient , we made our grammar tests easier like what more can we do


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
We are already not that strict on grammar I FEEL TBH


[10-Jun-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
i feel tbh*


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
not going to want to deal with someone who doesnt even try to use grammar and them to reply "the owner says we dont need to use a lot of grammar"


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
If its not major grammar they just get warned and not suspended


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
that kid who made the bloxton distrack has failed interviews like 5 times due to grammar


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
because he didnt use periods


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I just demoted someone for not talking in grammar to me, so oops !!!! :en_oops:


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
ethan nah it was more than that lmfao


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
he was in my session


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
o


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
oh


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
he was at mine but failed the grammar test


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
missing commas, random caps


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
misspelled words


[11-Jun-20 12:00 AM] ethan;#0003
oh


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
but lowkey he seems so nice


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] ethan;#0003
PART 3 WAS GARBAGE


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] stacey#1000
do you want an example of someone I suspended today for major lack of grammar?


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
o stacey no need


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] Cooqkie#2809
WOAH IT JUST STARTED RAINING LIKE CRAAAAZY


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
he used that as the reason


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] stacey#1000
which one


[11-Jun-20 12:01 AM] bman#0435
he thought there was no issue here

[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] ethan;#0003
i only suspend for grammar if i can OBVIOUSLY see they dont care and they are not using capital i's and are misspelling a ton of words and no capitals at all


[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
There was a lot more evidence then just that


[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] bman#0435
o no stacey


[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] bman#0435
thats the photo i used


[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
oh


[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] bman#0435
to show him


[11-Jun-20 12:02 AM] bman#0435
and he asked what was wrong with it


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] bman#0435
he pulled up the whole card and asked y they were suspended


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Point is, we are a team and I‚Äôd rather act like a team and make decisions together than just making it a final decision with NO SAY


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] bman#0435
and trey and i quoted


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] bman#0435
ya


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] bman#0435
like bear ur supposed to be the leader of this team but it feels the other way rn...


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
so was I not suppose to suspend that person now?


[11-Jun-20 12:03 AM] stacey#1000
.


[11-Jun-20 12:04 AM] bman#0435
nope u did the right thing


[11-Jun-20 12:04 AM] bman#0435
honestly if the grammar rule goes or changes then so do i lmfao. thatll just ruin the face of bloxton tbh


[11-Jun-20 12:04 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Even the whole training fiasco that u wanna do , my past two servers had millions of trainees , like some servers have more, some have less I don‚Äôt think we need these major changes Rn. We got a million members clearly were doing something right


[11-Jun-20 12:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Shut up


[11-Jun-20 12:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222

[11-Jun-20 12:05 AM] bman#0435
ya i dont think hes reading any of this


[11-Jun-20 12:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
@Beartikal can we talk about it more?


[11-Jun-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
^^


[11-Jun-20 12:06 AM] bman#0435
no point in even trying at this point, our opinions clearly dont matter anymore


[11-Jun-20 12:07 AM] bman#0435
our opinion only mattered in that case because we saw a flaw in that whole system


[11-Jun-20 12:07 AM] bman#0435
we clearly wont be able to change his mind on this


[11-Jun-20 12:08 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
@Beartikal come backüôÑ


[11-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Beartikal#9760
please make the change happen


[11-Jun-20 12:09 AM] bman#0435
im


[11-Jun-20 12:10 AM] bman#0435
did u read anything we said-


[11-Jun-20 12:10 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I think we needa talk about it


[11-Jun-20 12:10 AM] bman#0435
@Beartikal can i do a vote on it and see other hr opinions


[11-Jun-20 12:10 AM] stacey#1000
are we allowed to vote on it?

Most of the hrs don‚Äôt agree with this


[11-Jun-20 12:11 AM] bman#0435
ok whatever screw it im doing the vote because "please make the change happen" is clearly asking us to make a decision


[11-Jun-20 12:12 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
üòñ


[11-Jun-20 12:12 AM] xM_inn#2821
what if we keep it at 3 grammar strikes but missing a period or something else that is basic doesn't count as a grammar strike. and as far as dealing with people not using grammar goes, maybe we can keep punishments to either verbal reminders or suspensions. we'd only suspend if it's something major and the limit would be 3 days. no demotions or firings for no grammar.


[11-Jun-20 12:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
i think that is a nice compromise


[11-Jun-20 12:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
it's not much of a change, but it's also in consideration of bear's request to relax the grammar rules


[11-Jun-20 12:13 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
bear seems pretty set on making it five


[11-Jun-20 12:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
@Beartikal bear, what do you think on the above?


[11-Jun-20 12:14 AM] bman#0435
i thought missing periods never did contribute to a strike unless it was a constant trend in their punctuation


[11-Jun-20 12:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
that was only for warnings bman


[11-Jun-20 12:14 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I count periods


[11-Jun-20 12:14 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Not in warnings tho


[11-Jun-20 12:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
i do think we should relax the grammar rules a little though


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
at interviews i usually do 2 mistakes = 1 strike


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] bman#0435
for when i personally interview


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
well that's good bman, but it's not good if not everyone is doing that.


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
we need to make it proper procedure.


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
so everyone is on the same page.


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
I mean we can announce to seniors  not to count commas or periods as grammar strikes


[11-Jun-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
For applications


[11-Jun-20 12:16 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I get commas but why not periods. That‚Äôs such a basic thing that u learn at such a young age

[11-Jun-20 12:17 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i can write an announcement for it


[11-Jun-20 12:17 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Ok but why fix our grammar standards when we aren‚Äôt even that strict, like min we arent 
at adopt me we are a group. I don‚Äôt expect people at adopt me to use grammar because they aren‚Äôt being professional but they are working at the group and should show at least some sort of professionalism


[11-Jun-20 12:17 AM] Cooqkie#2809
and we can switch to it


[11-Jun-20 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
@bman read it again, i put suspensions instead of warnings, my bad


[11-Jun-20 12:17 AM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[11-Jun-20 12:18 AM] bman#0435
@xM_inn so basically someone could not use grammar at all, get a 3 day suspension, and get their ranks back...


[11-Jun-20 12:18 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I feel like what you announced and basically what we already do. We don‚Äôt fire for major lack of grammar


[11-Jun-20 12:18 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ima write an announcement about the warnings and send it here 2 see if u guys wanna switch to it bc its been forever since we voted lol


[11-Jun-20 12:18 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
I just fired someone for not using grammar and I don‚Äôt regret it


[11-Jun-20 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
@bman yes... that's what normally happens anyway, no? we never fire or demote for lack of grammar

[11-Jun-20 12:21 AM] xM_inn#2821
bear we didn't say we weren't going to do it, we were just discussing other possibilities and sharing our opinions as a team


[11-Jun-20 12:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; u said formal and informal warnings


[11-Jun-20 12:22 AM] a. ·É¶#4222

[11-Jun-20 12:22 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[11-Jun-20 12:22 AM] stacey#1000
We are just having a discussion about it


[11-Jun-20 12:22 AM] bman#0435
no offence but if u had to experience all we do just to host a training and interview session then u would understand our position...


[11-Jun-20 12:22 AM] bman#0435
to host a session that runs fluently, might i add^


[11-Jun-20 12:23 AM] bman#0435
we notify the mrs if theyre being too strict and they fix it right away


[11-Jun-20 12:23 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Why all these changes when we‚Äôve been fine for the past 3 years and now all of a sudden it‚Äôs a big issue. Surely we‚Äôre doing just fine if we hit 1 million and STILL continue to grow..

yeah I just don‚Äôt see the point. We‚Äôve ALWAYS been fine with these 3 grammar strikes

üôÇ


[11-Jun-20 12:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and we‚Äôve been more lenient with grammar. like for my grammar tests at interviews, I‚Äôm more lenient with the mistakes lol


[11-Jun-20 12:25 AM] bman#0435
again im not gonna argue if u guys just leave the chat and dont say anything lmfao


[11-Jun-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
We even approved of seniors grammar tests


[11-Jun-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
To make sure they were not strict


[11-Jun-20 12:26 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Clearly we all disagree


[11-Jun-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
Majority of the time trainees fail for failing the troll test at my sessions


[11-Jun-20 12:26 AM] stacey#1000
Like they don‚Äôt give warnings at all


[11-Jun-20 12:27 AM] bman#0435
6 votes isnt even half the hr team and its clear no one will agree


[11-Jun-20 12:27 AM] ethan;#0003
i dont like the 5 grammar strikes but I like the no periods are needed and the relax on gramamr


[11-Jun-20 12:27 AM] ethan;#0003
so do i still vote


[11-Jun-20 12:27 AM] bman#0435
like im rly sorry but if u wanted to have 5 strikes u shouldve done that in v1 when yall were desperate for workers


[11-Jun-20 12:27 AM] babymariobebe#7563
You can see the flaws better when you go to trainings/interviews rather than host them because you are the one going through it


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] babymariobebe#7563
And emma is that saying I'm not informed on my own game?? That doesn't even make sense


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
it‚Äôs not complicated grammar to put a period at the end of a sentence


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
a period missing is not a mistake


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Look robloz chat doesn't require periods period


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] Beartikal#9760
or necessary


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] babymariobebe#7563
@emma; on alts


[11-Jun-20 12:28 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
literally we are so lenient , I do not understand ..


[11-Jun-20 12:29 AM] bman#0435
if yall dont trust us and u come on alts to spy on us then why th r we hrs


[11-Jun-20 12:29 AM] babymariobebe#7563
You see it better when you try and get a job, why do you always say that we don't trust you??


[11-Jun-20 12:29 AM] stacey#1000
We already don‚Äôt fail people over periods. I legit announced this to all MRs awhile ago


[11-Jun-20 12:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
Its not trust its to ensure i'm getting the same experience everyone else is getting


[11-Jun-20 12:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
thats why i go on alts.


[11-Jun-20 12:30 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
If their only grammar mistakes it‚Äôs periods it‚Äôs fine, but if it‚Äôs literally everything then that‚Äôs where it becomes too much


[11-Jun-20 12:30 AM] ethan;#0003
if you think that we are strict on grammar you should see panda express.....

[11-Jun-20 12:32 AM] bman#0435
if yall want us to do kindergarten level then find a way to R's backwards and P's backwards lmfao


[11-Jun-20 12:32 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Rs and Ps??


[11-Jun-20 12:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Jun-20 12:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ok :D


[11-Jun-20 12:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809
should i make a second one for mrs or nah


[11-Jun-20 12:33 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
A lot of the younger kids are the ones like role playing at the hotel and not getting jobs. I think a lot of our workers range from 13-14 so if they don‚Äôt know how to capitalize the first word and just add a simple period then that‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs not like we are suspending them for missing a damn comma


[11-Jun-20 12:33 AM] bman#0435
poll deleted again, very mature


[11-Jun-20 12:33 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
Why are u deleting our fucking vote


[11-Jun-20 12:34 AM] bman#0435
if yall want to make decisions without our opinions then theres no point of me staying on the hr team if my opinions dont get accepted


[11-Jun-20 12:35 AM] stacey#1000
We are literally just stating our opinion and having a discussion but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt seem to let us to that


[11-Jun-20 12:35 AM] a. ·É¶#4222

emma and trey were helpful and good additions to the team...


[11-Jun-20 01:03 AM] stacey#1000
Emma and trey were speaking their opinions like we all were-


[11-Jun-20 01:03 AM] babymariobebe#7563
@everyone As you already saw, both Emmapendragon and Xafrotrey have been fired due to months long inactivity, insubordination, and toxicity/straight disrespect. We as the developers of the game make decisions and feel that we need to make decisions that benefit the game and it's purpose. We need a support system around us, not people who question and disrespect every single action we do/say. If you don't feel you can supportive without being toxic and promote a positive environment where we can all get along, you also need to question if this is the right place for you. This is NOT a dictatorship, this is meant to be a supportive community, and as such I need your support to help make this work.

emma and trey have been doing tickets


[11-Jun-20 01:04 AM] stacey#1000
Emma and Trey did so much for the team like honestly


[11-Jun-20 01:04 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
we gave our opinions


[11-Jun-20 01:04 AM] bman#0435

[11-Jun-20 01:04 AM] stacey#1000
Yes they disagreed but we all did and we all stated our opinions


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] ethan;#0003
:(


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] Beartikal#9760
They were extremely disrespectful about it.


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
uhm??


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] bman#0435
u deleted our votes 5 times...


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
are u kidding me?


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I can‚Äôt even rn is this a joke?


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] babymariobebe#7563
We didn't ask for a vote, that's why.


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
u didnt LISTEN to our opinions and shut us out


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok well we are a team


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
the vote was our way of showing


[11-Jun-20 01:05 AM] Beartikal#9760
I straight up said this was effective immediately.


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] Beartikal#9760
This wasn't something a vote was needed on.


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
we all didnt want it, you could of at least READ OUR OPINIONS


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] babymariobebe#7563
We do listen to your opinions, but we need to be able to make change where we feel the game is lacking as developers.


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
instead of shutting us out


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
u deleted our vote


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
u dont care waht we think


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Baby bear this is not the way to go about this..


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
....im sorry but


[11-Jun-20 01:06 AM] babymariobebe#7563
You forced the vote upon us, we didn't even say to put one up


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
we didnt need ur approval


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but sometimes votes are just to see opinions, u don‚Äôt have to do what the vote says


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
we wanted to show u oiur opinion


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
and what we thought


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] stacey#1000
So I get the message now. You don‚Äôt like our opinions and fire people for it. The vote was for you to see how we felt about it as we literally want was best for the group just like you


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] bman#0435
did they even get warned for their "inactivity"...


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
^


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Emma and trey are key players


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
u just made up any reason to fire them


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] bman#0435
or their "toxicity"


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
They interact with all the toxic ppl


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Do investigations


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Lead investigations


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
congratulations u affected ur group and ur gonna have to live with this


[11-Jun-20 01:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Solved many stuff that we cant


[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] bman#0435
because they werent toxic AT ALL, they were the ones who made us see things from a different point of view


[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Now both of them are gone, who can investigate and is strict now?


[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] bman#0435

[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] a. ·É¶#4222

[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
lmao..


[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how are we gonna be okay with them gone though... this is not okay


[11-Jun-20 01:08 AM] bman#0435
i dont think theyll wanna stay if they get rehired üíÄ


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
uhm


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] xM_inn#2821
emma and trey do a lot for us, I don't think this is very fair.


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
this is not acceptable


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
if min agrees with us


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Then we shud just have a revamp if they arent staying


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
ur in the wrong


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Get an entire new hr team


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] bman#0435
if emma was "inactive" then y was she promoted to general like 3 months ago


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Baby and bear please PLEASE rethink this @Beartikal @babymariobebe


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] bman#0435
or 5


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
This was not the move


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] bman#0435
idk how to count


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] xM_inn#2821
i think emma and trey could've been talked to in DMs or something prior, or at least placed on suspension while things calmed down.


[11-Jun-20 01:09 AM] a. ·É¶#4222
if trey is inactive then why did he do tickets earlier


[11-Jun-20 01:10 AM] stacey#1000
Emma and Trey are legit the opposite of what you said. They helped us all through so much this is not okay at all-


[11-Jun-20 01:10 AM] bman#0435

So we can really try to make some new adjustments making it easier for people to get a job


[11-Jun-20 09:38 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Grammar strike rule is fine at 5, I think that‚Äôs a fair number at interviews and trainings


[11-Jun-20 09:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
We also should stop with the CB checks at all sessions


[11-Jun-20 09:39 AM] ethan;#0003

[11-Jun-20 09:39 AM] ethan;#0003

Its a dark day here for sure


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
We should release a statement to MRs


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
yes we will be getting 2 new hrs as normal as planned. we will then review how the hrs are doing a week after to see if we're good or need more


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
Everything has happened so fast


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
I convinced her to stay for now since she‚Äôs not sure what to do like me. So you guys are stuck with me for now


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] xM_inn#2821
@RAMMGaming That's already been done


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Not about the firing


[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[11-Jun-20 09:41 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
How we overcome this


[11-Jun-20 09:42 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Give them some confidence that we are still a trustworthy group


[11-Jun-20 09:42 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 can I have an extension to promote Emmy


[11-Jun-20 09:42 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

[11-Jun-20 09:42 AM] stacey#1000

Ok here is where I am at right now


[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
At least the HR ones


[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs gonna feel like we are already replacing Emma and trey


[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] bonnie591#0591

[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

Let the dust settle


[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
its difficult to promote during the week


[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
weekends are better for promos


[11-Jun-20 09:43 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 09:45 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 09:45 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 09:54 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 09:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
anna and candy will be hella active


[11-Jun-20 09:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
btw did we say anything is wrong with maddy


[11-Jun-20 09:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
as im interested in either maddy or quw in the next vote


[11-Jun-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
they would be really good for australia/oceanic timezones


[11-Jun-20 09:56 AM] stacey#1000
Maddy was suspended before for admin abuse


[11-Jun-20 09:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
oh yeah


[11-Jun-20 09:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok no


[11-Jun-20 09:57 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Did we put out a public statement yet?


[11-Jun-20 09:57 AM] Cam#5887
i forget, who is promoting the seniors?


[11-Jun-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
bloo and stacey


[11-Jun-20 09:57 AM] Cam#5887
ah yes


[11-Jun-20 09:57 AM] Cam#5887
thats right


[11-Jun-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
senior promos may be a little late


[11-Jun-20 09:59 AM] Cam#5887
makes sense


[11-Jun-20 10:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank should we remove the fired/resigned hr emojis


[11-Jun-20 10:05 AM] ethan;#0003
i dont think we should now


[11-Jun-20 10:05 AM] ethan;#0003
maybe give it a few days


[11-Jun-20 10:05 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok boomer


[11-Jun-20 10:05 AM] ethan;#0003
because then people will think we are trying to just push them out asap


[11-Jun-20 10:06 AM] bman#0435
i think darky is in the cb discord

u guys probably wont see this but


[11-Jun-20 11:27 AM] Polk#1596
literally half of the MR team are about to resign saying "if you two dont own up to yourselves, we're out" and even pinging u guys


[11-Jun-20 11:27 AM] Polk#1596
it might be a good idea to make a statement to the MRs or else you're about to lose lots and lots of them

thanks for doing that


[11-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank id recommend we halt all promotions for at least the next 24 hours until we know who's going and who's staying


[11-Jun-20 12:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
We'll make the decision for the shift promotions on Saturday and if it needs to be pushed back so be it


[11-Jun-20 12:35 PM] Cam#5887
I agree with that


[11-Jun-20 12:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's unlikely Anna and candy will resign looking at staff lounge but we'll see


[11-Jun-20 01:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
k candy and anna will be staying but they do disagree with the statement


[11-Jun-20 01:50 PM] Cam#5887
yea

yes


[11-Jun-20 02:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
why were they banned from this discord if i may ask


[11-Jun-20 02:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
kicked ok


[11-Jun-20 02:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
banned


[11-Jun-20 02:09 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
?


[11-Jun-20 02:31 PM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 02:46 PM] ethan;#0003
i thought he couldnt get the role


[11-Jun-20 02:46 PM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
We're open and we hear that you guys don't like messing with grammar rules, we want to try something out and if it didn't work it could have been undone


[11-Jun-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
But last night it was taken unprofessionally and out of proportion


[11-Jun-20 03:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
We just wanted to try a new rule - that's all we wanted


[11-Jun-20 03:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
IF it was bad then sure we can scrap it


[11-Jun-20 03:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But now we don‚Äôt have 4 HRs, like I said in staff lounge, we always came together somehow with issues we all had different opinions on. Something could of been created and made, but instead we lost 4 HRs last night.


[11-Jun-20 03:34 PM] ethan;#0003
We lost 4 hr's because of something that could of been resolved in a matter of minutes.


[11-Jun-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
This is not really about the rule fully, its about how this whole thing was handled with Emma and Trey.


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
ok but like


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
i still dont understand why they were fired over this whole thing


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
^^


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
The comments and remarks they made toward us


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats why


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
because we all damn well know they didnt curse u out in that conversation


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
it wasnt about differing opinions


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
it was the disrespect


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
disrespect?


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
we all were being rude


[11-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
Not to their degree


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
what did trey do


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
what did trey do


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
And maybe that's a good point - why are we being rude over issues


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
We shouldn't trash each other


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
over issues


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
can u answer what trey did


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003
I can see what you are saying about emma, but trey does not do that


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and show proof of them cursing u out last night


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
I have hard time understanding why for Trey...


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003
At times emma does get rude


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
emma is more reasonable than trey


[11-Jun-20 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003
And it does annoy some of us


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Bear the only reason why it escalated so much was because you both kept deleting the poll.. if we would of kept it up and decided SOMETHING then we wouldn‚Äôt be in this position we are in now


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
but wtf did trey do


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
Emma even admitted she understands why for her but like Trey didnt really do anything tbh


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
look guys: yes maybe the whole situation was out of control and this is where we are now


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
can u just answer waht trey did


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
cause u know he didnt curse u out


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
^


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
and u know that image u sent in sl was sarcasm


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
I didn't take it that way


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
i took offense to it


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
that image you sent wasnt even from last night


[11-Jun-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
Trey said he was never even messaged from either one of you saying he was fired, he just got the notifications he got removed from the trello boards and then he saw his permissions on the discord server just slowly get taken away.


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
then maybe say "heyy trey can u please not say that about me?"


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
instead of firing him?


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
uhm?


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
FOR INACTIVITY ? too


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
like cmon..


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
I told him then he said i just wasn't thick skinned. he didn't admit to his fault.


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] ethan;#0003
I feel like a suspension would of justified the wrongdoings not a termination. :/


[11-Jun-20 03:38 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
u claim he cursed u out in the argument last night, and we all know he didnt


[11-Jun-20 03:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Because with a suspension they have time to think of what they did wrong, with a termination they just have regret of doing it knowing they can never go back and change.


[11-Jun-20 03:39 PM] Cam#5887
i agree that a suspension wouldve been better


[11-Jun-20 03:39 PM] Cam#5887
easily


[11-Jun-20 03:40 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
^


[11-Jun-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
If you had messaged them and spoke to them more they wouldve stopped but you just did this without even much of a warning to them


[11-Jun-20 03:40 PM] ethan;#0003
MR's have cursed out other MR's  in the past, they where rude to other mr's they where rude to hr's, not once did we ever think about firing them, we gave them a suspension, they learned from the mistakes they made and when the suspension was over they changed their personality.


[11-Jun-20 03:41 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
plus... they didnt curse u out last night


[11-Jun-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
You couldve suspended them and spoke to them about it...


[11-Jun-20 03:41 PM] ethan;#0003
Emma and Trey are KEY PEICES of this team, this team is almost NOT FUNCTIONAL without them.


[11-Jun-20 03:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Baby and Bear, you have to realize that you guys are owners of a 1 million group with HRs who work for you.. if you can‚Äôt handle couple curse words, I mean idk what to say. If anything this should of been taken into a serious DM with you and trey away from this chat to discuss how you guys really felt. That would of been the best option and I assure you trey would of listened..


[11-Jun-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
The reasons you gave for firing them makes no sense to me


[11-Jun-20 03:41 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
it rly isnt lmao


[11-Jun-20 03:42 PM] ethan;#0003
Last night trey said he was devastated and upset.


[11-Jun-20 03:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[11-Jun-20 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
This whole thing upset the entire MR team as well.


[11-Jun-20 03:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Both Emma and Trey were heavily involved with MR team


[11-Jun-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
I was on a VC with Trey and he was literally crying. He doesnt understand what he did nor did he get an explanation from anyone


[11-Jun-20 03:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So of course we‚Äôre here in this position


[11-Jun-20 03:43 PM] bman#0435
r yall even reading this or-


[11-Jun-20 03:43 PM] ethan;#0003
And Emma and Trey where NOT inactive, they where actively investigating, suspending, firing, banning. Just because they don't host... doesn't mean they aren't active.


[11-Jun-20 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
Im just going to say, you lost 4 HRs but trust me you may lose a lot more people and thats the truth


[11-Jun-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435
they were literally paid on june 3rd, lmfao


[11-Jun-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435
hence theyre not inactive


[11-Jun-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
They were def not inactive


[11-Jun-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
Trey legit did a bunch of tickets yesterday


[11-Jun-20 03:44 PM] ethan;#0003
And on top of that, they are collage students, they have jobs in real life, they have a family and friends, they had an INACTIVE notice up with the reasonings why they couldn't host.

Trey was truly a great HR


[11-Jun-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
So why was Trey fired....?


[11-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
MRs are starting to resign


[11-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
:/


[11-Jun-20 03:48 PM] ethan;#0003
I can 100% see why you guys are not happy with Emma, I know she was rude, I can see that part. I do not know why Trey was fired. Last night, Trey was trying to help, he didn't want to argue, he wasn't trying to argue.


[11-Jun-20 03:49 PM] stacey#1000
^^


[11-Jun-20 03:49 PM] stacey#1000
Emma even admitted it.


[11-Jun-20 03:49 PM] stacey#1000
Trey honestly did nothing wrong and did not deserve this.


[11-Jun-20 03:49 PM] ethan;#0003
I would say look back at Trey's chatlogs in the discord but they are deleted....

All my friends are leaving because of something that could of been prevented with a simple "Sorry that is how it is"


[11-Jun-20 04:19 PM] ethan;#0003
@babymariobebe Please do something :(


[11-Jun-20 04:19 PM] ethan;#0003

clearly what the HR and MR team is doing/saying isnt enough to actually address a genuine solutiion


[11-Jun-20 04:37 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder I am just being honest saying you have a lot of people wanting to leave rn. Please do something


[11-Jun-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435

@Polk Pople will think we are silencing them and that we are hiding something, literally all they need is a statement


[11-Jun-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
^


[11-Jun-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435

[11-Jun-20 05:16 PM] Polk#1596
warn them


[11-Jun-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
but instead some people decided to ban people


[11-Jun-20 05:16 PM] Polk#1596
literally too much is going on right now


[11-Jun-20 05:17 PM] Polk#1596
its not about them supporting trey and emma


[11-Jun-20 05:17 PM] Polk#1596
they are creating drama


[11-Jun-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
silencing gd wont make a difference


[11-Jun-20 05:17 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[11-Jun-20 05:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
I never expected for 2017 to happen again but x10 worse


[11-Jun-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
this is x10000 times worse tbh


[11-Jun-20 05:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
In 2017 we had no discord for Mrs and lrs so that's why it's less bad


[11-Jun-20 05:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
Then


[11-Jun-20 05:22 PM] bman#0435

[11-Jun-20 05:22 PM] Tattoblue#5828

They did more than that, they were encouraging people to resign  and causing more drama than what was needed, saying they were going to expose us and what not


[11-Jun-20 05:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i wish i took screenshots oof


[11-Jun-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
what exactly did they do to encourage others to resign and cause more drama


[11-Jun-20 05:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
They tagged me saying to resign, one of them said "It's been 2 years without no promo its a sign"


[11-Jun-20 05:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they were causing more trouble when it wasnt needed


[11-Jun-20 05:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
And like i said, talking about how they were going to make a yt video exposing us

[11-Jun-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
A lot of people are upset, thats the truth. You have a lot of people wanting to leave, this is not looking good. Please make a statement I don't know what to tell LRs.


[11-Jun-20 05:44 PM] bman#0435
we genuinely cant say anything without it being considered as leaking so


[11-Jun-20 05:44 PM] ethan;#0003

I have nothing against it

We are at a vulnerable spot right now, we have to make sure the next move is a smart PR move

We don‚Äôt know what Emma is coming up with to respond


[11-Jun-20 06:43 PM] katie#0200
I don‚Äôt plan on resigning but I do disagree with the whole firing emma and trey thing, I believe that could‚Äôve been handed better and now we need to do something to save our reputation like ramm said we‚Äôre at a vulnerable spot right now

[11-Jun-20 09:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
maybe put something in there to thanks the former HRs for their work


[11-Jun-20 09:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal should i cancel my themed session then


[11-Jun-20 09:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
just so they can't turn around and say "they dont care about the HRs"


[11-Jun-20 09:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its today then you can finish it for today


[11-Jun-20 09:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[11-Jun-20 09:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[11-Jun-20 09:45 PM] Beartikal#9760

üëç other than that very well put


[11-Jun-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal how long are sessions canceled for?


[11-Jun-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
until reforms are done which shouldnt be too long


[11-Jun-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[11-Jun-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
we didnt specify as we didnt want to be pressered into by a date


[11-Jun-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
hope thats okay


[11-Jun-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
so should I cancel the ones I have tomorrow?


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah go ahead


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Are you opening  general now


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000

[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
can we close tickets


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
too


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
@a. ·É¶ think we should wait until they read it a bit first


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
right?


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
like so they soak it in


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
instead of disucssing it in general


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
Well they can read it but


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal can we close tickets


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] a. ·É¶#4222
I mean ur choice


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
for now


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
for now yeah i guess


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] ethan;#0003
keep it closed until atleast tomorrow morning


[11-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
we're in a tough spot we have to recover


[11-Jun-20 09:48 PM] stacey#1000
ok idk how to close tickets so just wont read them for now


[11-Jun-20 09:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
yea


[11-Jun-20 09:48 PM] ethan;#0003
apparently mallory is in one of the voice chats and is telling the lrs she is going to be getting back her rank üíÄ


[11-Jun-20 09:48 PM] ethan;#0003
or something along the lines of getting hired again


[11-Jun-20 09:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
keep it closed for now


[11-Jun-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
wait so r yall just gonna find random people as replacements


[11-Jun-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
if not and were doing seniors, theres kinda a reason we narrowed it down to 2 seniors and no other "candidates" had a single vote


[11-Jun-20 09:53 PM] a. ·É¶#4222

[11-Jun-20 09:58 PM] bman#0435

[11-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Cam#5887
do we know an estimated time when we will be off of the lockdown?


[11-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Cam#5887
or is it just when things get back into shape?


[11-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760

[11-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
does that mean like any MR?


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
or are we still gonna vote


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah what'd u guys mean with that part


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
im confused by it


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
cause we always vote for a shift


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
and a new HR


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
so i, and it seems tatto, were a little confused by that part


[11-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Cam#5887
and ive been asked numerous times


[11-Jun-20 11:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
bear can we at least open reports channel now


[11-Jun-20 11:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you do that some MIGHT use it as a chat channel be weary


[11-Jun-20 11:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We will remove roles for those violating the rules


[11-Jun-20 11:40 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
aka talking in the channels


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
just be prepared for it is all im saying yeah


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
bear, did u see what i said? we are confused, tatto and i are


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
not to be pushy lol


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Well if you don't think it's a good idea we dont have to do it


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Cam#5887
just was concerned


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
you have a point


[11-Jun-20 11:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah we'll be doing some stuff to fill some holes @Cam
some people have retired so we just need to work back to where we were


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
i cant get too specific about it for right now, hope thats okay with you guys


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
yeah, but are we still gonna vote?


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
cause we need to have inputs on who is a good candidate or not


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
we're still deciding a few things in the backend


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
okay


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
thanks for clarifying


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
wish i could clarify a bit more but we only have ideas in mind


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
once we get to a more larger thing we can return with it


[11-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
and propose it


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
okay, cause i dont really want a head to be jumped to HR


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
XD


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
nah not like that dont worry


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
okay great


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
thanks for ur time


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
yessir


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Cam#5887
im going to go watch dance moms now


[11-Jun-20 11:43 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming i had to close the report channels because people where posting porn and using it as general discussion


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
:facepalm:


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Cam#5887
why the hell are they acting like that


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ok, thanks


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Cam#5887
NO rules have changed


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
por-


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Cam#5887
its the same as it has always been, its absolute bs that they are doing that


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Cam it might have to do with psychology but apparently people love to throw heat on fire sometimes especially with rules and stuff


[11-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
im not that surprised


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
im not either


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
but its just


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
excessive


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
its crazy yeah


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
we are trying to rebuild


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
to be a stable team again\


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
we arent doing this to hurt people


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] Cam#5887
we are doing this to help the group


[11-Jun-20 11:45 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[11-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
they were banned to stop the tea doc and an outcome like this but it wasnt avoidable i guess


[11-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
but yeah it will be undone


[11-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
they werent banned just to be banned


[11-Jun-20 11:46 PM] Beartikal#9760

[11-Jun-20 11:48 PM] Cam#5887

[11-Jun-20 11:48 PM] Beartikal#9760

[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
ngl i never disliked vedom though


[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
some of you may disagree but i mean everytime i saw him he was on the game


[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] ethan;#0003
he sucks up to hrs


[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] ethan;#0003
i see him a lot


[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] ethan;#0003

[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Cam#5887
ahhh


[11-Jun-20 11:49 PM] Cam#5887
hes caused so much drama


[11-Jun-20 11:50 PM] ethan;#0003
he stands directly infront of hrs at trainings, he only goes to the hotel when an mr+ is in the server


[11-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
true


[11-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cam#5887
and he stands AFK for like 20 minutes of the shift "doing reports"


[11-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cam#5887
when i tell him to server hop, he ignores my PM


[11-Jun-20 11:50 PM] Cam#5887
so i have to bring him and tell him to server hop


[11-Jun-20 11:54 PM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hmm I don't see them in the Discord server


[12-Jun-20 12:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
But they are in the group; they're currently suspended


[12-Jun-20 12:30 AM] Cam#5887
@xM_inn are we allowed to change like a part of the template when using it


[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887
like


[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887
from polks


[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] Cam#5887
thanks for clarifying


[12-Jun-20 12:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
mhm


[12-Jun-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
the templates are just to make it easier for u guys when u issue the disciplinary action


[12-Jun-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
still feel free to be creative and make ur own letters or edit the template


[12-Jun-20 12:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
up to u


[12-Jun-20 12:32 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:42 AM] Polk#1596
Wait what, am I supposed to cancel my sessions? @Beartikal


[12-Jun-20 12:42 AM] Polk#1596
I've got sessions today and tomorrow


[12-Jun-20 12:43 AM] Tattoblue#5828
i think so, i cancelled my theme session


[12-Jun-20 12:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
yeah you should cancel them just to be on the same page with everyone


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
and with what the statement said


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
things should return to normal not too long


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Cam#5887
are we still receiving payments?


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Polk#1596
Okay I gotcha


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Cam#5887
okay


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Cam#5887
i didnt think that would change


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Cam#5887
but


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Polk#1596
Do u want bonnie to open the public chats now?


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Cam#5887
was just wondering


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
no public chats remain closed still


[12-Jun-20 12:44 AM] Beartikal#9760
just for the meantime


[12-Jun-20 12:45 AM] Polk#1596
Okay


[12-Jun-20 12:45 AM] Beartikal#9760

i dont want former hrs though because thats gonna cause much more mess


[12-Jun-20 11:49 AM] Polk#1596
cory is pretty active but idk


[12-Jun-20 11:49 AM] Polk#1596
isnt he immature at times? no idea


[12-Jun-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
again, im pretty sure baby and bear said they were going to handle it so unless they told u guys (bods) to ask us who we think then i dont think we shoukd get ahead of ourselves


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
bman we're discussing our options


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] Polk#1596
jesus christ since when did he get so many logs on senior board


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
in case we are asked


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] Polk#1596
he is up there with candy


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] bman#0435
who even said the seniors were our options


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
if u dont want to participate that is fine


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
better to be prepared then not


[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] Polk#1596

[12-Jun-20 11:50 AM] Polk#1596

[12-Jun-20 11:53 AM] Polk#1596

what about emily


[12-Jun-20 11:56 AM] Polk#1596

[12-Jun-20 11:57 AM] Polk#1596
like i said


[12-Jun-20 11:57 AM] Polk#1596
if it were down to 4 seniors


[12-Jun-20 11:57 AM] Polk#1596
it'd be anna, candy, quwanterz, and emily


[12-Jun-20 11:57 AM] Polk#1596
in my opinion


[12-Jun-20 11:57 AM] Cam#5887

[12-Jun-20 11:57 AM] ethan;#0003

[12-Jun-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
yes polky agreed


[12-Jun-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
and then we have daisy and lyss as back-up too


[12-Jun-20 11:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
i doubt baby would want more than 6 hrs all at once


[12-Jun-20 12:02 PM] bman#0435
i feel like u guys r just showing pure bias towards emily and anna. like literally 2 months ago bonnie stated that u cant even spot the difference between them... and polk ur in a clique with them which may even lead u to want them to be hrs more. i feel like this whole vote is pure bias in favor of anna and emily. no offence to u guys but literally one of the first things cam said when he got into the hr chat was how he didnt like that anna and emily basically did all the work... and now u want both of them to be shifts? u guys arent even taking this "options" discussion seriously, i made a point, got ignored, and even got sarcasm back. baby and bear stated they dont even know if theyre picking seniors, so i dont know y yall r getting ahead of urselves already replacing the 4 shift managers that departed from this group not even 3 days ago, thats kinda inconsiderate to them and all they did to this group. if u want to discuss the seniors before they even resign or make up their mind on this situation, fine, but otherwise i dont think we should show bias towards friends and people we said we wouldnt promote not long ago then bring them to the hr team


[12-Jun-20 12:02 PM] ethan;#0003
can you sum that up


[12-Jun-20 12:02 PM] ethan;#0003
into a short sentence


[12-Jun-20 12:02 PM] bman#0435
nope


[12-Jun-20 12:03 PM] bman#0435
it wouldnt hurt to read lol


[12-Jun-20 12:03 PM] ethan;#0003
wait did we agree on emily?


[12-Jun-20 12:03 PM] bman#0435
apparently the 4 of them did


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
i was pissed at anna and emily


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] bman#0435
also can we talk about last night when an mr literally leaked my gamenight link-


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
because they would steal my servers


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
all the time


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] ethan;#0003
anna + emily at the same time would be no sessions for anybody else to host


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
i would be in a server


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
waiting for 30 minutes


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] bman#0435
its not just that, i just see pure bias in some of ur voting...


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
then emily or anna pop in


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
and just take it


[12-Jun-20 12:04 PM] Cam#5887
and it pissed me off, but then they settled down


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] Cam#5887
they chillaxed


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
cam they go inactive when they dont get shift


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
lol


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] Cam#5887
true ig


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
they also ignored me when i got shift


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] Cam#5887
me too bman


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] Cam#5887
me too


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
last time they asked me to even host was 5 months ago


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
and theyre always magically "unavailable" when im hosting


[12-Jun-20 12:05 PM] ethan;#0003
i think emily should be a back up if we have space


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] katie#0200
bman u host at like 2 am for them


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] ethan;#0003
because she has had more problems then anna in the past


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] ethan;#0003
i host at like 5 am for them


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] ethan;#0003
and they both come


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] Polk#1596
so basically, you're saying that im bias towards anna and emily because im friends with them?


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] bman#0435
o im not good at timezones lol


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] bman#0435
i said i felt that way


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] bman#0435
not that it is the true reason


[12-Jun-20 12:06 PM] Polk#1596
you can feel that way but dont use it as a reason


[12-Jun-20 12:07 PM] Polk#1596
most of us are literally friends with every senior


[12-Jun-20 12:07 PM] bman#0435
i listed more than just that in the message-


[12-Jun-20 12:07 PM] ethan;#0003
and i do feel like they are "magically unavailable" when i ask them to host interviews but not trainings


[12-Jun-20 12:07 PM] Polk#1596
doesnt defeat the fact that you used it as a reason


[12-Jun-20 12:07 PM] bman#0435
i never said it did


[12-Jun-20 12:07 PM] Polk#1596
i dont have anything against you bman, so i'd appreciate if you could not assume stuff like that about me


[12-Jun-20 12:08 PM] bman#0435
ok sry


[12-Jun-20 12:08 PM] Cam#5887
i have absolutely nothing against anyone in this team


[12-Jun-20 12:08 PM] Cam#5887
you are all legit the minds of the team


[12-Jun-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
It isn't inconsiderate, it's just that in order for our group to survive we need a strong HR team. I respect the former HRs for their work but they made the decision to resign which means new people have to step-up and continue their roles as HRs for the success of our group. The votes aren't bias, I could say that Fraux being suggested so early **prior** to Anna and Emily was quite bias considering he'd just come back from inactivity, but I'd rather not get into that debate. Anna and Emily have been working for so long, they're active, they're dedicated, they're hard-working and there is honestly not one thing holding them back from a promotion anymore. I don't think it's very fair to be assuming Polk is being bias due to his friendship with Anna and Emily either.. if Polk was being bias he could've suggested them every single shift vote. Don't take this personally or anything but that needs to be cleared up.


[12-Jun-20 12:09 PM] Polk#1596
it's alright


[12-Jun-20 12:11 PM] bman#0435
alrigth so then if were discussing new shifts then y not discuss new seniors


[12-Jun-20 12:11 PM] bman#0435
were clearly going to need more seniors


[12-Jun-20 12:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hm


[12-Jun-20 12:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think it's fair to say new HRs are much more prioritized over new seniors at the moment.


[12-Jun-20 12:38 PM] bman#0435
alright but wed only be having 3 seniors to host sessions then

[12-Jun-20 07:41 PM] ethan;#0003
https://trello.com/c/6NphBYBE/32-xmirk would this be doxing if he had permission from the person in the image to send the image? it says he had permission in the description


[12-Jun-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
becus i know mirk well and i dont think he would do it if he intended to harm someone


[12-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435

[12-Jun-20 09:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
Comms channels shouldnt interfere much with our reforms, we just closed it to stop drama discussion and stuff


[12-Jun-20 09:48 PM] katie#0200

[12-Jun-20 09:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
id rather have it slowly fill up


[12-Jun-20 10:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan; no that wouldn't be doxing if they had explicit permission, do you know a bit more about what happened?


[12-Jun-20 10:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
whoever closed the channels can now re-open them, i dont know which perms were messed with to close it


[12-Jun-20 10:03 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-Jun-20 10:11 PM] ethan;#0003

purge works in announcements


[12-Jun-20 10:12 PM] xM_inn#2821

[12-Jun-20 10:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[12-Jun-20 10:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[12-Jun-20 10:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
we shouldn't have to reclose general anymore


[12-Jun-20 10:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
it should be fine


[12-Jun-20 10:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
the spamming and stuff should stop now im prty sure


[12-Jun-20 10:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and if someone is trying to cause drama?


[12-Jun-20 10:16 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ban or just remove roles


[12-Jun-20 10:16 PM] ethan;#0003

[12-Jun-20 10:16 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-Jun-20 10:16 PM] Beartikal#9760
people are pinging ppl randomly i dont get it


[12-Jun-20 10:16 PM] bman#0435
i thought we warn people for drama


[12-Jun-20 10:16 PM] bman#0435
people do daily pings


[12-Jun-20 10:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
@RAMMGaming personally i'd ban if it's getting intentional and malicious, but maybe kick them from the server first and allow opportunity to stop


[12-Jun-20 10:17 PM] bman#0435
so they ping their friends everyday


[12-Jun-20 10:17 PM] bman#0435
and their friends ping them back


[12-Jun-20 10:17 PM] Beartikal#9760

[12-Jun-20 10:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ik I was just wondering cause it seemed strange that she didn't have the role already with her resignation being very recent


[12-Jun-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
o i thought i gave her it when she resigned


[12-Jun-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435
someone may have took it from the wrong isabella?


[12-Jun-20 10:46 PM] bman#0435

[12-Jun-20 10:46 PM] xM_inn#2821

[12-Jun-20 10:46 PM] xM_inn#2821

[13-Jun-20 05:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
it appears to be a stopping in animations

[13-Jun-20 05:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
it might just be a script delay or something of the sort


[13-Jun-20 05:59 PM] Beartikal#9760

[14-Jun-20 01:10 AM] bman#0435
o i just thought there was more to it that prevented her from getting it like last week when she asked


[14-Jun-20 01:11 AM] bman#0435
wouldve been nice if we were able to know she was on the verge of getting it because some input on her past affected her not getting it before

She didn't get it because of drama created in 2017, however, due to how long its been (3 years) we felt that the past is the past. She still put work in the group and we appreciate that.

[15-Jun-20 07:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
ik but like there's no role for him in the group and stuff


[15-Jun-20 07:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
so idk if it's just like a discord role thing


[15-Jun-20 07:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
or whether he's back as an HR


[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003

[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
i think of it as like


[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
queen elizabeth


[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
like the queen


[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
princess


[15-Jun-20 07:54 PM] bman#0435
and so forth


[15-Jun-20 07:55 PM] bman#0435
so its like highest role down to lowest role


[15-Jun-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal Would you like me to add you to the ban request overflow board and make you the owner of it? This is a board that was created not too too long ago, not sure if you remember me mentioning it to you, but since the management board got overflowed a lot with ban requests, the limit being 600 being filled fasted the overflow board was made for managers to put more ban requests there. That's all it is, but as it is a board being used not sure if you wish to have ownership of it. I know you said no before but thought I would ask again.


[15-Jun-20 07:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
IF it's just a board with names for bans and doesn't contain anything super inportant like promo requests , etc then i don't really care about it.


[15-Jun-20 07:58 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal can we contine with MR promotions


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
Of course.


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
and for artyphos and saab did they already get updated on the new info?


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435
wait bear can u like explain to me the part of the manager promos, im just confused on that


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
Nope, nobody has been briefed yet on new information.


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
They all have been ranked.


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
The newest thing is the ban request overflow board


[15-Jun-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
They need to be added to that


[15-Jun-20 08:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
However I would like to be a member of it just to have access to it


[15-Jun-20 08:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
so you can go ahead and add me to it


[15-Jun-20 08:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
@bman Which part?


[15-Jun-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
like i dont rly get y u picked saab and arty over the other 2 heads that r abt to get promoted to manager, and y we have 2 new managers as part of the reform


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal whats your trello username so I can add you


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
mxplaysroblox


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
oo u changed it


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
did they get added to the trellos?


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
i thought it was mamapeachprincess


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
arty and saab


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
Not yet


[15-Jun-20 08:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
We can do the other two as well, we just wanted to promote them two to manager, we can do more @bman this is why it says the list is expected to change as we knew more promos are coming


[15-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
If you guys could brief everyone and give appropriate access areas that would be great and super helpful.


[15-Jun-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal ok did it work can you see it now


[15-Jun-20 08:03 PM] ethan;#0003

[15-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jun-20 08:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
Probably, for right now we didn't.


[15-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
o ok


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
He will not have ranking perms, it's just a for-show thing.


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
is it gonna be a rank others can get promoted to


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
like shift > gm > ryans rank > bod


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
Oh, no of course not.


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
It's unique.


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
or staying as shift gm bod


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
bear bear bear dms!!!


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003

[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
the Discord ranking is not how it will be on the group @bman im still deciding how i want it


[15-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just gave him higher on discord so he could see everything and stuff


[15-Jun-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jun-20 08:16 PM] bman#0435
mack asked me if we were and i said i dont see y we would


[15-Jun-20 08:18 PM] ethan;#0003
i had to slow mode general @Hilton Founder


[15-Jun-20 08:18 PM] ethan;#0003
they are going crazy


[15-Jun-20 08:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
Good! Thanks.


[15-Jun-20 08:21 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal do we need to tell u or ask you if we put a channel in slowmode


[15-Jun-20 08:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
Telling is okay for now but in the future, in accordance ot the #rules you should ask.


[15-Jun-20 08:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
IF slowmode is already on, i do not mind if you modify the time on it.


[15-Jun-20 08:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
For times like these, i expected it to be put on, so good job


[15-Jun-20 08:30 PM] ethan;#0003

No you may Archive easily, its just sometimes deleting removes some evidence.


[15-Jun-20 08:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
Archive makes it still appear but removes the card.


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@cytoxtin


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] bman#0435
i dont think we ever delete cards unless theyre duplicates


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ADD CYTO BACK


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
Of course.


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you have any more q's with rules dont be afraid to ask!


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just wanted some more groundrules here as it's usually not restricted


[15-Jun-20 08:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So is Cyto above us


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
in the Discord, unsure how it will be on the Group,.


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
Probs below on the group.


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And what will his role be?


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Great addition to have back


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
S | Strategic Advisor Im thinking


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
S and H are uniques, meaning they are rarely promoted to


[15-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
its not a number system for those.


[15-Jun-20 08:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok and what are his duties


[15-Jun-20 08:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Just wanna know what we can approach him with if he is needed


[15-Jun-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill add him so he can explain more of it. he can explain stuff better.

Hey, some people are saying that we're banning people for expressing an opinion, but we are only taking extreme measures if they are spamming copy and pasted things.

^ The MR movie night was leaked as well.


[15-Jun-20 10:36 PM] bman#0435
so if something can actually be done about these 2 things instead of constantly pushing it aside to avoid issues then please do, pushing it aside will make more issues

[15-Jun-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs a newer MR because I‚Äôve hosted MR movie nights before and it‚Äôs never been leaked until yesterday


[15-Jun-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
So, likely a newer MR

[16-Jun-20 12:31 AM] ethan;#0003
We got rid of it but had to bring it back because they started to just troll like crazy and spam


[16-Jun-20 12:31 AM] bman#0435
hence y the cb rule was reestablished


[16-Jun-20 12:31 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yeah but we should have reforms


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] bman#0435

[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] bman#0435
so well see what bear and baby do


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Refresh the rules


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] ethan;#0003
if the cb's didn't spam like crazy i would say yes remove the rule


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] bman#0435
because we dont know anything theyre doing


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] Beartikal#9760
you guys do realize when im in the server the CBs dont spam and its all because of one reason


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] ethan;#0003
they want bans


[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] bman#0435

[16-Jun-20 12:32 AM] ethan;#0003
that is all they want


[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
reason: *i dont ban them*


[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760

[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] ethan;#0003

i mean if they call me things like "rat" or whatever i just play along with it


[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
i always dont let it get to me


[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] bman#0435
i dont play along with trolling


[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
well ill just tsa ylike


[16-Jun-20 12:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
"ok"


[16-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
or


[16-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
"ok sir"


[16-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
they stop quickly


[16-Jun-20 12:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
after they realize i just dont care


[16-Jun-20 12:34 AM] bman#0435
not for me, if i were to respond like that theyre just continue


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] ethan;#0003
sometimes when i go to the hotel i change my outfit so they dont join me


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
They only want the attention


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs all they want


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
the rule right now is that if a CB joins and they are on the list they aree auto kicked or banned


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] bman#0435
thats what i did but now i just dont go to the hotel as often lol


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
The more we ban, they get what they want. That‚Äôs why they keep doing it it‚Äôs like a contest


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
RAMM


[16-Jun-20 12:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
100% agree


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
if we stop the contest


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
they stop


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] bman#0435
and we cancelled the cb rule before, but it was placed back because they got too out of hand apparently


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont recall removing it


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
must have not been done by me


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont remember when this was


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
it was removed a while ago


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
i think like a year ago


[16-Jun-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
for like 1 month we tested it


[16-Jun-20 12:37 AM] ethan;#0003
but then after a few weeks they started to take advantage of it

[16-Jun-20 12:54 AM] Cam#5887
that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm saying


[16-Jun-20 12:54 AM] stacey#1000
He has been like begging to appeal, which lowers his chances more.


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] stacey#1000
Also.


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887
plus


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] stacey#1000
Recently he was in a tea server.


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887
lemme show u his appeal from 2019


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887
that was ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
He‚Äôs bad news


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887
indeed


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Cam#5887
lowkey he could attempt to work with CBs


[16-Jun-20 12:55 AM] stacey#1000
He was appealed once and ruined it so I don't like the idea of him being appealed again.

[16-Jun-20 01:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
Dobw is a lost cause srry


[16-Jun-20 01:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
Worse than dot


[16-Jun-20 01:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
That's saying something


[16-Jun-20 01:31 AM] ethan;#0003
fed said before v3 comes out full release he plans on adding boats back to v2


[16-Jun-20 01:32 AM] bonnie591#0591
OOP


[16-Jun-20 01:32 AM] bonnie591#0591
Easiest way to drive a boat rn is doc md


[16-Jun-20 01:32 AM] ethan;#0003

[16-Jun-20 01:40 AM] bman#0435
@Beartikal if u needa test it on 1 person instead of the whole server u can have me help u lol


[16-Jun-20 01:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
ye


[16-Jun-20 01:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
i was about to say


[16-Jun-20 01:40 AM] Beartikal#9760

[16-Jun-20 01:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
here bman u can bee test subject


[16-Jun-20 01:40 AM] bman#0435
ok


[16-Jun-20 01:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Applications everywhere...


[16-Jun-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes sir


[16-Jun-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
welcome to 2020 application center


[16-Jun-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
still using trello


[16-Jun-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
ngl id rather have a review-process in game then a bot auto rank when its passed


[16-Jun-20 01:59 AM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal it didnt give bman his shift manager role


[16-Jun-20 01:59 AM] Beartikal#9760
dk what u guys think


[16-Jun-20 02:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey ah ok i removed it


[16-Jun-20 02:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
i give those out manually like an old person


[16-Jun-20 02:00 AM] stacey#1000
lol


[16-Jun-20 02:01 AM] stacey#1000
i mean we get a lot of apps rn and ranking them is what takes a long time so the ranking bot would be very beneficial if possible


[16-Jun-20 02:01 AM] Beartikal#9760
what do u guys think about review-process in game then a bot auto rank when its passed


[16-Jun-20 02:01 AM] Beartikal#9760
so like u have toi play the roblox game still


[16-Jun-20 02:01 AM] stacey#1000
how would the review thing in game work


[16-Jun-20 02:01 AM] Beartikal#9760
so like when u join


[16-Jun-20 02:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
if ur guest theres a list of what you can apply for, your application status, history, etc


[16-Jun-20 02:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
if u apply then it says received


[16-Jun-20 02:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
application reader joins


[16-Jun-20 02:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
then it promps 1 by 1 the applications


[16-Jun-20 02:02 AM] Beartikal#9760
you can swipe right or left to either accept or decline


[16-Jun-20 02:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
then bot be like "lemme log who did dis"


[16-Jun-20 02:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
then bot be like


[16-Jun-20 02:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
**ranks**


[16-Jun-20 02:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
should be much more fluid


[16-Jun-20 02:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
not only does it provide status, but it logs who passed, etc.


[16-Jun-20 02:03 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can make it rlly advanced


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
so like would the applications still be sent to the application board?


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal can u add a !slock honor command


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
or something liek that


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
for the slocking system


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
thingy


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey no i can make it all-in-game


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
you review in the game


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
im not sure how that would work tho


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] bman#0435
so we have to join a game to read applications?


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
so like do we have to be in the server for someone to add in an app?


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
just a thought


[16-Jun-20 02:04 AM] Beartikal#9760
you have to be in server to review them


[16-Jun-20 02:05 AM] bman#0435
so basically interviews that isnt face to face


[16-Jun-20 02:05 AM] Beartikal#9760
no no this is aplicatiuon center


[16-Jun-20 02:05 AM] Beartikal#9760
not interviews


[16-Jun-20 02:05 AM] stacey#1000
I like the idea of like being able to send in applications from the hotel but im really use to it being sent to the trello


[16-Jun-20 02:05 AM] Beartikal#9760
yeh i have to think about iot


[16-Jun-20 02:05 AM] stacey#1000
is it possible for it to be sent to the trello board from the hotel?


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] stacey#1000
also would this mean we get the new interview questions that was decided on earlier when applications are updated?


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] Beartikal#9760
it is of course


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] bman#0435
idk because i thought trello linked games were removed from roblox


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] Beartikal#9760
i just thought that you guys dont like trello as it laggy with a lot of cards


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah but if there's 3 people reviewing then u need to give them their own batch


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] stacey#1000
The application board is really laggy because of the blacklisted people being on the same board


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] bman#0435
well i mean were laggy on the hr board but were not getting rid of that


[16-Jun-20 02:06 AM] bman#0435
lol


[16-Jun-20 02:07 AM] stacey#1000
if we made a separate board for blacklisted people it would be a lot better possibly


[16-Jun-20 02:07 AM] stacey#1000
there is like 1000+ cards of just blacklisted people on the application board


[16-Jun-20 02:07 AM] Beartikal#9760
:eeeee:


[16-Jun-20 02:07 AM] Beartikal#9760
trello trashy with a bunch of cards


[16-Jun-20 02:07 AM] stacey#1000
eliminating that by making a new board means not so much lag


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
Idc as long as we get a rank bot!!


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] bonnie591#0591

HOW DARE U


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal What do you think about the idea of making a blacklisted board?


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] Beartikal#9760
and apps?


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
YES


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 also no offence but can u make a legit inactive notice lol


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] stacey#1000
Yes please


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] Beartikal#9760
@stacey i mean sure i could make one


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal yes it'd be a good idea if you guys added a auto ranker for the passer board


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
@bman do I even have an inactive notice


[16-Jun-20 02:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
like a button that said rank all


[16-Jun-20 02:09 AM] Tattoblue#5828
on it


[16-Jun-20 02:09 AM] bman#0435
"Bonnie591 | Polk and Minn didn't do the checklists on time which has traumatised me. I can no longer be active for at least the next 2-5 years"


[16-Jun-20 02:09 AM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal I think that would just eliminate the lag on application board by not having blacklisted people on it anymore


[16-Jun-20 02:09 AM] stacey#1000
just a suggestion


[16-Jun-20 02:09 AM] bonnie591#0591

[16-Jun-20 02:23 AM] Beartikal#9760

That‚Äôs a bad idea @ethan;


[16-Jun-20 06:44 AM] stacey#1000
When former MRs are asking for a former MR lounge again- yeah sorry no too many formers have proven they don‚Äôt deserve one by either leaking or causing unneeded drama. Plus, I see no point in one.


[16-Jun-20 09:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
lol no former lounge how many times do we gotta say it


[16-Jun-20 09:44 AM] stacey#1000
Go look at the amount of tickets there is for it rn lmao


[16-Jun-20 09:46 AM] Tattoblue#5828
That‚Äôs unholy

[16-Jun-20 10:08 AM] Cam#5887
all of the Formers


[16-Jun-20 10:08 AM] Cam#5887
spammed the tickets


[16-Jun-20 10:08 AM] Cam#5887
its really annoying


[16-Jun-20 10:09 AM] Cam#5887
and all I am putting it "Thanks for your suggestion."


[16-Jun-20 10:09 AM] Cam#5887
Because, it's been denied


[16-Jun-20 10:09 AM] Cam#5887
and it's staying denied


[16-Jun-20 10:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
if a former makes another ticket requesting for the former MR lounge after their ticket has already been denied, just ticket blacklist them as it is abusing the purpose of the system


[16-Jun-20 10:17 AM] ethan;#0003
I gave c_aramels former mr role


[16-Jun-20 10:19 AM] ethan;#0003
and i gave wolfiexwyd former mr


[16-Jun-20 10:19 AM] ethan;#0003
but im holding off on giving purpley it because i dont know if he has done bad things before

[16-Jun-20 10:20 AM] Cam#5887

[16-Jun-20 10:20 AM] Cam#5887

[16-Jun-20 10:20 AM] ethan;#0003

[16-Jun-20 10:39 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

@KjRBLX https://i.imgur.com/A08SDaF.png for tickets like this, if they dont flat out ask the question you are allowed to close it because 75% of the time they never ask the question

#well he asked for talkative


[16-Jun-20 10:45 AM] bman#0435
i wouldve done the talkative thing then closed it


[16-Jun-20 10:47 AM] bman#0435
also for ones like these, close them. they need to be linked to a 30 day old roblox and discord account to get access, so they need to verify

asking to appeal


[16-Jun-20 05:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
idk what she did but in bans it says "tried to frame current mr"


[16-Jun-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
she wanted to photoshop evidence of a current mr to get her fired


[16-Jun-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
and attempted to bring up a situation from 2018 to get her fired


[16-Jun-20 05:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[16-Jun-20 05:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
her friend also was banned so i guess two peas in a pod


[16-Jun-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435

[16-Jun-20 05:58 PM] bman#0435
:)


[16-Jun-20 06:14 PM] courtney#5125
if it's of any importance, at my interview session, Artyphos unnamed himself and unnamed all after the grammar test. i just whispered him and asked him to please not do that, he never responded

[16-Jun-20 06:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So timezones are restricted to mrs and talkative is restricted to non employees


[16-Jun-20 06:18 PM] bman#0435
correct


[16-Jun-20 06:18 PM] ethan;#0003
Yes


[16-Jun-20 06:18 PM] bman#0435

[16-Jun-20 06:18 PM] bman#0435
someone gotta warn arty asap


[16-Jun-20 06:19 PM] bman#0435
this aint 2016/2017 üôÑ


[16-Jun-20 06:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So Art strikes again, in less than a day?


[16-Jun-20 06:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well then


[16-Jun-20 06:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean maybe he was just trying to be helpful.


[16-Jun-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
either way its admin abuse


[16-Jun-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[16-Jun-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
he also shouldnt be attempting to do candys job for her


[16-Jun-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
candy is fully capable of hosting on her own, hence her promotion to shift


[16-Jun-20 06:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
You want me to let him know?


[16-Jun-20 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
Someone went thought the rules with arty right?

[16-Jun-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 yup stacey and i did. also admin abuse is literally a known rule so


[16-Jun-20 06:28 PM] bman#0435

[16-Jun-20 06:28 PM] bman#0435

Was there a list of commands considered AA commands?


[16-Jun-20 06:33 PM] bman#0435
regardless of there being a list, he shouldnt use commands with ‚Äúall‚Äù in it nor should he be trying to do candys job for her. however, these r commands he is permitted to use.

this isn't a first-time thing


[16-Jun-20 07:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
ive dealt with a lot of drama since v1


[16-Jun-20 07:23 PM] Cam#5887
yeah of course, i feel like our jobs are a lot of drama


[16-Jun-20 07:24 PM] Cam#5887
cause they are üòÇ


[16-Jun-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760

[16-Jun-20 07:24 PM] Cam#5887
definitely


[16-Jun-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
naive if you expect no drama


[16-Jun-20 07:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
this is just a little "more" drama than usual


[16-Jun-20 07:25 PM] Cam#5887
yea


[16-Jun-20 07:27 PM] Beartikal#9760

@High Rank come to the meeting on Saturday with at least 5 recommendations on to make this group better.. we will discuss these topics and approve them one by one.. I want actual things we can change overnight

{Reactions}
thumbs_up (5) 

[16-Jun-20 07:33 PM] impact#0297
Cam, I still want 5 recommendations from you and I will mention them at the meeting for you @Cam


[16-Jun-20 07:34 PM] Cam#5887
ofc


[16-Jun-20 07:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
as a dev i got my fair share of things to make the group better, im going to be simplifying the work HRs have to do in interview, training, etc.


[16-Jun-20 07:35 PM] impact#0297
If you can't do 5 recommendations, you will be very well noted for future reference.


[16-Jun-20 07:35 PM] ethan;#0003
at 12 pm?


[16-Jun-20 07:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
cyto if you want you can put it in announcements or somewhere where it stays


[16-Jun-20 07:37 PM] impact#0297
i'll remind on thursday


[16-Jun-20 07:37 PM] impact#0297
but other than that, if they can't see that notification, they didn't see this chat


[16-Jun-20 07:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Err I'll be away from my desk, but I'll try to come up with 5 things.


[16-Jun-20 08:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I know I already asked a question about talkative role, but what if they're role 3?


[16-Jun-20 08:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They just wait until they become a staff?


[16-Jun-20 08:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I don't think awaiting trainee's can talk in general discussion, so you can give them talkative role. @KjRBLX i think some awaiting trainees already have talkative


[16-Jun-20 08:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ahh I didn't think to check if 3s have the role...


[16-Jun-20 08:37 PM] bman#0435
when u say ?info @ it shows u the roles they have


[16-Jun-20 08:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean I know what roles he has but I asked if 3s can get talk but I didn't think to check if any other 3s had the role to know if 3s could have the role


[16-Jun-20 08:39 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont see a point why they cant talk in general if we allow


[16-Jun-20 08:39 PM] ethan;#0003
but i dont think we allow it


[16-Jun-20 08:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It doesn't, I checked permissions to see if 3s were in the list


[16-Jun-20 08:40 PM] katie#0200
we do allow trainees to get the talkative role we removed talking perms from rank 3 because people kept making alts and becoming a trainee to bypass their discord ban, easily access the chat to troll and stuff


[16-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435

to be honest idk if im thinking straight right now but why not give former mrs a lounge for now and see how it goes, the formers that are toxic and create drama don‚Äôt have the former role anyways so we can just control who has access to the chat

Its a video..sleeping bag, wall, glitch through when jumping because sleeping bag is slightly on the other side of the wall.


[16-Jun-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
send the video to baby and bear, i thought sleeping bags werent able to be placed inside the hotel


[16-Jun-20 08:59 PM] courtney#5125
@katie yeah i think it could be something interesting to try out. obviously ive never been a former, but if i was, im sure it would be nice to connect with people that know about being an mr/hr. i can see some drama happening with it, but not all of the formers are "toxic" people. most of them have good intentions and probably dont plan on abusing the channel


[16-Jun-20 08:59 PM] katie#0200
yup agreed, i don‚Äôt see an issue with giving them a chance, if they ruin it for themselves then that‚Äôs that but i think itd be nice to see how that goes


[16-Jun-20 09:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
How long ago was the sleeping bag restriction implemented? Was it before Jun 7?


[16-Jun-20 09:00 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i saw like 10 tickets asking for it today. at least if we gave it a shot, formers and hrs would know the benefits or issues that come with it


[16-Jun-20 09:03 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[16-Jun-20 09:05 PM] katie#0200
@KjRBLX sleeping bags were implemented with the 1M update which happened on May 3rd I believe (can‚Äôt quite remember the exact date) and I suppose the bar wasn‚Äôt blocked off as well from the sleeping bags since sleeping bags can be placed inside the bar if im correct, so ya that needs to be fixed lol


[16-Jun-20 09:06 PM] bman#0435
im sorry but i gotta disagree on a former lounge. even if they seem to be desperate for one, they will bring up past issues and will most likely discuss topics that were discussed in sl while they were employed. also, drama is just BOUND to happen, i mean half the mrs that r begging for a former lounge r ones that were banned and appealed...


[16-Jun-20 09:08 PM] courtney#5125
thats also a really fair point. theres surely going to be plenty of drama


[16-Jun-20 09:08 PM] courtney#5125
ive seen former mrs ask for it that dont have any major past issues, but a good portion do


[16-Jun-20 09:08 PM] katie#0200
if they create drama we can just remove their role because that shows they weren‚Äôt responsible enough to not cause drama which is clearly stated in the rules


[16-Jun-20 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
A former lounge is just overall not a good idea, it was decided against many times. Reason being, majority of them leak and cause drama. Plus, they already have their own former discord server supposedly so...?


[16-Jun-20 09:09 PM] bman#0435
we shouldnt have to remove the role they earned because they think they were entitled enough to have their own chat


[16-Jun-20 09:09 PM] katie#0200
we can remove the lounge if it gets out of hand but I don‚Äôt see an issue with giving it a try at least


[16-Jun-20 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
I mean we could try it, I personally just feel it's a bad idea.


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
if yall wanna try, go ahead. im just fully against it because i already know what to expect


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
we literally had at least like 5 mrs appeal their role...


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
A lot of the formers asking for it were either fired, or have been a part of drama as well.


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
^


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no former lounge


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
no


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
It's really just not a good idea.


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
at least like 5% resigned peacefully, such as dreamie


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
It will cause more drama.


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Actually


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] katie#0200
ya im not rlly expecting the best from this either but we never know until we try and not all former mrs are like that some deserve it lol


[16-Jun-20 09:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Maybe let‚Äôs try it


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] courtney#5125
yeah true but same as katie, i dont reallyyy think theres that much harm in trying


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
I mean yeah we can try it and if it goes bad we can remove it.


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But how about leakers


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] bman#0435
if u guys wanna monitor that chat then u guys can, im not trying to intervene their situations they can contain in their own dms because they think that chat will make them immune to rules


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
I think the ones that were fired and heavily involved with drama in the past should not get access to it right away.


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like if they talk about MR+ only stuff it might be leaked. We have to have a rule against that stuff


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] bman#0435
some of them dont even follow our rules and r toxic in general, so


[16-Jun-20 09:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@stacey ya that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt have former role


[16-Jun-20 09:12 PM] katie#0200
oh yeah we should make it a rule not to mention classified info


[16-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
well if we remove their role for something non-leaking related, theyre still in the server. u dont expect them to show backlash?


[16-Jun-20 09:12 PM] katie#0200
if they do something bad enough to lose their role then that‚Äôs on them


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
@bman right to what you said about them causing drama in general discussion. if they cant handle themselves in general, theyre not going to be able to handle themselves in a chat that gives them the opportunity to do the same or worse in a chat strictly for them


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
Alright I am open to giving it a try.


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] katie#0200
yea agreed with candy


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
but i really dont see the harm in trying it out


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
But, the second it goes bad it's gone.


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] katie#0200
mhm


[16-Jun-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
yes


[16-Jun-20 09:14 PM] bman#0435
gl with that, just expect drama to appear within SECONDS of the chats creation. these formers r too predictable at this point


[16-Jun-20 09:14 PM] courtney#5125
its true that there are pros and cons ^^  but if we dont try then we'll never know


[16-Jun-20 09:14 PM] bman#0435
also on another note, is roblox acting slow for anyone


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] courtney#5125
yeah im getting a bad gateway


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] bman#0435
i cant open up a game


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] katie#0200
i don‚Äôt have much faith in most of the former mrs either but u never know until u try like candy said


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] courtney#5125
i cant even access roblox itself loll


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] katie#0200
o I haven‚Äôt been on roblox in ages


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] katie#0200
discord and roblox keeps crashing for me tho


[16-Jun-20 09:15 PM] katie#0200
it‚Äôs been doing this for like a week


[16-Jun-20 09:16 PM] katie#0200
idk if it‚Äôs just me


[16-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
oop roblox is completely down


[16-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
"The service is unavailable"


[16-Jun-20 09:16 PM] katie#0200
oh rip


[16-Jun-20 09:17 PM] courtney#5125
yeah katie. we do have a lot of former mrs that have malicious intentions and only want to create issues and drama. but we also have plenty who want to use a former lounge to communicate with others that understand more abt stuff theyre possibly talking about. there are formers that have a good background and resigned with no hard feelings towards the group


[16-Jun-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
Alright if we are discussing a former lounge, we could add a vote on it to see who all agrees and disagrees.


[16-Jun-20 09:18 PM] courtney#5125
^


[16-Jun-20 09:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ew a former mr lounge


[16-Jun-20 09:18 PM] katie#0200
yeah agreed, we should inform the founders and ryan too since I believe they r discussing it idk


[16-Jun-20 09:18 PM] bman#0435
i think we need baby and bear approval on having votes now üôÉ


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] courtney#5125
has a former lounge been discussed a lot in the past or has it only been truly considered a few times like this?


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] bman#0435
yup


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] bman#0435
been declined a bunch


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] courtney#5125
i gave two options


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] courtney#5125
OH ok


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it‚Äôs been brought up many times before


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder Good to add a vote on the idea of a former MR lounge? Or do I just add votes without approval, just want to clarify.


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] bman#0435
no one ever agreed on it


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
There‚Äôs just so many toxic former mrs


[16-Jun-20 09:19 PM] bman#0435
because we already know their intentions


[16-Jun-20 09:20 PM] courtney#5125
yeah a lot of them do have bad intentions but there are also a lot that dont have hard feelings towards the group or its members, and have a pretty good background


[16-Jun-20 09:20 PM] katie#0200
yeah I mean with this whole reforms thing itd be cool to give them a chance because we never know how it‚Äôll go until we try and if it gets out of hand we can just remove the lounge if necessary


[16-Jun-20 09:21 PM] bman#0435
well also, former mr lounge could be a topic being discussed within refroms and is something we wont know of until announced


[16-Jun-20 09:21 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[16-Jun-20 09:22 PM] katie#0200
that‚Äôs true, let‚Äôs just wait and see what baby and bear think


[16-Jun-20 09:23 PM] courtney#5125
yess okay agreed :)


[16-Jun-20 09:26 PM] courtney#5125
off topic but why are ppl wanting security to be able to use commands like view and chatlogs üò≥


[16-Jun-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
they also wanna fly and have tasers


[16-Jun-20 09:27 PM] bman#0435
:RollEyes:


[16-Jun-20 09:27 PM] courtney#5125
JFLAKJFLA TRUE


[16-Jun-20 09:27 PM] courtney#5125
might as well promote all of the security guards to heads if were gonna do that :/


[16-Jun-20 09:27 PM] courtney#5125
like ig i can see why they might want that but i really cant see a good outcome to that


[16-Jun-20 09:28 PM] katie#0200
also i just wanted to add - this is my opinion but i feel like now is the right time to give former mrs a chance with a former mr lounge, our opinions on formers are mainly that they‚Äôre toxic and cause drama all the time which is true for quite a few formers but that‚Äôs only because we have to deal with them; it‚Äôs not like we have to deal with good behaviour, we only see the bad things former mrs do and give all of them that label. im not saying all formers are good lol we all know they aren‚Äôt but it‚Äôs unfair to those few decent formers who resigned without causing any trouble or having ill intent towards the group so maybe giving them a lounge just to see how it goes wouldn‚Äôt hurt


[16-Jun-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
might as well add a point system too XDDDDD


[16-Jun-20 09:28 PM] bman#0435
if theres only a few decent formers y cant they just make a gc with each other


[16-Jun-20 09:29 PM] katie#0200
they can but it‚Äôs obviously not the same and if those toxic formers want to be part of the former lounge then they can change their behaviour over time to access it


[16-Jun-20 09:29 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i agree katie. super good point there


[16-Jun-20 09:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean I get that not all of them are toxic, but I can guarantee you problems will arise. I mean guess we could try it but i don‚Äôt like the idea of having one


[16-Jun-20 09:30 PM] bman#0435
^


[16-Jun-20 09:30 PM] bman#0435
they dont even have the chat and theyre toxic...


[16-Jun-20 09:30 PM] katie#0200
yeah i get that. It‚Äôs just that we haven‚Äôt given it a chance yet and other groups do it I believe


[16-Jun-20 09:30 PM] courtney#5125
without a doubt problems will arise, weve had issues with toxic formers for a long time. but there are still ones that resigned on good terms and dont have hate towards the group


[16-Jun-20 09:30 PM] bman#0435
also i doubt the last thing baby and bear want us to deal with is MORE drama


[16-Jun-20 09:30 PM] courtney#5125
if there are major issues and it gets out of control then former lounge is taken away


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] katie#0200
If we give them something to work towards (ie the chat so they‚Äôll fix their behaviour to access the chat - as in a reward for good behaviour) then that‚Äôll probably reduce a lot of their bad behaviour


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] katie#0200
idk if I said that right it‚Äôs 3:30 am


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] courtney#5125
@bman true. if its implemented, it should wait at least until more stuff with reforms is announced


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] courtney#5125
LOL


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] courtney#5125
no no ur making valid points here


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] bman#0435
@katie dont pull a min and say random stuff at 3am :PensiveCold:


[16-Jun-20 09:31 PM] katie#0200
I‚Äôm sure baby and bear want us to sort it out instead of constantly having a battle with former mrs about their behaviour and stuff idk


[16-Jun-20 09:32 PM] katie#0200
omg i swear im doing that üòî


[16-Jun-20 09:32 PM] bman#0435
we declined their request for the channel on multiple occasions, so i dont see it as a "battle"


[16-Jun-20 09:32 PM] katie#0200
ever since min did that im thinking about what I say at these sorta times LOL


[16-Jun-20 09:32 PM] bman#0435

omg in suggestions, someone asked for a former lr lounge-


[16-Jun-20 09:36 PM] katie#0200
LOL


[16-Jun-20 09:36 PM] courtney#5125
how would that work if lrs resign and come back the next day tho....


[16-Jun-20 09:37 PM] katie#0200
loool imagine if we added that and then every lr resigned so they could access the chat üíÄ


[16-Jun-20 09:37 PM] courtney#5125
not to mention.. ya just forgot abt general?


[16-Jun-20 09:37 PM] katie#0200
exactly


[16-Jun-20 09:37 PM] katie#0200
rip general everyone wants to replace it with some other new channel :(


[16-Jun-20 09:38 PM] courtney#5125
we just need to make a general discussion for each rank at this point


[16-Jun-20 09:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Anyway, the Real or Fake Mango is requesting Honor Memeber. I can't check their linked because Bloxlink seems to down, but I'm guessing Roblox is down.


[16-Jun-20 09:38 PM] courtney#5125
lets make a cb lounge next while were at it


[16-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
o i doubt mango is getting honor lmfao


[16-Jun-20 09:39 PM] katie#0200
lol


[16-Jun-20 09:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I was trynna check if it was fake so I possibly go ahead and close the ticket.


[16-Jun-20 09:39 PM] katie#0200
verified lounge and talkative lounge too because why not


[16-Jun-20 09:43 PM] courtney#5125
sounds like a perfect and very crowded discord server ü§©


[16-Jun-20 09:44 PM] bman#0435
the fact that cory wants admin at the ints and trainings


[16-Jun-20 09:44 PM] bman#0435
im


[16-Jun-20 09:44 PM] courtney#5125
does he mean seniors receive automatic admin?


[16-Jun-20 09:45 PM] bman#0435
yup


[16-Jun-20 09:47 PM] courtney#5125
ohh dang


[16-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Unt


[16-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he wants automatic admin


[16-Jun-20 09:47 PM] courtney#5125
honestly a lot of these suggestions im seeing are really good, but a lot of them are also just repeating eachother


[16-Jun-20 09:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i think mod is fine


[16-Jun-20 09:47 PM] courtney#5125
yeahhh


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
the fact that maddy admin abuses constantly with moderator makes this an easy decision


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
üíÄ


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] katie#0200
oh god about madi


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
o no


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] courtney#5125
like i get if its for banning purposes, but youd still have to ask the hr host for perms to ban anyways. if ur gonna do that, might as well just keep the mod and ask the hr to ban for you


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] katie#0200
i made an announcement about her a couple of days ago i think and we didn‚Äôt rlly do a vote on it i think I fell asleep


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
u did?


[16-Jun-20 09:48 PM] katie#0200
about being unprofessional and distracting at trainings


[16-Jun-20 09:49 PM] katie#0200
i completely forgot


[16-Jun-20 09:49 PM] katie#0200
yeah on the 10th of June


[16-Jun-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
ohhh


[16-Jun-20 09:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean really the only reason why we give admin now is so that they can mod their MRs but bear talked about giving rank 11s and below mod so we don‚Äôt need to go to each server and admin each host


[16-Jun-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
regardless she gets suspended


[16-Jun-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
would be third warning as senior >> suspended


[16-Jun-20 09:51 PM] katie#0200
yea. I think we should do a proper vote on that just so everyone knows what her situation is anyways


[16-Jun-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
gotta get baby and bear approval for a vote first üôÉ


[16-Jun-20 09:51 PM] katie#0200
yes ü§ò


[16-Jun-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
honestly, i feel like that rule is so tedious...


[16-Jun-20 09:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@bman I think you‚Äôre able to put up a vote, only thing is it can be overruled by a higher rank


[16-Jun-20 09:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
although it says actions against another hr


[16-Jun-20 09:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
maybe not


[16-Jun-20 09:55 PM] bman#0435
o i may have read the rule wrong and combined it lol

[16-Jun-20 09:58 PM] courtney#5125
i havent paid attention to it recently, but does the GUI at the top of the screen at the hotel that lets you teleport shout housekeeping/reception? or does it still only do snack?


[16-Jun-20 09:58 PM] bman#0435
just snack


[16-Jun-20 09:58 PM] courtney#5125

i recently banned her for bypassing at the hotel


[16-Jun-20 10:06 PM] stacey#1000
She was blacklisted for being heavily involved in a tea server. Also she was legit trying to convince a senior to leak to her and being like "omg you can get me promoted on my alt account."


[16-Jun-20 10:06 PM] bman#0435
not sure what her discord is


[16-Jun-20 10:06 PM] stacey#1000
I blacklisted her.


[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] bman#0435

[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] impact#0297

[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] stacey#1000
She was involved in encouraging drama, leaking, and trying to get MR on an alt account.


[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] stacey#1000
So, I blacklisted her. :))


[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] courtney#5125

[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] impact#0297

[16-Jun-20 10:07 PM] stacey#1000
Like....she was trying to get a senior manager to say what was happening in staff lounge and saying "You can tell me i wont tell!"


[16-Jun-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
No thanks she aint appealing she was just blacklisted like a month ago.

[16-Jun-20 10:19 PM] courtney#5125
soo should our ideas be strictly based on things like improving teamwork, rules, and stuff like that, or can they ALSO be about how to improve the gameplay? or does it really not matter


[16-Jun-20 10:20 PM] courtney#5125
i have kind of a mixture of both but if were only focusing on one or the other, ill save certain ones for a later date


[16-Jun-20 10:20 PM] bman#0435
ryan said just making the group better


[16-Jun-20 10:20 PM] bman#0435

@impact what time will the meeting be


[17-Jun-20 06:52 AM] anna#0004
^^


[17-Jun-20 07:19 AM] stacey#1000
Found out I get Saturday off and work Sunday instead, so I can go.


[17-Jun-20 07:49 AM] anna#0004
for future reference, aamirkklol and madi are pretty immature around each other at sessions


[17-Jun-20 07:59 AM] stacey#1000
Yes, Maddy was suspended not too long ago for admin abuse at the tc and she let aamirk come to trainings really late as well. Need to keep an eye on them both.


[17-Jun-20 07:59 AM] stacey#1000
They are good friends but need to remain professional at sessions, which both have had issues with.


[17-Jun-20 08:09 AM] anna#0004
Yep


[17-Jun-20 08:10 AM] stacey#1000
@anna what were they doing at your session earlier?


[17-Jun-20 08:12 AM] anna#0004
At the beginning of my interviews i have the mrs stay in the office area and come out when the grammar test starts, when i came back from modding they were playing about with the door (opening and closing, getting stuck in it etc) and both had to be reminded to to go back in


[17-Jun-20 08:15 AM] stacey#1000
@anna I see. Anytime someone doesn‚Äôt follow by your PMs you can warn them as a reminder they should be professional and following instructions during sessions, especially if there interviewees there.


[17-Jun-20 08:16 AM] stacey#1000
If you reminded them it‚Äôs all good.


[17-Jun-20 08:16 AM] anna#0004
Got it! Thank you :)


[17-Jun-20 10:13 AM] ethan;#0003
@anna ive noticed that also


[17-Jun-20 10:13 AM] ethan;#0003
it seems more of mirk pressuring maddy into doing stuff


[17-Jun-20 10:14 AM] anna#0004
For suree, when he was inactive she was a lot more mature


[17-Jun-20 10:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Polk I think your server was raided lol

[17-Jun-20 12:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Oop nevermind I think it‚Äôs a fan server or something


[17-Jun-20 12:09 PM] Polk#1596
oh i think ik what you're talking about


[17-Jun-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
somebody made a server called "polk community" and invited me to it, it was a surprise for my third year here at bloxton


[17-Jun-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
and he started hiring actual staff because the server got many members


[17-Jun-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
but i left, i dont trust being in the server


[17-Jun-20 12:13 PM] bman#0435

well isn‚Äôt that something


[17-Jun-20 01:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Is there any reason as to why he was flying


[17-Jun-20 01:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Or was he just flying for the sake of flying?


[17-Jun-20 01:07 PM] katie#0200
apparently they were taking a picture


[17-Jun-20 01:07 PM] Cam#5887
uhm


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
Was it after the session?


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] katie#0200
mhm I believe so


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
mango probs came after seeing new honors get it such as Mallory and fred


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmmm if it was after the session, I'd leave a verbal reminder that only HRs can fly


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
since he obviously wasn't doing it with intention to abuse


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
he probs thought it was allowed


[17-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
due to it being after the session


[17-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
it's confusing to be honest I wish it wasn't allowed for them to use it


[17-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
that way even if they wanted to


[17-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
they couldnt


[17-Jun-20 01:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Can't you disable the command in roblox studio


[17-Jun-20 01:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
for moderators


[17-Jun-20 01:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
like u disabled btools for admins at the hotel


[17-Jun-20 01:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
maybe I'll have to check


[17-Jun-20 01:11 PM] Beartikal#9760
hopefully it can be done ez


[17-Jun-20 01:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah


[17-Jun-20 01:14 PM] bman#0435
that was after ints were done thi


[17-Jun-20 01:14 PM] bman#0435
tho


[17-Jun-20 01:14 PM] bman#0435
@katie @courtney


[17-Jun-20 01:14 PM] bman#0435
u can see they were at the edge taking a picture


[17-Jun-20 01:15 PM] bman#0435
o u said that


[17-Jun-20 01:15 PM] bman#0435
LOL


[17-Jun-20 01:15 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal can i give squishy the yt role


[17-Jun-20 01:18 PM] Cam#5887
@Beartikal it‚Äôs really easy to disable those commands


[17-Jun-20 01:18 PM] Cam#5887
especially with basic admin essentials


[17-Jun-20 01:30 PM] ethan;#0003
@courtney was interviews over


[17-Jun-20 01:33 PM] courtney#5125
yeah they were. they were trying to take a picture it sounds like


[17-Jun-20 01:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@courtney I would give a strict warning and remind him not to use those commands


[17-Jun-20 01:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It looks like the sessions was over so no need for a suspension


[17-Jun-20 01:58 PM] courtney#5125
ah, i wasnt there when he did it. a head reported that in dms


[17-Jun-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
@courtney do u know who the host was


[17-Jun-20 02:03 PM] courtney#5125
no, i'll ask who sent it to me


[17-Jun-20 02:14 PM] courtney#5125
@bman the host was imag1native


[17-Jun-20 02:14 PM] bman#0435
o oof ok


[17-Jun-20 02:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@Beartikal do we have to get perms for that kinda stuff by you guys to give someone youtuber role, or as long as they have 1K they qualify for it


[17-Jun-20 02:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
no as long as they got 1k they qualify


[17-Jun-20 02:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Punishment for advertising?


[17-Jun-20 07:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
3 day suspension?


[17-Jun-20 07:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, what do I do if I have no way send the termination letter?


[17-Jun-20 07:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'll do two days.


[17-Jun-20 07:53 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@KjRBLX yeah 2 days is fine, if you have no way to send the termination letter then its fine you dont have to


[17-Jun-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435
isnt 2 days below minimum suspension tho...?


[17-Jun-20 08:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
is there a minimum?


[17-Jun-20 08:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
if there is make it 2 days lol


[17-Jun-20 08:02 PM] bman#0435
i was told when i was promoted that suspensions r 3-5 days


[17-Jun-20 08:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
typically but theres no official rule stating that dont think


[17-Jun-20 08:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
not by me anyway


[17-Jun-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
o ok


[17-Jun-20 08:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ü§∑


[17-Jun-20 08:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well in the training one suspending reason aka Lack of Grammar I guess can be possible for a under 3 day suspension, because it says "No more than 3 days, consider issuing a warning instead"


[17-Jun-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
oh


[17-Jun-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
u may need to announce that to the mrs, we agreed for full transparency with them and have been announcing every mr termination to them


[17-Jun-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal


[17-Jun-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
also what exactly did he say?


[17-Jun-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
mrs r confused since they said hes been asleep


[17-Jun-20 09:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
no, if he comes or DMs, just say to him the announcement notice


[17-Jun-20 09:06 PM] bman#0435
wut


[17-Jun-20 09:09 PM] bman#0435
so no announcement to the mrs...?


[17-Jun-20 09:10 PM] Beartikal#9760
not necessary


[17-Jun-20 09:15 PM] bman#0435
did he at least get a dm of his termination?


[17-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
and i think an announcement to the mrs is necessary


[17-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
weve been doing it for past terminations


[17-Jun-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435
dont see a reason not to do it for this one and leave them all curious


[17-Jun-20 09:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
one of the BODs that are friends with him can DM him.


[17-Jun-20 09:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
What exactly did he say? @Beartikal


[17-Jun-20 09:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
he was trash talking and shading our decision of the reforms, literally trash talking baby directly in front of him. This is not the behavior we expect of an MR.


[17-Jun-20 09:30 PM] bman#0435
do u have screenshots


[17-Jun-20 09:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
i do, however, i don't think its necessary to share them. He knows what he did.


[17-Jun-20 09:31 PM] bman#0435
but we dont


[17-Jun-20 09:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If a 3 is causing trouble, should we just demote them? https://trello.com/c/HGki6frd/203723-pxbgamer-3-rude-to-others


[17-Jun-20 09:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
why do you need to, i'm telling you what he did.


[17-Jun-20 09:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
@KjRBLX let me check


[17-Jun-20 09:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
Yes @KjRBLX


[17-Jun-20 09:32 PM] bman#0435
well i mean u terminated an mr and we dont even have proof of it, i mean a card of the termination with proof would at least have to go on the hr board


[17-Jun-20 09:33 PM] bman#0435
by we i mean the hr team, but u and baby do


[17-Jun-20 09:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wait bear


[17-Jun-20 09:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
that's fine, i'll create a card ig.


[17-Jun-20 09:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Just to be sure, when I say demote from 3, I mean fire..


[17-Jun-20 09:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yes or no?


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah, they shouldn't be a staff if they say things like that as a 3.


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
you can fire them, that's fine @KjRBLX


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
they can reapply anyway


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright, got it.


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah, if they're outright rude like that then it's okay to fire them because we wouldn't want them having a rank


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
in the announcement, you said he can be reinstated back to his original rank, original rank as in MR rank if he appeals and understands not to do it again? @Beartikal


[17-Jun-20 09:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yes bloo


[17-Jun-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
Yes, under the circumstance that he doesn't do it again. @Bloo_Berriez


[17-Jun-20 09:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
why didn‚Äôt you guys just warn him then


[17-Jun-20 09:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
I wanted the action of putting to Rank 1 to have weight.


[17-Jun-20 09:38 PM] bman#0435
does that mean that the non-staff members that were banned for the same reason may also appeal before the 30 day limit?


[17-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
well i feel like putting him to rank 1 immediately was a bit harsh... i think if u suspended him until he wrote u guys an pology and got reranked then wouldve been nice


[17-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
because now if we rehire him when he appeals, former mrs will attack and when i say that i mean ATTACK us about getting their ranks back


[17-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
i mean, it happened when yall did it to saab


[17-Jun-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
like when she was reinstated her senior rank in 2019 i think for like not even 10 minutes


[17-Jun-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can do 2 | Suspended, however if I see any other behavior he won't be warned again. he can write a written apology and get the rank back instantly.


[17-Jun-20 09:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I agree with a suspension @Beartikal


[17-Jun-20 09:56 PM] Tattoblue#5828
How long? @Beartikal

ban sessions for seniors


[17-Jun-20 10:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes GM+ can host


[17-Jun-20 10:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What happens at a ban session?


[17-Jun-20 10:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Or SM can host with an GM since they don‚Äôt have super admin


[17-Jun-20 10:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
If the MB board is full of bans you can have seniors help


[17-Jun-20 10:10 PM] bman#0435
seniors basically get admin and go through bans on mb and overflow board


[17-Jun-20 10:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Oh lol


[17-Jun-20 10:11 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[17-Jun-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX are you on the ban request overflow board?

CB ban document?


[17-Jun-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
There is a list of CBs for MRs+ only rn. It‚Äôs pinged in staff announcements


[17-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
Not going to be for LRs because then all the CBs will see it and like have a goal to try to get on the list and it would cause more problems


[17-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
So it‚Äôs for MRs+ only


[17-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
If you notice anyone that needs to be added to the list lmk

@bman they made a request to us, but it is not being considered


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
aw why not


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
too small?


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] bman#0435
o ok, i assumed that the applications placed on that board would be ones to consider


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
no i believe those are just requests made to us


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
correct


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] ethan;#0003
are we still banning people for using "vr exploit" even though it isnt an exploit


[17-Jun-20 11:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
vr exploit?


[17-Jun-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
roblox added vr


[17-Jun-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
but games that arent compatible they need to edit the game script to use the vr


[17-Jun-20 11:30 PM] ethan;#0003
so its somewhat an exploit


[17-Jun-20 11:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[18-Jun-20 12:02 AM] ethan;#0003
@babymariobebe can we do move the perm denied list off the application board?


[18-Jun-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
Do you all ban for the word "retarded" being bypassing at the hotel?


[18-Jun-20 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
Because itself I dont really view it as a swear word and people get banned for it. So just want to know your opinions on it


[18-Jun-20 12:08 AM] courtney#5125
i honestly havent seen the word for a long time, but i never really considered it a swear word. personally, i think if someone says it, they should be asked not to, since its definitely an insult. i have seen ppl get banned for it multiple times tho, and i really dont think its super fair. most people dont view it as a curse word, just a rude thing to say. if ppl are saying it as an insult to someone else, they should be asked to stop and warn for it in my opinion


[18-Jun-20 12:08 AM] stacey#1000
@babymariobebe What do you think?


[18-Jun-20 12:09 AM] Beartikal#9760
if its not tagged by Roblox then no


[18-Jun-20 12:10 AM] Beartikal#9760
it CAN be taken as Disrespect/Trolling but NOT as a Bypass


[18-Jun-20 12:10 AM] stacey#1000
Ill send an example


[18-Jun-20 12:11 AM] courtney#5125
yeah I was just speaking with someone earlier today about their ban, and they were banned just for saying this:

@Beartikal is it 5 grammar strikes now? and was it announced? Someone said in questions it‚Äôs still 3


[18-Jun-20 12:32 AM] KjRBLX#2053
First session: Me = Nervous ngl


[18-Jun-20 12:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
no its still 3, but the commas, periods and small things dont count as strikes but count as reminders to the staff


[18-Jun-20 12:50 AM] ethan;#0003
is the application board very laggy for anyone?


[18-Jun-20 12:55 AM] Beartikal#9760
it been like that


[18-Jun-20 12:56 AM] bman#0435
@Beartikal i dont recall reforms ever coming to a conclusion, so does that mean reforms r still ongoing? and if so then what else r u guys planning to do and when will reforms end overall


[18-Jun-20 12:56 AM] bman#0435
if u have any of that info


[18-Jun-20 12:56 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
I think that‚Äôs what the meeting is about on Saturday


[18-Jun-20 12:56 AM] bman#0435
i thought the meeting was abt the 5 things we wanted to change


[18-Jun-20 12:56 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
idk


[18-Jun-20 12:57 AM] bman#0435
but overall, itd still be nice to know now instead of wait a few more days


[18-Jun-20 01:11 AM] courtney#5125
mod asked me why he was suspended, so can i tell him that he can receive his mr rank back if he writes a meaningful apology?


[18-Jun-20 01:15 AM] stacey#1000
He should've been sent a suspension letter


[18-Jun-20 01:15 AM] stacey#1000
but if he can get his rank back if he apologizes yes


[18-Jun-20 01:15 AM] stacey#1000
bear said if he apologized and doesnt do it again he can


[18-Jun-20 01:15 AM] courtney#5125
okay, i'll tell him that


[18-Jun-20 01:15 AM] courtney#5125
are we sure he was sent a letter tho? i assume he wouldnt be asking if he was sent one. not sure thoughh


[18-Jun-20 01:16 AM] stacey#1000
I dont believe he was


[18-Jun-20 01:16 AM] stacey#1000
but yes anytime an MR is suspended or terminated they should be sent a termination or suspension notice to inform them of the situation


[18-Jun-20 01:17 AM] courtney#5125
yeahhh :/


[18-Jun-20 01:17 AM] bman#0435

He can be unbanned and ranked back


[18-Jun-20 02:02 AM] courtney#5125

[18-Jun-20 02:02 AM] stacey#1000

"Imagine yourself being blamed for something you never did, **__and it happened at school.__**"


[18-Jun-20 10:15 AM] Polk#1596
"My brother decided to come into my room and go threw my stuff"


[18-Jun-20 10:16 AM] Polk#1596
if she said two different things i doubt she is telling the truth


[18-Jun-20 10:16 AM] Polk#1596
like i doubt she has a room at school and her brother is somehow in there when they have an age gap


[18-Jun-20 10:17 AM] KjRBLX#2053
She says she didnt do anything but then says she its her fault


[18-Jun-20 10:18 AM] anna#0004
Lol fr, I got that doc from the ban appeals channel and she just dmed me that exact appeal probably because she‚Äôs tried it on everyone else


[18-Jun-20 10:18 AM] KjRBLX#2053
(Ariana is the reason she got banned.)


[18-Jun-20 10:18 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Is she speaking in third person?


[18-Jun-20 10:19 AM] anna#0004
LOL I was thinking that


[18-Jun-20 10:19 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I got confused like 3 times


[18-Jun-20 10:21 AM] KjRBLX#2053

[18-Jun-20 11:20 AM] bonnie591#0591
@anna isnt this their second offense


[18-Jun-20 11:21 AM] anna#0004

[18-Jun-20 11:21 AM] bonnie591#0591

[18-Jun-20 11:22 AM] bonnie591#0591

[18-Jun-20 11:23 AM] anna#0004
Uh, Katie reported it here yesterday I believe, not sure who was involved with that one


[18-Jun-20 11:23 AM] anna#0004
or if anyone warned


[18-Jun-20 11:25 AM] bonnie591#0591
Meh just suspend for 3 days and they should come back from suspension and not do it again


[18-Jun-20 11:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank Any objections to a 3 day suspension?


[18-Jun-20 11:26 AM] Cam#5887

She thinks we are that gullible


[18-Jun-20 11:44 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Should we make a statement saying not to do anything that might be abusive after events?


[18-Jun-20 11:49 AM] Cam#5887
5 days


[18-Jun-20 11:50 AM] Cam#5887

[18-Jun-20 02:54 PM] Polk#1596

[18-Jun-20 02:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
a leaking incident was reported to me a few days ago


[18-Jun-20 02:56 PM] Polk#1596

[18-Jun-20 03:00 PM] bman#0435
bri is saying that most of her chats from her warning were in whispers


[18-Jun-20 03:00 PM] bman#0435
and whispers dont always show up as /w in chatlogs now


[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
maybe let her appeal the warning

[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435
do i need to take a vote to have her appeal it


[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435
or take then vote when we get the appeal


[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmm


[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
just appeal it, i approve


[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435
kk


[18-Jun-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
its false anyway if it was in /w


[18-Jun-20 03:02 PM] bman#0435
all she needs is 3 sentences+ right


[18-Jun-20 03:02 PM] bman#0435
ive yet to do a warning appeal lol


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
wait actually


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
if its false, she shouldn't have to appeal it


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
so u can just revoke it


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
basically u appeal it for her


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435
wut


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
just like revoke the warning


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
the appealing would be if the warning was genuine


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435
o i cant since katie did the warning


[18-Jun-20 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
okay just tell her the warning will be revoked


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
and ask katie to delete itonce she's online!


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435

Too many MRs have been trying to use the fly command, if it continues to happen I may make an announcement to all MRs reminding them now to use the fly command.


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
so am i telling bri that basically since it was mostly in whispers the warning will be revoked but just be more aware of what ur doing in the tc


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
yea bear mentioned he might disable the fly command for mrs


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
@stacey polk made an announcement not too long ago :D


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
Ohh good


[18-Jun-20 03:04 PM] xM_inn#2821

@bman yessir


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] anna#0004
guys do u think it should be made aware that when banning ppl on discord they should add the date so that when people appeal we know if its been 30 days or not


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
yes


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
ive been doing that


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
but we can also


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes that'd help


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
like


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
check their tag


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
saves us scrolling through audits


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
and dyno logs bans


[18-Jun-20 03:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
for hours on end


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
but ye i think we should add dates too


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] anna#0004
yeah earlier i asked someone to check their dyno history but they couldnt find it


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
anna ask in hr announcements and ping


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
so hrs can vote


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] anna#0004
okay


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
but i agree yes!


[18-Jun-20 03:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
and so does bman


[18-Jun-20 03:07 PM] Polk#1596
i do agree with that as well


[18-Jun-20 03:07 PM] Polk#1596
i proposed that idea ages ago


[18-Jun-20 03:07 PM] Polk#1596
but i was just told to search up in logs


[18-Jun-20 03:07 PM] Polk#1596
actually ram notes the date! good boy ramm


[18-Jun-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
@katie hi when u wake up can u delete bris warning if u can? min allowed it to be revoked as she claimed most of the chatlogs were in whispers, and i can back her up since whispers dont always appear in chatlogs with the /w before it.


[18-Jun-20 03:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
it's a shame discord doesn't already have that feature, like when u click on a person's ban u can see the time & date the ban was issued


[18-Jun-20 03:08 PM] anna#0004

@anna I don‚Äôt like the idea of Daisies appealing. She‚Äôs done WAY too many things in the past to prove she should basically never appeal. She‚Äôs one of the people I would never appeal tbh


[18-Jun-20 03:10 PM] Cam#5887

There is just some former MRs that have done way too many things. Jacob and Daisies being one of them.

and i have to say that i agree


[18-Jun-20 10:51 PM] bman#0435
i thought we got rid of fancy greetings lol


[18-Jun-20 10:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
i want to see
"Hello! Welcome to Bloxton. How can I help you?"


[18-Jun-20 10:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
not the copy and paste bots

[18-Jun-20 10:52 PM] bman#0435
warn (verbal or written) them to change it


[18-Jun-20 10:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
its programmed in everyone's mind to do it already


[18-Jun-20 10:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
dont know how its possible to change it 1 staff at a time


[18-Jun-20 10:52 PM] bman#0435
have mrs remind them when they see it'


[18-Jun-20 10:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
that could work


[18-Jun-20 10:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
i think someone should make an announcement about it


[18-Jun-20 10:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
i never liked the over-fancy greeting


[18-Jun-20 10:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
it has got to go


[18-Jun-20 10:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
professional doesn't mean essay-typed


[18-Jun-20 10:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
100% customers/hotel guests DO NOT read the entire greeting.


[18-Jun-20 10:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
so its a waste


[18-Jun-20 10:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
and it just fills the chat


[18-Jun-20 10:54 PM] bman#0435
i can announce shortly


[18-Jun-20 10:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
sure


[18-Jun-20 10:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
provide an example of a simple greeting so they know


[18-Jun-20 10:55 PM] bman#0435
ye


[18-Jun-20 10:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
also i dont want emojis in the greetings.


[18-Jun-20 10:55 PM] Beartikal#9760

if any senior or hr wants to host with u then theyre ur cohost


[19-Jun-20 04:00 PM] bman#0435
so like 1 person can do like intro and rank passers

and thats NOT a good thing


[19-Jun-20 07:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
it sounds like a robot omg


[19-Jun-20 07:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
huh


[19-Jun-20 07:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
the greeting should simply be


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"Hello! How may I help you?"


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
"Hello! Welcome to Bloxton! What can I get you?"


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats it


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
not whatever i just read


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I used that one..."Hello! How may I help you?"


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
at reception i used: "Hi."


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
and that works.


[19-Jun-20 07:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Customer yelled and was like "TOO SHORT"


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
screw that customer


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im like sir ur the only one who has had a problem with it


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Then other staff was gonna start trynna tell me how to do one and telling me to put emojis


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im not putting that mess in my intro


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
thank god you agree


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
nobody wants a mess in their intro


[19-Jun-20 07:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
at least i dont


[19-Jun-20 07:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They said it was "more professional"


[19-Jun-20 07:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
no its just a hot mess


[19-Jun-20 07:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think I told this in the other Server.


[19-Jun-20 07:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But it was that mythical guy trying to get my to say C7RN


[19-Jun-20 08:04 PM] bman#0435
o rigjt i needa announce it


[19-Jun-20 08:25 PM] bman#0435
bruh what happened to that greeting announcement i thought emma made


[19-Jun-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
nobody cared i guess


[19-Jun-20 08:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you start drilling it into their minds that it will reduce chance for promotions you'll see how quickly their greetings will change


[19-Jun-20 08:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
(Even if its a bluff, it will work)


[19-Jun-20 08:47 PM] bman#0435
no like i generally remember emma making an announcemrnt about it


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] bman#0435
to the public


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] bman#0435
and i cant find it


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] katie#0200
o


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] bman#0435
and then someome said we were dumbing down the english dictionary


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] bman#0435
so she made snother announcement on how we werent doing that


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] bman#0435
what happened to it


[19-Jun-20 08:48 PM] katie#0200
maybe when she was banned her messages for the past 7 days were removed


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
oh


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
well we've announced some things many times and people still do it so


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
like hinting reports for example


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] katie#0200
I think that happened here too


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
new people join the server and then people forget


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
so announcements dont work all the time


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
no because she talked in announcements 6/2


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
wait mvm that was


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
more than a week before


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] katie#0200
hm


[19-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
did she make the announcement 1 week before?


[19-Jun-20 08:51 PM] katie#0200
i thought she made it on the 4th of June if im not wrong


[19-Jun-20 08:51 PM] katie#0200
Which is 7 days before she was banned


[19-Jun-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
i cant exactly make an announcement to mrs regarding the announcement if its gone...


[19-Jun-20 08:52 PM] Beartikal#9760
shouldn't be deleted


[19-Jun-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
hm


[19-Jun-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
@Beartikal when u guys banned her what timeframe did u set the messages to be deleted from


[19-Jun-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
like 24 hour, 3 days, 7 days, or nothing


[19-Jun-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
i think


[19-Jun-20 08:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
ya i dont remember


[19-Jun-20 10:55 PM] KjRBLX#2053

skin tone with no clothing = ask to put it on (if refuse then ban)


[20-Jun-20 12:50 AM] bman#0435

Like a perm ban or server ban?


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] courtney#5125
good point, but theyre trustworthy


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs a perm ban then no


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
@courtney ya not all....


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] katie#0200
yeah i'd say just server ban


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] courtney#5125
they know how to ban in general, they know commands


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
Seniors can already ban during banning sessions


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
server ban


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
i agree with


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] impact#0297
1) server ban for senior managers in hotel sessions


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] courtney#5125
well yeah bman not all, but


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
server ban would prevent trollers because from what ive seen they only go to one server to annoy one person


[20-Jun-20 11:14 AM] bman#0435
LOL candy


[20-Jun-20 11:15 AM] courtney#5125

[20-Jun-20 11:19 AM] katie#0200
why did artyphos get management i dont see what he could do differently to any other manager


[20-Jun-20 11:19 AM] bman#0435
ok so like what was the point in promoting the 2 free ranked people if its temporary?


[20-Jun-20 11:19 AM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 11:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
there was only a few which actually passed the initial app


[20-Jun-20 11:23 AM] bman#0435
we do


[20-Jun-20 11:23 AM] bman#0435
we have ticket sessions


[20-Jun-20 11:23 AM] courtney#5125
we do but not on a reg basis


[20-Jun-20 11:23 AM] bman#0435
^


[20-Jun-20 11:23 AM] ethan;#0003
they should be able to do it without an HR's permission


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] ethan;#0003
and without HR's supervision


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
We allow them to do it with supervision from an HR because only HRs can actually give them the talkative roles


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] courtney#5125
they'd have access to them at all times?


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
We have to give them the support team role to see the tickets


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] courtney#5125
no unless an HR gives them the support team role during a ticket session


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] bman#0435
hrs give them a role to see/review the tickets when they host a tickeet session


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] ethan;#0003
we just recently started to do ticket sessions when they started to overflow everday


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
Its also an issue that only HRs can give them the actually talkative role itself


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
ticket sessions seem to work


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] courtney#5125
i like it right now


[20-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
It doesnt take too long either


[20-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
we have training guides tho


[20-Jun-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
We have one in the discord already


[20-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
oHHHHH


[20-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
he means one that like everyone has to use


[20-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
but not every employee has discord/access to those guides


[20-Jun-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
ohh


[20-Jun-20 11:28 AM] courtney#5125
yeah i mean, not to bring in other groups or anything, but groups like boba does that and it looks really nice


[20-Jun-20 11:28 AM] ethan;#0003
maybe if we can get baby to update that dev fourms post with the guides that is linked on the group wall


[20-Jun-20 11:28 AM] anna#0004
oh, yeah I don't mind making one


[20-Jun-20 11:28 AM] courtney#5125
ill start working on one later today, if thats ok! ill dm anna too with it


[20-Jun-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
What about official helper guides too?


[20-Jun-20 11:28 AM] courtney#5125

[20-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 11:30 AM] anna#0004
lmao yeah


[20-Jun-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
Thats just too personal and people can get doxxed that way


[20-Jun-20 11:30 AM] courtney#5125
plus sometimes ppl might accidentally click it and -


[20-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bman#0435
flyro did it today and an mr recorded it but i mean its not rly doxxing since he broadcasted his face to the vc call

[20-Jun-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
I mean going forward when general discussion gets too bad we can put slowmode on

The 3 warning system


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] ethan;#0003
i think seniors should be allowed to read tickets without an HR's permission


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] bman#0435
how we allow blacklisted users to appeal


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] katie#0200
i dont like dealing with appeals i think we could organise that better


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] bman#0435
how after someones appeal gets denied they make another appeal directly after


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] courtney#5125
i don't like how applications and blacklists are on the same board, but i think I saw bear say something about how they were changing it so we didn't have to use trello at all. not sure tho :/


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] anna#0004
i know the application board is quite a problem with all of the permanently denied


[20-Jun-20 11:35 AM] anna#0004
yeah what candy said


[20-Jun-20 11:36 AM] ethan;#0003
it causes a ton of lag

management board, I feel like there‚Äôs so many lists that we don‚Äôt need cause we have the discord plus it‚Äôs laggy


[20-Jun-20 11:36 AM] courtney#5125
yeah it takes like 5 seconds to click on stuff


[20-Jun-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
there is over 1k cards of blacklisted people


[20-Jun-20 11:36 AM] bman#0435
i dont like how people can make more applications if their card was placed in the "passed" list


[20-Jun-20 11:36 AM] bman#0435
and how theres no pass/fail status on peoples applications


[20-Jun-20 11:36 AM] bman#0435
i dont like how we r limited to what we can and cant say overall in both discords


[20-Jun-20 11:37 AM] impact#0297
@babymariobebe @Beartikal -- immediately move the permanently denied on the application trello board to another trello board.. causing lag with the applications


[20-Jun-20 11:37 AM] bman#0435
pretty sure they threatened us if we discussed about emma and trey...


[20-Jun-20 11:37 AM] courtney#5125
personally, i feel like there should be a type of "cooldown" for ban appeals. i tell people their appeal has been denied and a brief reason as to why, and they IMMEDIATELY send the same appeal but with added touches from what i said


[20-Jun-20 11:37 AM] ethan;#0003
the ban appeal system is too messy


[20-Jun-20 11:37 AM] ethan;#0003
most of the time the appeals dont get to the hrs


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] katie#0200
yeah


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
I dont like how ban appeals are on the discord


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
A trello board could work


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] anna#0004
i also feel like ban appeals should be more of a priority since there are always so many and not too many people do them


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] anna#0004
yeha a trello board would be good


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] katie#0200
yeah i was thinking of a trello board


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] bman#0435
omg not another trello board üò≠


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] ethan;#0003
I know some games have a seperate discord server for ban appeals


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] courtney#5125
thats what i was thinking LOL @bman


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] bman#0435
we already have like 10


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] bman#0435
getting 1 more


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] bman#0435
:C


[20-Jun-20 11:38 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^^^


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] courtney#5125
anything but lag


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
Id rather have more trello boards


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] anna#0004
^


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] katie#0200
same


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] ethan;#0003
another board


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no I guess not


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] bman#0435
no


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] ethan;#0003
and it cant be in a discord channel, too many chanels exist already


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] ethan;#0003
for so many things


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] ethan;#0003
and its hard to keep track of


[20-Jun-20 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
People also complain how they have to find a manager+ to send in an appeal


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] anna#0004
Or they send it to more than one manager and both get sent in


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] impact#0297
hub -> sorts to appropriate trello board based on submission


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] ethan;#0003
can we remove the useless channels in the discord


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] anna#0004
seems good


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] courtney#5125
sounds like a plan


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
yes


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] ethan;#0003
like timezone squad channels


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] katie#0200
yes


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] bman#0435
24/7


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] bman#0435
seniors voted on it


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
applications are open all the time now


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] katie#0200
apps are open 24/7 now


[20-Jun-20 11:40 AM] katie#0200
yeah lol


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] anna#0004
yeah


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] courtney#5125
we really brought this upon ourselves didnt we-


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] courtney#5125
.


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] anna#0004
thats why it's an issue with all the permanently denied there too


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] anna#0004
thats fine


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] courtney#5125
yeah its been going kinda nonstop for a bit im pretty sure


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] bman#0435
LMFAO ANNA AND CANDY


[20-Jun-20 11:41 AM] bman#0435
LOL


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
it takes me like 5 minutes to open up hr board, imagine what its like for app board üòî


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] courtney#5125
no its not i did applications as a senior and it was really smooth


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] anna#0004
it isnt laggy on my phone


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
the mobile trello app sucks


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
its so glitchy


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
mine crashes all the time


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] bman#0435
cb server?


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] katie#0200
oml


[20-Jun-20 11:42 AM] stacey#1000
the discord server?


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] anna#0004
ive never been involved with one so not too sure


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
so people who r cbs (make alts to get around their bans) made a discord serevr to basically plan raids and get along with each other to "take over bloxton and destroy it"


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] courtney#5125
yeah arent some mrs in the "cb servers"


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] courtney#5125
so thats not a good


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
^^


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] courtney#5125
"image" to put out if mrs are interacting with the people who are literally perm denied and banned from our games


[20-Jun-20 11:43 AM] bman#0435
glad to know a few managers socialize with the cbs that got other managers fired for leaking üôÉ


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] katie#0200
theyre friends with the people who raid


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] katie#0200
they dont raid themselves


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] anna#0004
theyve been reminded before not to involve themselves with cbs


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
well no so like cbs try to get mr positions too, and its the mrs friends (the cbs) trying to raid


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] courtney#5125
didnt one manager publicly state they were literally "friends with a cb"?


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] courtney#5125
we cant have that


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Wasn‚Äôt it UNI


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
we already caught one LMFAO stacey was SO CLOSE to promoting but then a senior realized they might be a CB


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
uni*


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] stacey#1000
Uni is


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] courtney#5125
yeah i think bloo


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
uni and vac


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] katie#0200
im sure a lot are friends with cbs


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] ethan;#0003
we cant control who people are friends with we cant fire people based on who they are friends with


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] anna#0004
a few mrs send their dms with cbs in staff lounge


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] anna#0004
and they seem to be friends with them


[20-Jun-20 11:44 AM] courtney#5125
right ethan but if theyre being involved with cb servers and constantly associating with them


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
we cant control who theyre friends with but they can be deemed as threats to bloxton


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] katie#0200
some mrs are like "aww i miss this cb she wasnt that annoying at the hotel"


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] courtney#5125
yeah what bman saidd


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
like i dont miss any cb when i got promoted to shift like 3/4 quit üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] anna#0004
yes, there's an MR who's friends with meme and meme threatens to dox people which isn't good


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
^


[20-Jun-20 11:45 AM] bman#0435
fun üòç


[20-Jun-20 11:46 AM] stacey#1000
Meme and Ava are the worst cbs out there


[20-Jun-20 11:46 AM] anna#0004
they are


[20-Jun-20 11:46 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Omg right


[20-Jun-20 11:46 AM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 11:46 AM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] bman#0435
next callerrrrrrrrrr


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
Thats easier for CBs to get a job


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] katie#0200
that would make it so easy for cbs to get jobs


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
and troll


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] anna#0004
^^


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] katie#0200
^^


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] courtney#5125
no i wouldnt like that


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] courtney#5125
right


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] bman#0435
it doesnt show us what people r capable of so nty


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] stacey#1000
I thought we were getting new interview/application questions


[20-Jun-20 11:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Stacey didn‚Äôt u make some


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
Yes and Bear approved it


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435
all theyre doing is picking a sequence of buttons


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
but idk if he forgot or not


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] anna#0004
Ya they're good


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
We have 5 new easier questions


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435
bear doesnt want interviews to be difficult tho


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
that bear agreed on like a month ago


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] courtney#5125
yeah it doesnt let ppl show what theyre really about. i feel like the apps we have now are kinda what puts us apart? it feels more real and more like actual job questions, people are able to personalize kinda and show their strengths


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435
considering we argued over a grammar rule to let people staylonger


[20-Jun-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
QI) How did you discover Bloxton Hotels?

QII) Why are you interested in working at Bloxton Hotels? (Provide II+ detailed sentences) 

QIII) What are some goals you have planned for the group?
 
QIV) What skills do you have that will benefit you working here? (Provide II+ detailed sentences.)

 QV) What III words best describe you and your personality?
is that good?


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] courtney#5125
i love those questions yeah


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
Thats the 5 questions the HRs agreed on and Bear agreed on


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Having that kinda application process for a 1 million group, idk doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs fitting. I personally feel that‚Äôs for a group that has like under what, 20k members or so


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
for stewed literally to pass applications all u havee to do is press the buttons with a period üíÄ


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] anna#0004
Alright


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] katie#0200
ok


[20-Jun-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435
@anna whatd he say he cut out for me


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
@impact Can I use the 5 questions I sent or do I need to come up with a new one again


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
ok


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] anna#0004
we need to have an interview question by next week @bman


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] bman#0435
ohhhh ok


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] katie#0200
can we make new MRs spectate the first interview they attend


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] katie#0200
because most of the time they dont rlly know what to do i dont think


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] courtney#5125
oooo katie i like that


[20-Jun-20 11:50 AM] anna#0004
alrighty


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] courtney#5125
i know that boba and pastriez have stuff like that for training, and it allows the new mrs to learn more and figure it out


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] bman#0435
LOL april fools training


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LMAO


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] bman#0435
listed as bonnies session


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] bman#0435
BAHAHHA


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] anna#0004
LOL


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] katie#0200
lol


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
Can we eliminate roleplay during trainings? It makes it longer


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
Like if its troll test and tivia


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] courtney#5125
it takes a lot longer to do roleplays, i agree


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I agree it does make it longer


[20-Jun-20 11:51 AM] bman#0435
no because even passers dont know how to handle trollers when they see one


[20-Jun-20 11:52 AM] ethan;#0003
we NEED to eliminate how at interviews and trainings when they pass they go over like 15 rules at the start and the end


[20-Jun-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
The main thing is the troll test and trivia questions


[20-Jun-20 11:52 AM] courtney#5125
and if they dont know how to use commands for reception, make snacks, or use the tools, then they didnt pay attention when the trainer was talking and they didnt pay attention during trivia


[20-Jun-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[20-Jun-20 11:52 AM] courtney#5125
yeah


[20-Jun-20 11:52 AM] bman#0435
O YA commands for reception need to be fixed. u can only use them in the waiting area and not in the actual reception area


[20-Jun-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
tc


[20-Jun-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
I mean security never did roleplay anyways during trainings


[20-Jun-20 11:53 AM] courtney#5125
i really dont think it changes how the trainees will be trained, no


[20-Jun-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
So I dont see why all the other ranks need to


[20-Jun-20 11:53 AM] anna#0004
Yeah because security doesn't do a roleplay so it wouldn't matter if the other's don't either, I'm sure thye know how to act to a normal guest


[20-Jun-20 11:53 AM] anna#0004

Hi my name is Bloo, I‚Äôve been here for 4 years, and what I‚Äôm working on, is trying to organize myself, feel like I tend to procrastinate on a lot of things. My weakness is that I say I‚Äôll do something, but in the end I don‚Äôt feel like doing it, for example doing sessions lol.

Hello, my name is Min, I've been here since December of 2017 meaning I'm almost approaching my 3 years within the company. My main goal for this week is working on organizing the event we're hosting next week with Koala Cafe to ensure it goes smoothly and the entire community has a blast. My weaknesses is sometimes forgetting about things I'm supposed to be doing and also having a bad sleeping schedule, though I am working on fixing that. My strengths are being open to change and dedicated to all of my groups.


[20-Jun-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Is that okay?


[20-Jun-20 12:04 PM] bman#0435
o wait theres no order anymore?


[20-Jun-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821

[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
OHHHH


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i was waiting for ord-


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] courtney#5125
OK


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] courtney#5125
Okay, my name is Candy. I've worked at Bloxton for what will be 2 years in the fall. My strengths include organizational skills, a good eye for detail, and I know how to handle conflict head on. Some of my weaknesses include having a hard time asking others for help, sometimes I can be too self-critical of what I do, and sometimes I might take things too personally. My goal/job for this week is to work on creating a draft training guide with Anna.


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] stacey#1000
Hi my name is Stacey, I‚Äôve been here for almost 3 years (August 2017) and this week I am working on getting onto a better schedule with better organization.  My strengths are investigations as I have learned a lot regarding it, and my weaknesses are not being the best at responding to people's DMs regarding their concerns.


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] bman#0435
hi im bman. ive been working here for like 2 years nearly 3. this week im doing whatever my parents force me to do so nothing in specifics üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è. my weaknesses are my parents, my wifi, and camp even tho i love camp but i cant be active here. my strength is arguing and complaining üòç


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Hi im Tatto, In August it‚Äôll be my 4th year working here. What I‚Äôm working on is to do more sessions and getting  more involved. My weakness is organization


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] ethan;#0003
Hi my name is Ethan, I have been here since October 2016. I enjoy hosting sessions and talking to MR's. My weakness is paying attention.


[20-Jun-20 12:05 PM] katie#0200
hi my name is katie, ive been working here for a little more than 2 and a half years and this week i'm trying to make my schedule more predictable because most of the time i cant be certain as to when i'm available. im not really sure what my strengths are but if i would pick something i'd say dealing with applications and my weaknesses are getting organised


[20-Jun-20 12:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[20-Jun-20 12:07 PM] courtney#5125

1) seniors allowed server ban at hotel session (but not perm ban)
2) create hub for all submissions, applications, appeals.. revamp & remove trello board lag -- remove permanently denied from applications
3) enforce any MR who is involved in 'raiding' but not necessarily friends with raiders
4) new interview/application questions -- consult with high ranks to build list next week
5) phase out roleplaying from trainings
6) candy & anna -- build a draft training guide, no emojis -- MR's spectate first interview session

@babymariobebe @Beartikal let's talk about this tomorrow

[20-Jun-20 12:17 PM] impact#0297
@High Rank i forgot to ask, i swear it was on my notes.. former MR chat?


[20-Jun-20 12:17 PM] Polk#1596
no


[20-Jun-20 12:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I don‚Äôt think we should add one


[20-Jun-20 12:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
no lol


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
personally, no. thats giving them a chat to trash us and stuff.


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] anna#0004
that isnt happening


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] Polk#1596
all of the HRs made a 100% agreement that we will never make a former MR chat


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
it'll just be used for all the wrong reasons.


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] impact#0297
you know what I would be interested in doing lowkey


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
i wouldnt mind a former hr chat but not a former mr chat


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] courtney#5125
we had a brief discussion on it a few days ago in this chat, and several hrs made very valid points for each side


[20-Jun-20 12:18 PM] impact#0297
allow former MR chat for 3 days and see how many rule violations we have


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] Cam#5887
there is about to be every damn rule broken üòÇ


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] courtney#5125
and there's honestly no harm in trying. at least if we try it out, we'd have a clear and exact reason as to why it didn't work


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435
NOOOOOO no former mr chat


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] impact#0297
anybody wanna let them have a former MR chat for the weekend? count the rule violations on monday?


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435
@impact also is there a reason baby and bear couldnt make it to the meeting


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] impact#0297
no clue


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] courtney#5125
yeah bman there are a lot of cons to it, but several of our former mrs/hrs resigned on good terms with no hard feelings towards the group


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I dont mind trying it but a lot of formers have proved they dont deserve it by either leaking or causing drama


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435
no because when we remove the chat theyll just beg for it back üôÑ


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] impact#0297
but I'm glad I had a good conversation with you guys


[20-Jun-20 12:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
i mean i guess we could try it out but its a bad idea


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] courtney#5125
a lot are "toxic" and just want trouble, but there are still former mrs/hrs that simply want to talk with some people who know more about the conversation in some cases


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
former HR chat sure


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
former MR


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
big no for me


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] impact#0297
kk


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] anna#0004
oh btw someone leaked images of staff lounge to exotic/lauren the other day


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah idk about former mr chat


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] courtney#5125
omg=


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
too many issues that I know will occur lol


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] impact#0297
i'm going to get a hold of baby & bear.. would you all be ok with announcing a Former HR chat and that we are assessing a former MR chat?


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[20-Jun-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
@anna who


[20-Jun-20 12:21 PM] courtney#5125

[20-Jun-20 12:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes former hr chat i wouldn‚Äôt mind


[20-Jun-20 12:21 PM] courtney#5125

[20-Jun-20 12:21 PM] anna#0004
well she showed me them right, but she was basically just trying to report uni to me and she quickly made it clear that she doesnt know who sent them bc it was an LR that sent them to her

[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
personally i think a former MR chat is a bad idea.. we could try it out but.. not a good idea


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah, I‚Äôm not as worried with trying out former hr chats - Uh LMAO well I mean if I really wanted to but don‚Äôt feel like it üíÄ


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
wait


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
i think we should do a former hr chat


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
former hr or mr


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
and if its working for the hrs, we can do some sort of former mr chat


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôm all for having former hr chat tbh, not as worried as I would be with if we did former mr lol


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] impact#0297
Former HR - yes, needs baby & bear approval
Former MR - no, but we COULD TRY it


[20-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
basically yes


[20-Jun-20 12:27 PM] courtney#5125
i dont see the harm in trying a former mr chat, personally. if they cant handle it then they clearly didnt want it that bad in the first place


[20-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So many toxic Mrs,


[20-Jun-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
i don‚Äôt CARE about trying it


[20-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
but


[20-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
idk


[20-Jun-20 12:28 PM] courtney#5125
and not all former mrs are toxic. there are several that resigned on good terms, no hard feelings, still like the group, and only want a place to talk with their former mr friends


[20-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Polk#1596
sure i like ur idea


[20-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Polk#1596
but im pretty sure the outcome will be bad


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] impact#0297
@bman come back to discussion chat on the BH server


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
idc abt trying it but i already know the outcome


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
k


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
the outcome is gonna be bad


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
no doubt about it


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
but we can try


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
i don‚Äôt mind


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] courtney#5125
the main reason we dont want it is bc most of the toxic ones messed it up for the ones that arent toxic


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
we can also make it clear in the announcement that they only have 1 shot


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] courtney#5125
trueee


[20-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but then that will start issues


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Cam#5887
i mean


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I do too


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] courtney#5125
definitely gonna need plenty of moderation for that time


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Cam#5887
they may listen then


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Cam#5887
if we say they have 1 shot


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Polk#1596
sure but then some former MRs might start leaking messages from the former MR chat to people that got removed


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[20-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I say we don‚Äôt just to see how it goes


[20-Jun-20 12:31 PM] courtney#5125
there are several that have a good history while on the mr team, and have continued to enjoy bloxton as a group. grouping them all into one bad bunch doesnt seem SUPER fair in my opinion


[20-Jun-20 12:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause they‚Äôre only gonna act there best for those 3 days


[20-Jun-20 12:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and then after probably start messing up


[20-Jun-20 12:31 PM] impact#0297
we got general discussion fired up, if any HR's wanna join this discussion on Former MR chat please please please join


[20-Jun-20 12:31 PM] bman#0435
theyre literally gonna BEG us for it to come back. they beg us to have the chat, i dont see y they would to get it back. they just want their way 24/7 now


[20-Jun-20 12:31 PM] Cam#5887
true


[20-Jun-20 12:32 PM] courtney#5125
yea that a problem


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
told yall they just wanna get their way


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
lo


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
l


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] courtney#5125
yeah after seeing that i dont think itll work. we'd need so much moderation to the point where no ones gonna enjoy it for what it is


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
they do


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
they legit do bman


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887

[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
not all formers are bad


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
some just don‚Äôt know how to act


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] courtney#5125
if they come to their senses im sure we can reconsider someday üòå


[20-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[20-Jun-20 12:50 PM] impact#0297
@High Rank scrap hinting reports ??? anyone disagree?


[20-Jun-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435
would hinting be put onto staff reports agian


[20-Jun-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435
because i mean generally the hinting reports r useful


[20-Jun-20 12:50 PM] courtney#5125
would they put it in a new list specifically for hinting or would it go back to warnings issued?


[20-Jun-20 12:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
disagree


[20-Jun-20 12:50 PM] courtney#5125
ah okay

[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Cam#5887
i like hinting reports


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Polk#1596
i think only bonnie does them because he made that to a thing


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] bman#0435
bonnies in his own hr channel but not in the meeting room :PensiveNeko:


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] stacey#1000
join the vc @bonnie591


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] courtney#5125
YEAH i was trying to do them like 2 nights ago and there are some from the very very very beginning of june


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Polk#1596
like as long as he deals with it i dont mind it existing


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Cam#5887
bonnie sucks üëé


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont but i think we should keep it there so we can search for any hinting reports on someone before the promotion


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
you know what im saying yes


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Cam#5887
i agree


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Polk#1596
good idea bon


[20-Jun-20 12:51 PM] Cam#5887
with bonnie


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] impact#0297
@bonnie591 would you rather just have hinting reports still open, but requires no action from HR's?


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] impact#0297
so people can submit hinting reports with proof


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] courtney#5125
yeah what if they dont need to be reviewed, but ppl put it there for us to reference?


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
that sounds good


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] Cam#5887
but what about promo blacklists


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] courtney#5125
and seniors to reference for their suggestions too


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] bman#0435
i think we should like still have hinting reports and a hinting list that limits people from a promotion for a certain time period, but ill do whatever it takes to not review hinting to help reports over hinting promotion reports


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
keep list for any major offenses from time to time @Cam


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] Cam#5887
okay


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
keep current blacklists


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] Cam#5887
but there will be no more temp?


[20-Jun-20 12:52 PM] Cam#5887
temporary promo blacklist?


[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] courtney#5125
we could keep the list for perm promo blacklists ?

[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] Cam#5887
we need to keep the list


[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] Cam#5887
because of the perm


[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] courtney#5125

[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] courtney#5125

but when we


[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] Cam#5887
have a temp


[20-Jun-20 12:53 PM] Cam#5887
it‚Äôs because they hint, can‚Äôt be promoted for 2 months


[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435

[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] Cam#5887
only perms


[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] Cam#5887
so would we base a promotion off of how many months it‚Äôs been from a hunting report?


[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] Cam#5887
hinting


[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] Cam#5887
**


[20-Jun-20 12:54 PM] courtney#5125

[20-Jun-20 12:55 PM] courtney#5125

1) seniors allowed server ban at hotel session (but not perm ban)
2) create hub for all submissions, applications, appeals.. revamp & remove trello board lag -- remove permanently denied from applications
3) enforce any MR who is involved in 'raiding' but not necessarily friends with raiders
4) new interview/application questions -- consult with high ranks to build list next week
5) phase out roleplaying from trainings
6) candy & anna -- build a draft training guide, no emojis -- MR's spectate first interview session


[20-Jun-20 12:57 PM] bonnie591#0591

Another question for my sticky notes: In what situations do we use :ban (not pban)


[20-Jun-20 02:54 PM] Polk#1596
you only really use :ban if like


[20-Jun-20 02:55 PM] Polk#1596
u fired someone, and so u ban them from that server so they cant join back and abuse

If this user claims they were confused about the question in the FAQ channel, is their suspension false/able to be revoked? https://trello.com/c/kYFKA1C7/34306-vylkyrie-7-lack-of-grammar-being-off-task

i think if we were truly trying to show others the people in specified ranks, the first would be good. if we were trying to show people who is or isnt staff, the 2nd one

[21-Jun-20 12:09 AM] bman#0435
^


[21-Jun-20 12:09 AM] ethan;#0003
since the text is black


[21-Jun-20 12:09 AM] ethan;#0003
black on dark blue would be hard to read


[21-Jun-20 12:10 AM] ethan;#0003
or it might be white text


[21-Jun-20 12:10 AM] ethan;#0003

[21-Jun-20 12:10 AM] bman#0435

when the nametags are white it gets a little confusing


[21-Jun-20 04:53 AM] Polk#1596
is it possible if u can let the nametags have the usual colors back, or at least the LR, MR, or HR color?

I got baby to look


[21-Jun-20 03:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
He looking


[21-Jun-20 03:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Let me know if i should cancel


[21-Jun-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
we all did


[21-Jun-20 03:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'd recommend u do but up to u unless baby says halt


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
im not trying to put people at risk because we decided to ignore people getting their location doxxed


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
guys


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
is there any proof of this


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
polk said he experienced it at interviews


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
so


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
also even if they were to somehow get the ip address of a player (doubtful), they couldn't do anything with this


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
they're just using big words like address to scare you


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
an ip address is basically just an internet address is holds no data


[21-Jun-20 03:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
it


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I don‚Äôt want everyone knowing my personal address so


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
theyre saying peoples locations...


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
lol


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
cities r a little too close for comfort on my end


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
not sure abt u


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
baby i saw it in-game


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
i saw them say


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I ain‚Äôt hosting anything until this thing blows over because I‚Äôd like to not have my personal info exposed


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
like


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
(not about me of course) but they went


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
Polkinolk 845.5459.584


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
and stuff like that


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Think imma cancel even tho i already said i live in Mississippi


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] Polk#1596
i thought it was a joke but now its been confirmed i guess


[21-Jun-20 03:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Gotta keep other people safe


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
pretty sure its been happening at the hotel in the past


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
i remember people calling for me because ip doxxers were there


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
If this was an actual problem surely Roblox would've acted on it by now and immediately found a fix or something. Idk, I feel like it could be rumours. (Not saying it is rumours, it could be true, but I'm just looking at the other side of things.)


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if a lot of other roblox groups are closing like Boba then this is really serious


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
guys


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Minn it's roblox


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
we cant expect roblox to fix every issue immediately tho


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
lol


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
They can take ages


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sometimes


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
and its not rumors


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah but surely an issue like this would be prioritized


[21-Jun-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
polk just said he expereinced it


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
the best thing they can do is give an approximate locatioon if they were somehow to actually get your public ip


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435
either way, i dont want people knowing the city/town i live in lmfao


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] Polk#1596
i would still halt sessions until at least wednesday just to be safe


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I highly doubt they can get your ip


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
from playing a game


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] Polk#1596
boba is doing this as well


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435
but they did


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
it feels like a bit of an exaggeration


[21-Jun-20 03:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
nothing like this has happened before


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] stacey#1000
I already cancelled all sessions I put and I ain‚Äôt hosting for a bit because of it so


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
yes it has-


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
when?


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
its happened at the hotel not too long ago


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I highly doubt it too but if people are closing then they must of checked if they  had the exact ip the hacker said


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] Polk#1596
either way, i think we should inform them about it @babymariobebe


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] Polk#1596
some people might not even know that their ip is at risk of being leaked


[21-Jun-20 03:11 PM] Polk#1596
like we should at least warn them


[21-Jun-20 03:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
My ip links to a mile away from me soo


[21-Jun-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
ya, can we use our platform of a 1 million member group to address the safety of the members of the group? some people might not even want people knowing what state they live in so imagine what they feel like if their city gets doxxed


[21-Jun-20 03:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
no wait


[21-Jun-20 03:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's probabaly a scare but I'll standby for now


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Once I finish this Stapleton shift -giggles-


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] bman#0435
i dont think like 5 other popular groups would close their games because it was a "scare"


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] bman#0435
but ok


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
do not announce anything until I get confirmation


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I'll ask around


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I have contacts of ppl from roblox


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] Polk#1596
alright, i have my announcement ready at least


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Okk


[21-Jun-20 03:13 PM] Polk#1596
so ping me whether or not it is true


[21-Jun-20 03:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk some kid got his dad a new hack kit?


[21-Jun-20 03:16 PM] stacey#1000
I mean even if it is or isn‚Äôt I don‚Äôt think it hurts to announce it


[21-Jun-20 03:16 PM] bman#0435
i dont think it hurts to close the games/cancel sessions either


[21-Jun-20 03:17 PM] bman#0435
but whatever


[21-Jun-20 03:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
For now I think we should recommend that people stay off games but their choice. Then if we get legit proof we fully cancel?


[21-Jun-20 03:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
No one gonna host anyway but


[21-Jun-20 03:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ye


[21-Jun-20 03:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ill put in my desc To Be Decided


[21-Jun-20 03:18 PM] Beartikal#9760
what communities have posted the announcement


[21-Jun-20 03:18 PM] bman#0435
in the screenshots it seems like


[21-Jun-20 03:18 PM] bman#0435
boba


[21-Jun-20 03:18 PM] bman#0435
panda


[21-Jun-20 03:18 PM] bman#0435
fizze


[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
no


[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
we arent cancelling.


[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
continue as normal, it's fake.

[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Polk#1596
wait what


[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] bman#0435

[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
where is proof that they can leak your IP

[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
its NOT real


[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
its literally fake


[21-Jun-20 03:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
and you guys are getting scared for it


[21-Jun-20 03:20 PM] impact#0297
@Beartikal yo can you make it so that strategic advisors can access the voice channels on this server


[21-Jun-20 03:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
sure.


[21-Jun-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
ok thank god


[21-Jun-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
well we had no way of confirming or denying it, so we just wanted to keep bloxton safe no matter what


[21-Jun-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
but all good now


[21-Jun-20 03:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
keep in mind, in-game exploiters CAN find your Country Code, such as:
US - United States
MX - Mexico
NL - Netherlands
ETC.

This is where the origin started, but this does NOT mean they have your IP.


[21-Jun-20 03:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
They can also find your platform such as 
Windows 10
Mac


[21-Jun-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
that is all.


[21-Jun-20 03:22 PM] Cam#5887
i stg if i go on damn roblox and i see my city and state i‚Äôm out üòÇ


[21-Jun-20 03:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
nope, just your country


[21-Jun-20 03:22 PM] impact#0297
yo they still locked bear

[21-Jun-20 03:23 PM] impact#0297
thanks


[21-Jun-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
i still see people thinking it is real in general discussion, so do u want me to make an announcement saying theres no need to be scared, its fake, etc ? @Beartikal


[21-Jun-20 03:24 PM] impact#0297
no because the announcement does the exact opposite of making people not scared


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
how


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
agreedd


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
ignore it.


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
what are we going to do about the people scared then


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
ok


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
if it brings up just say in discussion its fake


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
access to dyno logs pls!


[21-Jun-20 03:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Just how fast that blew up and just died is incredible


[21-Jun-20 03:26 PM] impact#0297
>make announcement
>tell people not to be scared about IP leaking
>people concerned, look further into it, realize tweets have been deleted, panic
>general discussion turns into a moshpit


[21-Jun-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
not one developer was talking about it, only gullible people actually posted an announcement about it, which just goes to show just how non-developers a lot of these groups are lol


[21-Jun-20 03:26 PM] impact#0297
other servers are deleting their announcements right now in an effort to cool down the discussion


[21-Jun-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
good, let's at least keep our community out of that mess


[21-Jun-20 03:27 PM] impact#0297
fizze only did it to pump their activity on a sunday afternoon

dodged a bullet there


[21-Jun-20 03:28 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal MRs are telling me it‚Äôs hard to find out who spams and stuff at the hotel because the chat box is all white and the usernames don‚Äôt have different colors when they chat now


[21-Jun-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
probs me breaking stuff ill fix it


[21-Jun-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760

bruh u told her why


[21-Jun-20 03:34 PM] impact#0297
you know what I realized


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] impact#0297
you could just pull player latency statistics from people in roblox and approximate their location


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] impact#0297
if that's what they are talking about


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats completely unreliable


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] impact#0297
you could narrow it down to like


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] impact#0297
300km


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] impact#0297
radius


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
no you could just have a trashy wifi


[21-Jun-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
and then you think im from china


[21-Jun-20 03:36 PM] impact#0297
your shitty wifi is represented in latency


[21-Jun-20 03:36 PM] impact#0297
not ping


[21-Jun-20 03:36 PM] impact#0297
30ms ping (router to server)


[21-Jun-20 03:36 PM] impact#0297
30ms latency (router to computer)


[21-Jun-20 03:36 PM] impact#0297
60ms


[21-Jun-20 03:37 PM] impact#0297
idk I'm just trying to figure out how this rumor came up


[21-Jun-20 03:37 PM] impact#0297
so dumb but I could see a 9 year old thinking he found something crazy in roblox studio


[21-Jun-20 03:37 PM] katie#0200
bruh why can‚Äôt she dm me @bman


[21-Jun-20 03:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563
the rumor comes up from exploiters printing fake ips


[21-Jun-20 03:37 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[21-Jun-20 04:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
im in the cb server there's nothing to investigate


[21-Jun-20 04:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
he never said he online dated he said he supported trump and they accused him of online dating


[21-Jun-20 04:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
the person that came to you with evidence is a new CB named katrina, just trying to get that MR fired


[21-Jun-20 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
that MR has already left the server


[21-Jun-20 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
so you should ignore what those CBs are telling you because it's not truthful information


[21-Jun-20 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
they just want mrs fired


[21-Jun-20 04:45 PM] xM_inn#2821

[21-Jun-20 05:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
theres no need to


[21-Jun-20 05:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
why would u take evidence form katrina, a CB


[21-Jun-20 05:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
we never take evidence from CBs


[21-Jun-20 05:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
so theres no need


[21-Jun-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
We‚Äôve taken evidence from a cb before of an MR leaking. Harriet. Yes CBs shouldn‚Äôt be trusted but you still never know.


[21-Jun-20 05:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
they just want him fired for no reason

[23-Jun-20 04:16 PM] babymariobebe#7563
the reason this 1 is bigger is because the width of each branch decreases by a smaller percentage, the loop stops when the branch is so small


[23-Jun-20 04:16 PM] babymariobebe#7563
so basically it allows for more branching because it doesnt get as smalll as fast


[23-Jun-20 04:16 PM] babymariobebe#7563
as the smaller one above


[23-Jun-20 04:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828

that looks like it took forever to build


[23-Jun-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I just need to add foilage on top and then make the branches wooden


[23-Jun-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
ITS GENERATED NOT BUILT LOL


[23-Jun-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
it took like 5 seconds to build yes


[23-Jun-20 04:17 PM] stacey#1000
LOL


[23-Jun-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[23-Jun-20 04:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[23-Jun-20 04:18 PM] stacey#1000

[23-Jun-20 06:57 PM] bman#0435

[23-Jun-20 06:57 PM] bman#0435
.


[23-Jun-20 06:57 PM] bman#0435
ya i did that LOL


[23-Jun-20 08:26 PM] courtney#5125
was it clarified that retard/retarded IS bypassing?


[23-Jun-20 08:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its "retard" or "retarded" then no but if its
"retardexed" "retardex" or some way that is not the original spelling then it is considered bypasssing


[23-Jun-20 08:28 PM] courtney#5125
ok gotchya. an mr mightve bypassed in a pm with someone but im trying to get the person whos reporting it to send me the screenshot she has


[23-Jun-20 08:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[23-Jun-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
wait that makes no sense


[23-Jun-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
if its not tagged then its not a bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
so i dont see y spelling it differently if it doesnt tag would consider it a bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
@courtney can u send the pm here


[23-Jun-20 08:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its not tagged as "retard" or "retarded" then its not a bypass
by spelling it as "retardedx" or "retardexed" then it IS a bypass.


[23-Jun-20 08:29 PM] courtney#5125
yup! just got it @bman

[23-Jun-20 08:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats a bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:30 PM] bman#0435
but its not a bypass if its not originally tagged?


[23-Jun-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Who did Armani send that to


[23-Jun-20 08:30 PM] courtney#5125
alistelle


[23-Jun-20 08:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
a bypass is something to get around tags... @bman ..?


[23-Jun-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
was it in a private server, candy?


[23-Jun-20 08:30 PM] bman#0435
exactly. if the original word doesnt tag then how would saying it differently make it a bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] courtney#5125
no, it was in a training server @xM_inn


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
what im saying is that if the original word "retarded" and "retard" DO tag and they spelled it differently then its a bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] courtney#5125
WIAT i mean no*


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
im assuming that "retard" and "retarded" are tagged


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
in this context


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
so therefore they used that


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
to bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] courtney#5125
she says it wasnt today, but it was recently


[23-Jun-20 08:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmm


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] bman#0435
ok


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
if "retard" and "retarded" are NOT tagged then this is not a bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
so ya


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] bman#0435
ye thats wut i was trying to say


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] bman#0435
cuz wut u said made me confused


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
go-in-game and find out


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
say it lol


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] bman#0435
im hosting rn


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
ohok


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
but basically to find out if it tags just say it


[23-Jun-20 08:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
then the question is answered


[23-Jun-20 08:33 PM] courtney#5125
ill go say it in a private server and see if it tags


[23-Jun-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
ook


[23-Jun-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
under a rare case it doesnt filter in chat then it does filter in chatlogs


[23-Jun-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
chatlogs is a stronger filter


[23-Jun-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
id base it on the chat box though


[23-Jun-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
not chatlogs


[23-Jun-20 08:36 PM] courtney#5125

[23-Jun-20 08:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
whats his big bad punishment


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] courtney#5125
hannvhh was suspended for bypassing once an interview session had concluded, so im assuming itd be the same for armani


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
well i mean he bypassed so üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
nah hannahs situation is different


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
because hers was after interviews


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] bman#0435
armani was during trainings


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] courtney#5125
well yes, but this was also in pms


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah should be the same


[23-Jun-20 08:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
during or after doesnt matter as its both in private chat


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
it would be worse if he said it out loud


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] courtney#5125

[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
when was it reported to u


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] courtney#5125
a while ago but she said she was scared to report it.


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] courtney#5125
she just reported it to me today, like 10 minutes ago


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
at this point its a little late to even do anything about it


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats what i would think


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] bman#0435
no not rly


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] bman#0435
lol


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
like thats over 2 weeks ago


[23-Jun-20 08:43 PM] bman#0435
we can still do something abt it


[23-Jun-20 08:44 PM] bman#0435
if it was like 2 months ago then not rly


[23-Jun-20 08:44 PM] bman#0435
but its still fairly recent


[23-Jun-20 08:44 PM] courtney#5125
she seems like she wouldve reported it earlier, but she said she was scared to report it ig?

[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
i think at this point we issue a warning for the bypass


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
bruh what


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
warning for bypassing...?


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Uh no


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
since when do we ever warn for bypassing lol


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
No they auto pban


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] courtney#5125
hannah was suspended for doing it after interviews. armani should have the same punishment


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] bman#0435
we suspended/fired others for the same actions


[23-Jun-20 08:49 PM] courtney#5125
both scenarios are at least a bit similar


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435
dont know y we would give a smaller punishment just because a manager was scared of reporting it


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
@courtney but that was reported right after it happened


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
this happened 13 days ago


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435
he still bypassed


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435
13 days ago is fairly recent


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] courtney#5125
right, he still did it


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
i think its too long ago to suspend him for it


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435
no not rly


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] courtney#5125
i mean marissa wasnt sure it was bypassing ig. yeah she definitely couldve asked sooner, but it doesnt change the fact that armani still bypassed at training


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435
lol


[23-Jun-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435

The triple number 888 is one that's seen as positive and progressive. If you've been seeing this number a lot lately, prepare for a world of abundance and opportunities coming your way in a short while. The number 888 is all about positive changes.

u said u no like 1500


[23-Jun-20 11:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[23-Jun-20 11:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[23-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435

[23-Jun-20 11:58 PM] bman#0435
2k?


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
idk but sometimes when people request for hrs/mrs


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
and they need chatlogs


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
the chatlogs would be gone by the time they join


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@Tattoblue Should we congratulate her?


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
so a little extra would be nice


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
what specifically


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
needed logs


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yes


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
like when is that usually the case


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Sometimes I go to look up what someone said and its already gone


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
when an lr needs to report someone but needs chatlog proof


[23-Jun-20 11:59 PM] bman#0435
so they call an mr/hr


[24-Jun-20 12:00 AM] Beartikal#9760
i c


[24-Jun-20 12:00 AM] bman#0435
im not saying that like we desperately need it but itd be nice


[24-Jun-20 12:06 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@KjRBLX shure if u want tu


[24-Jun-20 12:11 AM] KjRBLX#2053
U said she reported someone for being a donald trump supporter?


[24-Jun-20 12:11 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Oh


[24-Jun-20 12:11 AM] KjRBLX#2053

somebody should buy it and test it


[24-Jun-20 12:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
apparently basic admin blacklists this hat


[24-Jun-20 12:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
idk why


[24-Jun-20 12:46 AM] Beartikal#9760
oh


[24-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Beartikal#9760
its because its large


[24-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Beartikal#9760
so they remove it in game


[24-Jun-20 12:47 AM] Beartikal#9760
weird


[24-Jun-20 12:47 AM] KjRBLX#2053
they should allow the end users to do it themselves


[24-Jun-20 12:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
idk but its intertwined within their source code


[24-Jun-20 12:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
so its not changable unless i pull it out and manually change it


[24-Jun-20 12:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
just thought it was weird


[24-Jun-20 12:48 AM] Beartikal#9760
maybe furryfish doesnt like narwhals


[24-Jun-20 12:48 AM] Beartikal#9760

[24-Jun-20 12:51 AM] KjRBLX#2053
lol


[24-Jun-20 12:57 AM] bman#0435
lol i was good until i saw she had another group vice chairman make a statement for her


[24-Jun-20 12:57 AM] bman#0435
lmfaooooo


[24-Jun-20 01:01 AM] anna#0004
lmao


[24-Jun-20 01:01 AM] anna#0004
but i mean at the same time her appeal was pretty good and i do believe she‚Äôs changed into a better person


[24-Jun-20 01:02 AM] bman#0435
if it was so good she shouldnt need reassurance from a vice chairman of another group that knows nothing about her termination and blacklist


[24-Jun-20 01:02 AM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[24-Jun-20 01:05 AM] anna#0004
i think she just went that one step ahead, which wasn‚Äôt necessary I know, to prove how she‚Äôs changed but i genuinely think the part she wrote is good enough for us to gain back her trust


[24-Jun-20 01:05 AM] anna#0004
mhm


[24-Jun-20 01:05 AM] courtney#5125
yeah that‚Äôs why I reacted with a check


[24-Jun-20 01:06 AM] anna#0004
yeah that part was just unnecessary to add in really


[24-Jun-20 01:06 AM] courtney#5125
yes, that part abt the other groups wasn‚Äôt entirely necessary. however, the vast majority of her appeal is her explaining what she did, that she‚Äôs incredibly sorry, and her promise to never do those things again

do we plan on doing anything about armani bypassing in a pm?


[24-Jun-20 10:37 AM] stacey#1000
I would warn him


[24-Jun-20 10:37 AM] stacey#1000
I think since it was in a pm and over 2 weeks ago it‚Äôs a little too harsh to fire him


[24-Jun-20 10:37 AM] stacey#1000
Add a vote for it


[24-Jun-20 10:37 AM] courtney#5125
yeah true, but hannvhh was suspended for bypassing at interviews


[24-Jun-20 10:38 AM] stacey#1000
With options of suspending, warning, and firing


[24-Jun-20 10:38 AM] courtney#5125
alright, ill type it out nowww


[24-Jun-20 10:43 AM] stacey#1000
Once something gets 5 votes it‚Äôs good to go


[24-Jun-20 10:43 AM] courtney#5125
alright! if its a warning, thatd be a formal warning, right?

[24-Jun-20 07:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[24-Jun-20 07:20 PM] Beartikal#9760

[24-Jun-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
I really like the female HR uniform megan made I cant wait for it to be released


[24-Jun-20 07:23 PM] courtney#5125
yeah and i only sent the ones that hannah made bc nothing was ever mentioned publicly about when the uniforms were coming out, or if they were official, so im guessing thats the only reason hannah sent them to me. she just did them for fun


[24-Jun-20 07:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
its not letting me add people to a new board unless i make a Team

@impact hi so like ik u and bear r discussing new stuff for the server but id like if us hrs could also get to know what u guys r thinking and if can actually say our opinions abt it too


[24-Jun-20 09:52 PM] impact#0297
hi bman -- that's my job.. forward your thoughts to me.. here's what me and bear are talking about


[24-Jun-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
i dont think theres a need to rly privately discuss it between u and bear when we should also know wut u guys think abt it


[24-Jun-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
well ya ik that but i dont see y it should be an explicit decision between u and bear


[24-Jun-20 09:52 PM] impact#0297
1) hub for applications & anything submitted by members
2) former MR lounge
3) unbanning certain former HR's
4) reforms (vague ideas, nothing concrete)


[24-Jun-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
would be nice knowing what u guys plan on doing, y ur doing it, and when


[24-Jun-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435

[24-Jun-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297

[24-Jun-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
we have ongoing discussions blah blah blah back and fourth


[24-Jun-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
but the moment we have a decision point.. we will present it to HR's..


[24-Jun-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
we did that last week with HR's on the former HR chat


[24-Jun-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435
itd still be nice to know how u and bear think of things presented to us


[24-Jun-20 09:57 PM] bman#0435

also seeing that yall were straight forward for unbanning kayla, y not unban trey?!?!??!


[25-Jun-20 01:32 AM] stacey#1000
I understand you want to give people a second chance but I really don‚Äôt think it was a great idea unbanning Kayla. Trust me she‚Äôs got a lonnggg list of things she‚Äôs done in the past, I can speak from personal experience I did not have a fun experience witnessing who she really is. I really do not trust her at all.

She also dox‚Äôs people still....


[25-Jun-20 01:33 AM] bman#0435
ther was a reason not to appeal!!!!!!!


[25-Jun-20 01:33 AM] stacey#1000
She doxxed one of my good friends


[25-Jun-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
Then she also greats fake evidence against people


[25-Jun-20 01:34 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Kayla? Who dat?


[25-Jun-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
Really honestly I‚Äôm warning you this is a real bad idea to unban her


[25-Jun-20 01:34 AM] stacey#1000
Former HR Kayla

u remember her?


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Wasn't she just in the vc


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
Like she is just a person I would never appeal. She is one that has proved she doesn‚Äôt deserve another chance because she has done so many things and it actually hasn‚Äôt even been too too long since it occurred.


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] bman#0435
ya she was unbanned


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] bman#0435
even tho i said y we should! :)


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
She is a major threat to operations


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] stacey#1000
Like major major


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] bman#0435
she didnt even get to appeal, she was just


[25-Jun-20 01:35 AM] bman#0435
unbanned...


[25-Jun-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder I‚Äôm just warning you about Kayla. Trust me I‚Äôve had my own personal experience with her where she doxxed one of my good friends. This wasn‚Äôt long ago and I truly believe she is a threat to operations.  She didn‚Äôt appeal properly, but if you want to keep her unbanned I‚Äôll respect that.


[25-Jun-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm just saying she is really a threat to operations.


[25-Jun-20 01:37 AM] stacey#1000
She worked at other groups like Panda Express and also didn‚Äôt last long there.


[25-Jun-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs done a lot of stuff.


[25-Jun-20 01:38 AM] stacey#1000
Really don‚Äôt trust her at all.


[25-Jun-20 01:47 AM] ethan;#0003
Then she will have 0 mess ups


[25-Jun-20 01:47 AM] ethan;#0003
if she does one oopsie she will just get banned again


[25-Jun-20 01:47 AM] ethan;#0003
no warnings


[25-Jun-20 01:47 AM] ethan;#0003
or 0 chances


[25-Jun-20 01:47 AM] ethan;#0003
is what i mean


[25-Jun-20 01:47 AM] bman#0435
shes blacklisted and never even had to do an appeal...


[25-Jun-20 01:48 AM] ethan;#0003
i think ryan unbanned her idk


[25-Jun-20 01:48 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm just saying I really don‚Äôt trust she was unbanned. She can do stuff in DMs without us knowing about it


[25-Jun-20 01:48 AM] bman#0435
this is y ryan should have access to the boards to know who is/isnt blacklist and should get our opinions before every single decison is executed!


[25-Jun-20 01:48 AM] bman#0435
newsflash: we are called a team for a reason


[25-Jun-20 01:48 AM] stacey#1000
I have a really bad feeling about this


[25-Jun-20 01:49 AM] stacey#1000
She does stuff to people in DMs a lot. Like doxing, etc and making people scared to tell someone about it


[25-Jun-20 01:49 AM] stacey#1000
So chances are she will do something again and target people and we may never know


[25-Jun-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
@impact hi, can we please further discuss unbanning Kayla?


[25-Jun-20 01:50 AM] bman#0435
id also appreciate it if i didnt get "well see how it goes" as a response every single time


[25-Jun-20 01:50 AM] bman#0435
because we dont need to "see how it goes" to know the outcome


[25-Jun-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
She is a person I would‚Äôve never appealed. She‚Äôs done way too many things


[25-Jun-20 01:50 AM] stacey#1000
And if I‚Äôm being honest it wasn‚Äôt even that long ago


[25-Jun-20 01:52 AM] stacey#1000
Yes I understand people deserve a second chance but really. Kayla has done way too much to prove she shouldn‚Äôt ever be appealed. Like for example, we would never appeal Ava and meme correct? Well Kayla is on that scale of Ava and Meme


[25-Jun-20 01:52 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And she was a former HR?


[25-Jun-20 01:52 AM] stacey#1000
Yes but she did a lot


[25-Jun-20 01:53 AM] stacey#1000
She tried to dox jack, she successfully doxxed Megan. She creates fake evidence against those she doesn‚Äôt like and targets them with her friends, causing really a lot of drama. She tries to hack into peoples accounts. I got a long list


[25-Jun-20 01:53 AM] bman#0435
kj heres like a brief summary of her


[25-Jun-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
I honestly wish we discussed this more over just straight up unbanning her


[25-Jun-20 01:54 AM] bman#0435
terrorized mrs when someone would leak and threatened them
exploited, even at gamenights
doxxed
was SUPER biased
"accidentally" promoted someone to management


[25-Jun-20 01:54 AM] bman#0435
overall just toxic


[25-Jun-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
I wasn‚Äôt on earlier when the decision was made to unban her so


[25-Jun-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
Not to mention she leaked HR stuff


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
@KjRBLX ^


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
so ya


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
im not here to "be her boss" lmfao nty


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] stacey#1000
I really just don‚Äôt trust unbanning her


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
im not gonna terrorize her like she did to me and stacey


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
because im not like kayla


[25-Jun-20 01:55 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And all that just went under the radar for a while?


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] stacey#1000
Basically when she resigned we found out a lot more about what she did when she was actively an hr that would‚Äôve gotten her fired when she was an hr


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] Tattoblue#5828
she was never unbanned, shes on a new discord account


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] stacey#1000
And then she did a lot more after


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] bman#0435
so shes circumventing


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] bman#0435
nice!


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] bman#0435
now ban her


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] stacey#1000
So she is literally bypassing her ban....


[25-Jun-20 01:56 AM] bman#0435
üòç


[25-Jun-20 01:57 AM] stacey#1000
I had her discord blocked no wonder I can see her messages


[25-Jun-20 01:57 AM] bman#0435
u literally cant defend kayla tatto, theres no point


[25-Jun-20 01:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I don't think he was defending.


[25-Jun-20 01:57 AM] stacey#1000
If she‚Äôs bypassing her ban she already violated a rule


[25-Jun-20 01:58 AM] stacey#1000
Probably because she didn‚Äôt want people searching what she did on her other account tbh


[25-Jun-20 01:58 AM] Tattoblue#5828
i wasnt defending, i was just stating  a fact lol


[25-Jun-20 01:58 AM] bman#0435
o ok


[25-Jun-20 01:58 AM] bman#0435
but overall, not directed towards tatto, theres no defending kayla lol


[25-Jun-20 01:59 AM] stacey#1000
^^


[25-Jun-20 01:59 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs done way too much to prove otherwise


[25-Jun-20 01:59 AM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal can we ban Kayla again if possible?


[25-Jun-20 01:59 AM] bman#0435
after all, shes a circumventer :)


[25-Jun-20 01:59 AM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[25-Jun-20 02:00 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah she made a new discord account so...


[25-Jun-20 02:02 AM] bman#0435
i mean yall rly dug us all in a deep hole, and at this point letting former hrs circumvent their ban just to be in a former hr chat is allowed... y not just give every former hr their honor role because clearly everything was done for no reaosn!


[25-Jun-20 02:02 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôve stated all I needed to say about Kayla. I really don‚Äôt trust her and she is a threat to the group.


[25-Jun-20 02:02 AM] KjRBLX#2053
naw ion think they can get honor role


[25-Jun-20 02:03 AM] KjRBLX#2053
"Honor"


[25-Jun-20 02:03 AM] stacey#1000
If Kayla doesn‚Äôt have honour member role why is she allowed in the former hr chat?


[25-Jun-20 02:03 AM] bman#0435
and to no let us even vote on that... we all (not sure abt kj tho) experienced **hell** with her... theres a reason she is BLACKLISTED. if u cant see that, then thats NOT my fault, because maybe waiting at least 24 hours instead of 24 seconds to see others opinions would be nice


[25-Jun-20 02:03 AM] bman#0435
@KjRBLX it was kinda a reference lol.


[25-Jun-20 02:03 AM] bman#0435
like saying if ur letting them get around bans then let them get their honor role too while theyre at it


[25-Jun-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
I agree with what Bman said. If we could‚Äôve had a vote so we could‚Äôve discussed unbanning her further before she was actually unbanned that would‚Äôve been great. I wasn‚Äôt online when the decision was made to allow her in the server


[25-Jun-20 02:05 AM] stacey#1000
Ok that‚Äôs all I need to say for now. Im warning you about Kayla, that‚Äôs my point.


[25-Jun-20 02:06 AM] bman#0435
ill have more to say by tomorrow since its 3 am and my brain isnt functioning :)

i strongly disagree with her getting former


[25-Jun-20 02:50 AM] ethan;#0003
especially if there will be a former lounge


[25-Jun-20 02:50 AM] ethan;#0003
no way


[25-Jun-20 02:50 AM] ethan;#0003
she doesnt disserve it


[25-Jun-20 02:50 AM] ethan;#0003
she got it taken away for a reason


[25-Jun-20 02:50 AM] bman#0435
theres no former mr lounge comingvany time soon


[25-Jun-20 02:51 AM] ethan;#0003
there are some former mr's who have the role who shouldn't be rewarded with the former lounge


[25-Jun-20 02:51 AM] ethan;#0003
if that ever becomes a thing we should go through the formers


[25-Jun-20 02:52 AM] ethan;#0003
because some people shouldnt be rewarded for what they have done


[25-Jun-20 02:52 AM] ethan;#0003
but somehow still have the former role

[25-Jun-20 11:07 AM] stacey#1000
Guys pls tell me what you think about what I announced lol


[25-Jun-20 11:11 AM] courtney#5125
@stacey i think making it manager+ is definitely a good idea. managers are the ones reviewing reports all the time, so theyre the ones that need to have an EXACT idea of whos a cb and whos not. a head can report who they think, but they really dont need to have any kind of final say on it, since theyre not the ones adding it to a board, if that makes any sense


[25-Jun-20 11:13 AM] courtney#5125
like its helpful for heads to have access to it, but if theyre the ones leaking it, then theres no point to having a cb doc at all if its just gonna keep getting out


[25-Jun-20 11:13 AM] courtney#5125
so manager+ is pretty good


[25-Jun-20 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
The only with heads is when they are actually at the hotel they may not know who is a cb or not but like I‚Äôm tired of it getting leaked


[25-Jun-20 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
They can always ask a manager+ to confirm if they are a cb or not though


[25-Jun-20 11:20 AM] katie#0200
i think that heads would become a lot more confused and dislike going on shifts because they dont know who to kick, we cant really punish the whole head team and make their job harder just because a few people have leaked it before


[25-Jun-20 11:21 AM] katie#0200
getting a manager+ to confirm would be kinda time consuming as well


[25-Jun-20 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
The main question is do we really still need a cb list. It just makes cbs want to get on the list causes more cbs


[25-Jun-20 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
cbs like really annoying so like I guess I‚Äôm saying maybe there is a better way we can handle them


[25-Jun-20 11:22 AM] katie#0200
true, perhaps we could still have a list so that our MRs dont become clueless on who's a CB or not, maybe just not on a google document that can be easily shared around


[25-Jun-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah because the link can get shared a lot but I‚Äôm not sure how else we could have a cb list


[25-Jun-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
The cb list itself just honestly encourages more cbs


[25-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
Since they know there is a list and want to get onto the list


[25-Jun-20 11:24 AM] katie#0200
true but we shouldnt remove it in hopes that less CBs will appear


[25-Jun-20 11:24 AM] katie#0200
well not entirely remove it


[25-Jun-20 11:24 AM] stacey#1000
There will always be cbs but like how did it get to this bad for cbs. We didn‚Äôt have it like this in the past


[25-Jun-20 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
Cbs really are frustrating


[25-Jun-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
We removed the cb rule before, maybe we can do it again and only ban people that actually bypass and spam and stuff. Idek


[25-Jun-20 11:26 AM] bman#0435
heads always determine who they want to be cbs and its so annoying üôÑ


[25-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
like i took the time to make the doc for u


[25-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
so... use it üòçüòç


[25-Jun-20 11:27 AM] katie#0200
idk if thats the best idea, with all of the CBs now it would make going on shifts a pain


[25-Jun-20 11:27 AM] bman#0435
but nah its been leaked too many times


[25-Jun-20 11:27 AM] courtney#5125
if someone has bacon hair and a low account age, theyre the same as a cb pfjdklfjsa


[25-Jun-20 11:27 AM] courtney#5125
:facepalm:


[25-Jun-20 11:28 AM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 do an actual reaction please :)


[25-Jun-20 11:28 AM] katie#0200
i think we should come up with another way to have the list instead of on a document, we cant just remove it and make heads' jobs harder because some people have leaked it


[25-Jun-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I think account age is a huge issue for this. I just really wish there was a better way we could deal with cbs. If we removed banning people for being a cb and actually banned them for if they bypass and stuff maybe it would help idk


[25-Jun-20 11:28 AM] bman#0435
i mean anything with the heads will get leaked lmao


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
tbh what if daisy leaked it


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
They thrive off of the attention of getting kicked as soon as they join a server


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
or a former


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Bman how do I give you the cb list


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435

[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435

[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
no


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
@bman I did do an actual reaction please :)


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
share


[25-Jun-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
and add me to it


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bman#0435
and then change perms to owner


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
Do you want to just make a new one again and I‚Äôll delete the old one


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bman#0435
a shrug wasnt a reaction stacey put for the vote


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bman#0435
ye ill make a new one


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
Like just copy and paste it and make a new doc again


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bman#0435
dont delete rn tho


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
No I won‚Äôt rn


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
My reaction is showing that I wish to choose abstain as I do not have an opinion in the matter but would like to acknowledge that I have seen the vote so I don't look like I'm ignoring it.


[25-Jun-20 11:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
Do you have a problem with that?


[25-Jun-20 11:31 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 noob


[25-Jun-20 11:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
Hi stacey


[25-Jun-20 11:31 AM] bman#0435
no


[25-Jun-20 11:32 AM] bonnie591#0591
Then please don't ask me to do an actual reaction when I've already done one.


[25-Jun-20 11:32 AM] bman#0435
well usually if were unsure abt what we wanna vote we tell that person and get other opinions


[25-Jun-20 11:32 AM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[25-Jun-20 11:33 AM] bman#0435
and by ‚Äúthat person‚Äù i mean the vote conductor


[25-Jun-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000
Ok so for now we can just make a new cb list again and then we can discuss cbs again later


[25-Jun-20 11:37 AM] bonnie591#0591
Usually I don't even vote on these topics anyway, I'm just voting abstain to show that I do not have an opinion on it and that I'm not ignoring Stacey.


[25-Jun-20 11:46 AM] courtney#5125

[25-Jun-20 11:49 AM] bman#0435

@stacey ya i think managers could be more trusted with it, we can see how that goes and if its still getting leaked then no point in keep updating it


[25-Jun-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
Oki! Yeah I‚Äôm going to bring this topic up during the next meeting possibly. For now Bman made a new document


[25-Jun-20 12:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I think making manager+ may be the better option if it keeps getting leaked since they‚Äôre more trusted

im pretty sure he dmed me before i saw him bypass in-game


[25-Jun-20 07:31 PM] courtney#5125
like several minutes before


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] courtney#5125
it was weird bc he was working just like normal and being a good worker and then leaves, rejoins, and bypasses :/


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
i mean


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435

üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] courtney#5125
vedom was hacked when he bypassed?


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
nope


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] courtney#5125
OH


[25-Jun-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
but he worked, rejoined, bypassed, got banned


[25-Jun-20 07:33 PM] courtney#5125
well he ended up dming an mr saying he was mad at baby and bear so he bypassed


[25-Jun-20 07:33 PM] courtney#5125
hey_upalxrt never had an excuse like that, he just dmed me saying he was hacked, then his account bypassed


[25-Jun-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435

[25-Jun-20 07:34 PM] courtney#5125

right


[25-Jun-20 07:34 PM] courtney#5125
idk i just dont see the harm in giving him the benefit of the doubt. if he keeps getting "hacked" then obviously its not true but

[25-Jun-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760

[25-Jun-20 09:10 PM] courtney#5125

[25-Jun-20 09:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
People that just follow me to other games all the time after I friend them are just uncomfortable to me


[25-Jun-20 09:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053

TheBuilder keeps spamming me with promo suggestions


[25-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
he accepts them so he sends whatever he gets


[25-Jun-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435

[25-Jun-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000

@katie he also muted jessie for apparently 30 seconds as a joke yesterday but she said was longer than that, and i had reminded him to only mute for valid reasons

Yeah yikes


[26-Jun-20 10:08 AM] anna#0004

yeahh


[26-Jun-20 12:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
but why


[26-Jun-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
It hides them using admin commands


[26-Jun-20 12:42 PM] courtney#5125
right


[26-Jun-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
Like an admin command bar but for mobile


[26-Jun-20 12:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
i removd it because exploiters also use it to hide their commands i guess ill have to make it staff-onl


[26-Jun-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
Make it MRs only


[26-Jun-20 01:01 PM] stacey#1000
@katie regarding what you announced to Connor, maybe make an investigation card regarding it and then question him about it. I can question him if you wish.


[26-Jun-20 01:02 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn Hi sir, update on the daisy case, like has she been questioned about leaking the senior board possibly?


[26-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
and when is aerualie being demoted


[26-Jun-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
Who‚Äôs that


[26-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
an mr that shouldve been demoted last month


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I can question daisy if you haven‚Äôt yet. We shouldn‚Äôt keep it waiting for too long.


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
she specifically hasnt been questioned yet


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
but that case intervenes with another leaking case


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
that involves lauren, the person who reported it


[26-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
so its being investigated yes, just taking a little longer


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Do you think Lauren leaked too?


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
well the thing is


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Alright that‚Äôs okay didn‚Äôt know it was about another case too


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Just if you need help with it lmk


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
theres something to suggest lauren is leaking, but the report against daisy also suggests shes leaking


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
so we're trying to found out which one leaked


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
and whether one is framing the other


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
if u get what im saying


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] bman#0435
min sir


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes?


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] bman#0435
when is aerualie getting demoted


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Oh that makes sense


[26-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821

[26-Jun-20 01:06 PM] bman#0435
she has no notice


[26-Jun-20 01:06 PM] bman#0435
and she was supposed to be demoted lastmontj


[26-Jun-20 01:06 PM] bman#0435
!!!!!


[26-Jun-20 01:06 PM] stacey#1000
How about the Jessie case? I can question her regarding that if you wish


[26-Jun-20 01:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes stacey


[26-Jun-20 01:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
the jessie case is all yours


[26-Jun-20 01:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
just keep me updated


[26-Jun-20 01:09 PM] xM_inn#2821

[26-Jun-20 02:08 PM] ethan;#0003
And his immaturity


[26-Jun-20 02:08 PM] ethan;#0003
And how he didn‚Äôt listen to the requirements for mrs and ignores clarity when she said there was too many


[26-Jun-20 02:08 PM] ethan;#0003
And tatto told him he can‚Äôt stay


[26-Jun-20 02:09 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn


[26-Jun-20 02:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
add a report card to the HR board about it


[26-Jun-20 02:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
with all proof and stuff


[26-Jun-20 02:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
and it'll be looked into soon


[26-Jun-20 02:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan;


[26-Jun-20 02:10 PM] ethan;#0003
I‚Äôm not home rn I‚Äôll do it later


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] ethan;#0003
And some stuff like his immaturity I do t have proof for


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] ethan;#0003
But tatto and I have both seen it


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; did you question him about it?


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] ethan;#0003
I‚Äôve told him to stop before


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
You should talk to him about it


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] ethan;#0003
I will later


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[26-Jun-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
He may need a suspension this is not his first occurrence


[26-Jun-20 02:12 PM] ethan;#0003
I was thinking a warning


[26-Jun-20 02:12 PM] ethan;#0003
Like a firm one


[26-Jun-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
He was warned for stuff like this before tho


[26-Jun-20 02:13 PM] ethan;#0003
Oh


[26-Jun-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying suspension


[26-Jun-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
Since he‚Äôs had a record for it


[26-Jun-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Jun-20 02:21 PM] stacey#1000
Or former manager


[26-Jun-20 02:22 PM] Polk#1596

[26-Jun-20 03:02 PM] KjRBLX#2053
This is not the first time Connor has made disturbing comments in the vc.


[26-Jun-20 03:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
People in vc were playing arsenal and he tends to rage and he said something along the lines i believe hoping someone dies

[26-Jun-20 03:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Ethan brought that up a couple days a go


[26-Jun-20 03:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah. I know Im just reintroducing the topic.


[26-Jun-20 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
Given Jessie has had issues before, I think a 3 day suspension for her actions would be good. She should‚Äôve known already not to act inappropriate.


[26-Jun-20 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
Either a suspension or heavy warning. I lean more towards a suspension.


[26-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Cam#5887
suspension, i don‚Äôt really agree with a warning due to the fact that she has been suspended before, plus, she should know not to be doing that stuff since she‚Äôs an MR. it‚Äôs unacceptable behavior, especially when she is more than likely lying about her answers


[26-Jun-20 03:49 PM] Cam#5887
with this being said, 5 day suspension


[26-Jun-20 03:49 PM] Cam#5887
is what i think


[26-Jun-20 03:50 PM] stacey#1000
Not to mention instead of owning up to her actions she seemed to make up excuses as to why or ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt see is as inappropriate and was joking around because they are good friends‚Äù


[26-Jun-20 03:51 PM] Cam#5887
haha, exactly


[26-Jun-20 03:51 PM] bman#0435
She also claimed she wasn't active in private servers but I got this report 5 days ago lol.


[26-Jun-20 03:51 PM] Cam#5887
it‚Äôs not appropriate either way


[26-Jun-20 03:51 PM] Cam#5887
okay so she IS LYING


[26-Jun-20 03:51 PM] Cam#5887
without a doubt then


[26-Jun-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
Yes so for sure a suspension seems most valid


[26-Jun-20 03:52 PM] Cam#5887
extremely


[26-Jun-20 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe one of the new HRs will get a chance to do their first MR suspension!!

@courtney @KjRBLX if either of you would like to suspend Jessie let me know! You would just have to send her a suspension letter then actually suspend her


[26-Jun-20 03:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
agreed with suspension


[26-Jun-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Jun-20 04:03 PM] bman#0435
well she basically did this


[26-Jun-20 04:03 PM] bman#0435
Encouraging ODing, threatening to make docs, inappropriate behavior in a private server.


[26-Jun-20 04:03 PM] bman#0435
and lied to me


[26-Jun-20 04:03 PM] bman#0435

[26-Jun-20 04:04 PM] xM_inn#2821

Yes^


[26-Jun-20 04:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I was about to ask what we were gonna do about connor


[26-Jun-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
Connor should be questioned about his behaviour and then go from there


[26-Jun-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
See what he says, since right now we only have witness statements and no solid evidence


[26-Jun-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821

[26-Jun-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821

Greetings cIaritvvy,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as Head of Services at Bloxton Hotels as of Friday, June 26th at 4:14 PM CST. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to inappropriate behavior in a private server and encouraging online dating. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude on Monday, June 29th at 4:14 PM CST, and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Best regards,

@courtney look at this greatest response ever to a inactivity letter. Responds really late on the last day of his activity watch 2 weeks later.

[26-Jun-20 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
Best response of 2020


[26-Jun-20 04:25 PM] courtney#5125
im just wondering why he had to edit it..


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] courtney#5125
any response had to be better than "i"


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
He edited it to have no grammar


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] courtney#5125
..........


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] courtney#5125
what the heck


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
So yeah basically Darren wanted to resign on July 31st right


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
But he was doing nothing as a senior


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] courtney#5125
right


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
So we basically told him to get active or resign now


[26-Jun-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
He resigned


[26-Jun-20 04:27 PM] courtney#5125
wow


[26-Jun-20 04:27 PM] courtney#5125
i still dont know why he wanted to plan out his resignation in the first place, that always confused me LOL


[26-Jun-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
There was really no point in him to continue being a senior for 2 months doing nothing if he was going to resign anyways


[26-Jun-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
Yes he bragged about it


[26-Jun-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
But it didn‚Äôt turn out the way he wanted :)))


[26-Jun-20 04:28 PM] courtney#5125
right, if he was going to do nothing up until his planned resignation, why wouldnt he have just resigned right then


[26-Jun-20 04:28 PM] courtney#5125
yeah ig not !

[26-Jun-20 06:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
the new command will be !uniformM and !uniformF for male and female


[26-Jun-20 06:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
if you say !uniform it will default to Male

[26-Jun-20 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk yes


[26-Jun-20 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
Noob I did use gear 10 for half of it


[26-Jun-20 06:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
@ethan; there's no actual way to tell if a player is safechat from Code


[26-Jun-20 06:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
the ones in basic admin are Rough estimates and should never be used to reliably tell if they are or aren't safechat, hence safechat tests.


[26-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
he was asking because he wants to promote that person but theyre security


[26-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
so he doesnt know if theyre safe to promote or not


[26-Jun-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; go on a random alt acc when they are at the hotel and ask them how do you tell if you have safechat and if they say c7rn you‚Äôre good


[26-Jun-20 06:56 PM] ethan;#0003
when she was afk


[26-Jun-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve done that once


[26-Jun-20 06:56 PM] ethan;#0003
i did it


[26-Jun-20 06:56 PM] ethan;#0003
she doesnt have safechat


[26-Jun-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
Oki


[26-Jun-20 06:59 PM] courtney#5125
@ethan; didnt jigglypuff762 retrain to security just a few days ago


[26-Jun-20 06:59 PM] ethan;#0003
oof


[26-Jun-20 06:59 PM] ethan;#0003
a few mrs in the call


[26-Jun-20 06:59 PM] ethan;#0003
said she was active


[26-Jun-20 06:59 PM] ethan;#0003
and they saw her alot


[26-Jun-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
yeah no doubt she is, i see her a lot


[26-Jun-20 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
so it gave me the idea to promote her maybe


[26-Jun-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
but she got her rank less than a month ago


[26-Jun-20 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
in my personal opinion, i think she could definitely be an mr someday, but she needs a bit more time in her position


[26-Jun-20 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
https://trello.com/c/4ujiNrue/206451-jigglypuff762-6-using-morphs i see she got reported for this but this report is invalid


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
they are supposed to tell the user that they cant use the morph


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
and include that in the photo


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
include the user refusing


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
what


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
no ur mixing up no clothing


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
and morphs


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i hate how ppl get reported for literally just being in the wrong morph


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
i made the announcement


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[26-Jun-20 07:01 PM] bman#0435
who would refuse to take off a morph-


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] courtney#5125
someone who wants to get in trouble


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] ethan;#0003
people who dont get told to take it off


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] bman#0435
bruh ive never seen that


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] ethan;#0003
i think i need to reannounce it


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] ethan;#0003
ive seen those reports a lot


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] courtney#5125
its a little unfair to warn someone for just being in a kid morph. a lot of times, while its a very old rule, new staff members dont know u cant use it


[26-Jun-20 07:02 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[26-Jun-20 07:03 PM] courtney#5125
and, yes this could be a little far-fetched, but it couldve always been a misclick, and someone just got proof of u in it right away ://


[26-Jun-20 07:03 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe we have a vote since we are laxing the rules to remove the morph rule


[26-Jun-20 07:05 PM] ethan;#0003
@Hilton Founder can i make a vote on that to get the hr's opinions? ^


[26-Jun-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
ngl that rule sucks


[26-Jun-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
like seriously they morph into a kid and BAM warned


[26-Jun-20 07:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
its stupid


[26-Jun-20 07:06 PM] ethan;#0003
I made a rule that they are required to show proof of them asking to take off the morph


[26-Jun-20 07:06 PM] ethan;#0003
but nobody follows that


[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] ethan;#0003
becuase when people get reported for that 99% of the time they dont know they arent allowed to use the morph


[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
because they are brainwashed to get promotions by being snitches, not by going to the hotel
that's what the "Reports" system has done.


[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] ethan;#0003
OMG YES


[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760

[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] ethan;#0003
IKR


[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] ethan;#0003
THEY THINK IF THEY SNITCH ON THEIR FRIENDS THEY GET PROMOTED


[26-Jun-20 07:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
then the MRs: "oh but we use that to see who to promote"


[26-Jun-20 07:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
BRUH


[26-Jun-20 07:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
NO


[26-Jun-20 07:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yep


[26-Jun-20 07:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats like saying "i want snitches in my MR + HR Ranks!"


[26-Jun-20 07:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
so the question is WHY


[26-Jun-20 07:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Friend: "Why did you snitch me?"
Person: "I wanted to get promoted."


[26-Jun-20 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
@Beartikal do you know if we getting uniforms soon


[26-Jun-20 07:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
baby can hand them out today ill ask him


[26-Jun-20 07:09 PM] ethan;#0003
Friend: "I will send you a picture of me using a morph"
Person: "Sure since you are my bff I wont send it to anyone"

5 minutes later:

Person reports friend in staff reports


[26-Jun-20 07:09 PM] Beartikal#9760

@Hilton Founder An MR said guests can access the uniform commands at the IC, would it be possible to fix this and make it MR-only once again?

When every time you join a hotel server and within 3 mins people ask who you are promoting.  Bruh


[26-Jun-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
ok so ya it checked if their rank was lower than 4, guests included my bad


[26-Jun-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I just copy pasted code without realizing I forgot to not include lower ranks


[26-Jun-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I just fixed them now real quick by moving some code around


[26-Jun-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
should be good now


[26-Jun-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563

@here ok TC and IC are fixed


[26-Jun-20 10:04 PM] babymariobebe#7563
uniforms should be good now


[26-Jun-20 10:05 PM] impact#0297
@babymariobebe is it !uniformM and !uniformF?


[26-Jun-20 10:05 PM] impact#0297
does it work on the hotel too


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
no hotel automatically equips no need for a command


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
and yes check the command board


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
its M and F


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
!uniform works too


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
but it defaults to Male


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
so females must use !uniformF if they desire a female uniform


[26-Jun-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
males can in theory just use !uniform but !uniformM is the proper command


[26-Jun-20 10:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
uniform! uniform! uniform! (: @babymariobebe

less staff = more promotion op

more promotion op = less fake reports

[27-Jun-20 02:32 AM] stacey#1000

[27-Jun-20 02:33 AM] stacey#1000
shes gone thankfully


[27-Jun-20 02:33 AM] stacey#1000
called it shes toxic as heck and I know because she hates me and made me her personal target :))


[27-Jun-20 02:33 AM] Beartikal#9760
how long was she an hr for


[27-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
like a year almost but when she was an HR she did stuff that wouldve gotten her fired if you knew about it when she was HR


[27-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
but yes never appeal her no matter how many years its been


[27-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
she is just not a good person trust me


[27-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
she doxxed megan


[27-Jun-20 02:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
dont know how she stayed that long if shes as bad as you say


[27-Jun-20 02:34 AM] stacey#1000
shes really bad like i dont understand how she is this toxic


[27-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
she leaked HR stuff when she was an HR


[27-Jun-20 02:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
why did nobody do anything to her lol


[27-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
idk how she wasnt fired lol


[27-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
she also encouraged inappropriate behaviour


[27-Jun-20 02:35 AM] stacey#1000
like she shouldve been fired but good shes gone now


[27-Jun-20 02:36 AM] stacey#1000
just note to NEVER unban her again she really is a risk to the group


[27-Jun-20 02:36 AM] stacey#1000
I knew it she never changed


[27-Jun-20 02:37 AM] stacey#1000
this will sum up kayla for you


[27-Jun-20 02:37 AM] stacey#1000
kayla: doesnt like you and targets you to try to get you either falsely fired, or expose your personal information, or try hacking into your account

[27-Jun-20 03:07 AM] stacey#1000
Maybe we should make an announcement to everyone about people going around impersonating HRs and to not fall for  it and to always double check the discord tag


[27-Jun-20 03:09 AM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder you should be aware of this too. People will probably impersonate you too jsyk


[27-Jun-20 03:09 AM] stacey#1000

It‚Äôs annoying idk who is impersonating HRs to make people think they are getting promoted


[27-Jun-20 03:16 AM] stacey#1000
I feel bad people get hopes up for nothing


[27-Jun-20 03:16 AM] Beartikal#9760
they do worse with baby, they do scamming and account theft "give me your account to verify your activity to get a promotion"


[27-Jun-20 03:17 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LMAO wth


[27-Jun-20 03:17 AM] stacey#1000

IMPERSONATING HRS

Greetings, everyone! 

Currently, there is people going around impersonating HRs on discord. A user with the same discord name and profile picture  may DM you claiming you are getting promoted. They make it seem a lot like they are the real HR to trick you.  

Please know this is 100% fake. A good way to double check is by the discord tag. No one can get the exact same discord tag as the real HRs, so be sure to double check the discord tag. If you do get a DM from anyone impersonating an HR, it is best to block the person ASAP because they are not who they say they are. Also, HRs usually promote people in game, not over discord, that is another way to tell if it is fake or not. We try to make promotions fun by announcing it on servers to catch people off guard. Be safe everyone and don‚Äôt fall for these impersonators. Have a good rest of your day/night!

Best regards,

Yes the message thing looks good


[27-Jun-20 03:23 AM] stacey#1000
A lot better than the basic ones we have rn


[27-Jun-20 03:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
o k


[27-Jun-20 03:23 AM] Beartikal#9760
oh


[27-Jun-20 03:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[27-Jun-20 03:24 AM] Beartikal#9760
basic admin too basic


[27-Jun-20 03:24 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôm announcing now


[27-Jun-20 03:25 AM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[27-Jun-20 03:25 AM] KjRBLX#2053
well its in the name


[27-Jun-20 03:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
correct


[27-Jun-20 03:25 AM] Beartikal#9760
but its programming backend needs some work
--


[27-Jun-20 03:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
for instance, the "View" command takes approximately 0.2-0.3 seconds to run, while its hardily noticeable, for lower end pcs it becomes obvious

with my admin system, it's about 0.0027 seconds to use ;view


[27-Jun-20 03:26 AM] Beartikal#9760
things like that


[27-Jun-20 03:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
a little code reworking can do quite a lot


[27-Jun-20 03:28 AM] Beartikal#9760


[27-Jun-20 03:32 AM] KjRBLX#2053
i mean wouldnt it just take


[27-Jun-20 03:33 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Changing the ..hold on let me test this


[27-Jun-20 03:34 AM] Beartikal#9760
``Basic Admin:`` (View command) Client --> Server --> Self
``My Admin:`` (View command) Client - Self


[27-Jun-20 03:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
where each --> represents 0.1 second


[27-Jun-20 03:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[27-Jun-20 03:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053
wouldn't it just take find who they said


[27-Jun-20 03:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053
and changing the camera subject


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
basic admin (for every command) goes to the Server first to verify the user's credentials (a complete waste of time for ;View)


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
so thats why it takes time with basic admin


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
we are waiting for a server response


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
before we set the camera subject


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
with my admin, there's no waiting involved.


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
see


[27-Jun-20 03:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
with my admin i check on the client - no need to go to the server as the server already told us what our credentials are.


[27-Jun-20 03:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
the server will also update us of any credential change


[27-Jun-20 03:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
much bettr


[27-Jun-20 03:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
but yeah kj your right


[27-Jun-20 03:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
its just the way basic admin did it


[27-Jun-20 03:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
that makes it take time


[27-Jun-20 03:41 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I was gonna say wouldn't you have to call the server to figure out a accurate character because :name command changes the model name but I seen that Humanoid has property called Display Name


[27-Jun-20 03:42 AM] stacey#1000

yup!Q


[27-Jun-20 10:58 AM] bman#0435
its offensive and derogatory!


[27-Jun-20 10:58 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I know it‚Äôs offensive


[27-Jun-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
yes


[27-Jun-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
we know lol dont worry Kj, we dont think ur stupid


[27-Jun-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
:D


[27-Jun-20 10:59 AM] bman#0435
i thought people knew not to use the n word in the reports server, so i dont think theres a need to announce it. we ban people who use it, fired/demoted people who used it in the past


[27-Jun-20 10:59 AM] bman#0435
and to be clear, im refering to trey when he said the n word as an mr and got demoted from his position


[27-Jun-20 10:59 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Im flabbergasted


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] Cam#5887
well legit any use of RACIST terms are unacceptable without a doubt


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] courtney#5125
if they're still using it after an announcement, then im sure more severe punishments can be dealt out


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] bman#0435
but there are probably more people who got demoted/fured for it


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] Cam#5887
but its racist........................

oooo


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] bman#0435
i dont think an announxement about literally one of the most offensive words need to be made


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] KjRBLX#2053
That was fast


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] bman#0435
its fairly obvious not to use it


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] courtney#5125
staceys speedy


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] stacey#1000
Let me edit it


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] stacey#1000
One min


[27-Jun-20 11:00 AM] courtney#5125
we could at least give them fair warning, which would be the announcement


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Unless this happen before üò¢


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] bman#0435
can we vote on an announcement for like just ‚Äúretard‚Äù or both n word and ‚Äúretard‚Äù


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] Cam#5887
yes please


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] bman#0435
because cam and i disagree with an announcement being necessary for the n word


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] Cam#5887
id like to vote on this announcement ngl


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] Cam#5887

[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] Cam#5887
but its just...


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] bman#0435
but the n word, i thought itd be obvious


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] Cam#5887
the n word is offensive and racist


[27-Jun-20 11:01 AM] Cam#5887
thats the BIGGEST CONCERN


[27-Jun-20 11:02 AM] bman#0435
also which mrs have been saying it


[27-Jun-20 11:02 AM] Cam#5887

[27-Jun-20 11:02 AM] stacey#1000

[27-Jun-20 11:02 AM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 11:02 AM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 11:02 AM] stacey#1000
Addie also doesn‚Äôt have evidence she just informed me


[27-Jun-20 11:03 AM] stacey#1000
Arty was already warned so


[27-Jun-20 11:03 AM] stacey#1000

[27-Jun-20 11:03 AM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 11:03 AM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 11:03 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve gotten a lot of complaints about people using the word ‚Äúretarded‚Äù too


[27-Jun-20 11:03 AM] bman#0435
asking for a friend üòÅüòÅ


[27-Jun-20 11:04 AM] Cam#5887
well the term "Retarded" is not acceptable either, as we all know


[27-Jun-20 11:04 AM] stacey#1000

[27-Jun-20 11:05 AM] stacey#1000
Alright

Kayla: doesn‚Äôt like you, makes you her own personal target to try to get you falsely fired, trash talks you, doxes you or your friends, tries to hack into your account. 

SHE DID THIS TO ME WHEN I GOT MANAGEMENT LEGIT

Okay, this past week I worked on a draft training guide for each rank, and this week I want to perfect it and fix any errors with it. I also want to hopefully promote someone I've been looking at, along with getting some more applications read (maybe 50).

Yep I like the former HR chat


[27-Jun-20 12:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
The way they acted in general discussion.. I don't think they're ready for it. But I am still willing to give it a trial run for a couple days


[27-Jun-20 12:12 PM] katie#0200
i feel like some people will ruin it, theres a lot more of them but we could still give it a shot


[27-Jun-20 12:12 PM] courtney#5125

[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
lolll


[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] courtney#5125
i mean there have been a few times where a head asks for permission to kick a staff member, but then its not even something worth doing anything more than warning


[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] katie#0200
i think its because heads dont know if their reports gonna get accepted or not so


[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] ethan;#0003
can we talk about how mrs ALWAYS tag an hr as soon as someone gets three kicks instead of putting it on the manager board or in staff reports


[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] courtney#5125
but that could easily happen with managers too


[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] courtney#5125
with them reporting and kicking when they dont need to


[27-Jun-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435
YES ETHAN IKR


[27-Jun-20 12:24 PM] katie#0200
i mean like my point was that we never actually announced it


[27-Jun-20 12:24 PM] courtney#5125
didnt emma make an announcement thats pinned abt that, ethan


[27-Jun-20 12:24 PM] katie#0200
so a lot of them dont know


[27-Jun-20 12:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
well i think if you put a suspension request / staff report up and they are causing distruption to the game (if they are abusing their housekeeping tools then ofc no kick but like cuff abusing or spamming yes) then they should be able to kick them without having to ask


[27-Jun-20 12:24 PM] anna#0004
recently theyve been asking a lot to kick staff and its always just a yes answer anyway, i think they should be allowed


[27-Jun-20 12:24 PM] Cam#5887
i think they should be allowed too


[27-Jun-20 12:25 PM] bman#0435

seniors: im ok with


[27-Jun-20 12:25 PM] anna#0004
ya senior


[27-Jun-20 12:25 PM] katie#0200
yes seniors


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
seniors go to banning sessions, they know how stuff like that works


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
even tho its not pban but


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
still ban


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah seniors are more trusted than managers


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
right


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
There's a lot more managers than seniors


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Cam#5887
yeah seniors to server ban not pban


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] Cam#5887
i agree w/ that


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah i think seniors should get server ban but what would also be good is like a temp ban where seniors can ban people temp for up to x amount of hours because we can sometimes take a long time to do pban requests


[27-Jun-20 12:26 PM] bman#0435
but not all servers have someone that need to be banned


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
well bad thing is bonnie, there is no command on basic admin with tempban


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] courtney#5125
usually its only like the top 4 servers that are really busy


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] ethan;#0003
i like that idea


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
We could trial it


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] courtney#5125
we could


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
And see how it goes


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
ryan, we dont have a tempban command tho


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
unless one is made


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] impact#0297
yes we do


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] impact#0297
:ban works


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
WAT


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
oh


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] impact#0297
:pban doesn't work


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] impact#0297
that's perm


[27-Jun-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
but that wont unban them?


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
like a tempban


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
once the time ends, they are unbanned


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
they have a fetish for getting banned


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] katie#0200
:ban is just server ban, they can just join another server


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that‚Äôs true cause no troller will go to an empty server with no staff


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
im aware


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well bear is making an admin so just suggest it to him


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
ye


[27-Jun-20 12:28 PM] Cam#5887
but like i was saying, if we are going to temp ban someone, would that be tracked on the MB?


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] courtney#5125
yeah thats true, if they dont have to worry about huge spammers like gordan joining (even tho hes kinda gone) then they might enjoy staying at the hotel for longer


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
ban logging channel


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
exactly


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
SizzleBurger allows their MRs to server ban except training assistant, so we could try it with managers and seniors


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
we already have a channel for ban logging


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
But like if it gets abusive, we need to reconsider


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435
so they can just put it in there


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] Cam#5887
well, there are also bots that can actually log any bans in a discord server


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] courtney#5125
i still think it should only be senior


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah, SizzleBurger have a custom mod panel too


[27-Jun-20 12:29 PM] bman#0435

@stacey what'd u say


[27-Jun-20 12:30 PM] bman#0435
didnt all staff have admin


[27-Jun-20 12:30 PM] ethan;#0003
in v3 seniors had admin


[27-Jun-20 12:30 PM] bman#0435
like when they used ;clip and ;noclip


[27-Jun-20 12:30 PM] ethan;#0003
that was like v2


[27-Jun-20 12:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If im not mistaken..staff like recep had mod


[27-Jun-20 12:31 PM] Tattoblue#5828
but V3 only had like 2 servers up at once so it was easier for moderation we didnt get as much people as we do now


[27-Jun-20 12:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
^


[27-Jun-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591

[27-Jun-20 12:32 PM] anna#0004
ppl will complain ab lag


[27-Jun-20 12:32 PM] ethan;#0003
lag


[27-Jun-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
would be cool but lag


[27-Jun-20 12:32 PM] bman#0435
30 is already pretty hectic


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
I wouldn't mind something like 40


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
200???


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but the little we go the more servers we have


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
put it to 200!


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
50 is woah!


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
LOL bonnie


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
right bloo


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
Bigger servers mean more opportunity, like more people during events etc


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
lets do 1 people servers


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LOL


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bman#0435
more servers!


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] courtney#5125
ok min yeah u make a good point


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats good idea


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] ethan;#0003
they can do testing with 50 players


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Cam#5887
yeah lets make the hotel an app center


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
More guests too


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
More staff opportunities


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
I feel like bigger servers = bigger opportunity


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
well


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean maybe I would be open to 50


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could try reduce lag


[27-Jun-20 12:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
But idk


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
its the same amount of guests and opportunites, just more lag and less servers


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
by like when u tp in the elevator


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk i had an idea of ban request card being transferred to a trello and the roblox server reads the cards, set the ban datastore on roblox, and archives the cards


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] courtney#5125
as long as its not as laggy as boba, im good


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
also more lrs per server üò≠


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
u tp to what u think is above the lobby but no its far away


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
so ur far away with everyone then less lag


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
so that might work but messy


[27-Jun-20 12:34 PM] katie#0200

because the hr doesnt need to come


[27-Jun-20 12:49 PM] Tattoblue#5828

oh yeah whats the point in seniors getting admin if managers have mod


[27-Jun-20 12:53 PM] courtney#5125
so managers are getting mod at training, seniors are just keeping them getting mod?

how people get wrongly fired, suspended, banned, ect... because we dont have an OFFICAL rule document with all the rules in ONE spot. if someone wants to find a rule they need to scroll up through announcements to see if we announced it like 2 years ago

ok so bear added an english only rule in the discord server, i know bear added that on his own accord but we could possibly negotiate to change that because there hasnt been an issue with people speaking other languages, sometimes even i like to speak my second language with other people - **PLUS we never announced it so people could get warned for speaking another language without even knowing there was a change to the rules so maybe we could announce that if we cant remove it**


[27-Jun-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
ya

[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] katie#0200
the problem i see with that is that mrs wont know who to kick if we're still keeping CBs a thing


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] Cam#5887
eh


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] anna#0004
um wait werent we doing that thing where only managers know ab it


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
mrs r still always asking "is this a cb"


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
so like


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] courtney#5125
i mean its nice to have it, since literally everyone just reports whoever has bacon hair and a low account age


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
or is named harriet


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
.


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
.


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
.


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think it‚Äôs something good to have so our mrs have something to look back on


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] anna#0004
maybe we can try that and if it still gets leaked, we just get rid of it as a whole


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] courtney#5125
yeah that girl was innocent bman


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bman#0435
bonnie made a suggestion of a cb channel LOL


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly there's so many CBs it's hard to keep up. When I go to the hotel, I'm confused myself cause I see these people and idek who they are


[27-Jun-20 01:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
did i


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] courtney#5125
someone tried to convince me that "side" is a cb üò≠


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] katie#0200
i mean


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
So it's like I understand why we don't want it, but I also understand how it is useful


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Sizzle has CBs


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I just dont think we should be banning ‚Äúcbs‚Äù because someone could just have a name related to a cb then the staff is like ‚ÄúCB CB CB‚Äù think we should just ban people who go against major rules


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
She's called Pastecookie


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
But like


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
They just ban them


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
If they misbehave


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] courtney#5125
isnt pastecookie a cb here too or no


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Otherwise they can stay


[27-Jun-20 01:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i agree, CBs weren't around until just recently


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] katie#0200
with all of the new CBs, i think going on a shift would be really hectic if we cant kick CBs if they dont do anything because they like to harass staff and just be outright annoying


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm not too sure candy


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
But being a CB is just wasting ur time.. must be sad


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] courtney#5125
i dont even remember anymore


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] bman#0435
theyre people that didnt get what they wanted as lrs


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] bman#0435
idk


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well CB stands for


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
Circumventing Ban


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk i wasnt here


[27-Jun-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
But idk how it actually came so popular


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
not to mention its also unfair to just ban someone for literally having "diego" or "harriet" in their name when theyre clearly not a cb


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] bman#0435
lol fr


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
true but when they‚Äôre account age is so little it‚Äôs sus


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
right not everyone even knows when someone can be classified as a cb


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
if they literally got banned on ONE other account, its not a cb


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] anna#0004
harriet like stopped anyway


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] katie#0200
i wish we could just ip ban the cbs lol


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] courtney#5125
and lrs dont seem to understand taht


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Just get rid of cbs and just ban people if the do bad


[27-Jun-20 01:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
What KJ said ^


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Because i go to hotel and get bombarded


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] bman#0435
we tried that before


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] bman#0435
but it got worse


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] courtney#5125
didnt we get rid of it at some point, but then it was broughtback?


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] bman#0435
and we had to implement cb again


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] katie#0200
yeah thats true


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] anna#0004
most cbs come to major spam anyway so theyre still gonna be bad


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] courtney#5125
ok i have to go !! @impact


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They protested to bring back cbs so they could do more competitions?


[27-Jun-20 01:07 PM] bman#0435
idk i wasnt an hr when it happened but ik it was implemented again after it was removed


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] katie#0200
i dont quite remember since this was like idk a year ago, i remember the CBs just harassing staff and being annoying and making the atmosphere at the hotel unwelcoming for other guests


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well then ban them


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They did sum bad


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] bman#0435
theyd basically do stuff that wouldnt get them banned tho


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let me check staff announcements


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] katie#0200
ya but they can still be there if they dont do anything that can warrant a ban


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] katie#0200
exactly bman


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
I should be able to get the exact time frame


[27-Jun-20 01:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well then dont ban them


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] katie#0200
it was annoying as hell


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] bman#0435
kj ur confusing üò≠


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] katie#0200
trying to deal with other things with CBs following you everywhere and you couldnt do anything since we had no reason to ban


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well if they dont do anything that wouldnt get the ban then dont ban them


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If they do something that gets them banned then ban them


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] bman#0435
theyre only there to annoy everyone and be annoying


[27-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean 99% of the time cbs are there to do something


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] bman#0435
^


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So then ban them


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] bman#0435
literally if we dont ban them they spam


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] katie#0200
exactly theyre doing it on purpose


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If they do sum


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] bman#0435
BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME BAN ME


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] anna#0004
yeah exactly


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok guys


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
I have the timeframe


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
17/06/2019 - we stopped banning for CB

15/11/2019 - we started banning for CB again


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] katie#0200
5 months


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] stacey#1000
Well like they thing is there keeps people being cbs again


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] bman#0435
omg wait it was implemented the day i got shift


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] bman#0435
:O


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] stacey#1000
And maybe with seniors being able to server ban now it will help


[27-Jun-20 01:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Because mia is a cb but there could be another person who has mia and then staff like ‚Äúget out of her mia the cb‚Äù


[27-Jun-20 01:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And the players like whooo what where


[27-Jun-20 01:11 PM] stacey#1000
So like can we try removing it again to see how it goes with seniors server banning?


[27-Jun-20 01:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think we should trial remove banning for CB again


[27-Jun-20 01:11 PM] stacey#1000
Also I have to be on mute now sorry


[27-Jun-20 01:11 PM] bman#0435
@KjRBLX whos mia


[27-Jun-20 01:11 PM] stacey#1000
If people major spam they get banned


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] anna#0004
stop banning them


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] stacey#1000
Can we remove it to see how it goes?


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] bman#0435
i wanna keep the rule


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But then i wont remember who a cb is


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] bman#0435
well then how will we know who the cbs r


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] stacey#1000
Because really it‚Äôs hard to keep up who‚Äôs a cb or not


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] bman#0435
ye lemme get it


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] stacey#1000
People asked me today to add 5 new names to the list


[27-Jun-20 01:12 PM] stacey#1000
There is way too many I really don‚Äôt like the cb rule

[27-Jun-20 01:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LOL who added the PEPPA pig fairy emoji


[27-Jun-20 01:13 PM] stacey#1000
And MRs will not know who is a cb


[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] katie#0200
then MRs will be like "is this a cb is this a cb"


[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yep


[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] katie#0200

[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] stacey#1000
Yes they have their own too


[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] katie#0200

[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If i go to hotel with a cb name


[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im prob gonna get reported


[27-Jun-20 01:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
loll


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
Do you guys think it would be possible to see how it goes with seniors server banning


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] katie#0200
ok


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] katie#0200
tat toe


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] katie#0200
idk


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] katie#0200
lol


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Tat to


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i was gonna talk about the rule doc but ethan brung it up.. but uhhh


[27-Jun-20 01:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
sometimes it takes a while for us to deal with MRs


[27-Jun-20 01:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we'll bring it up and then someone'll ping about it a few days later


[27-Jun-20 01:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
but we do have to investigate so


[27-Jun-20 01:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
nvm


[27-Jun-20 01:17 PM] Cam#5887
yeah i see what you are saying tatto


[27-Jun-20 01:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Tell bear to give us a remote ban system with the new admin hes making so we dont have to use his private server just to fill reports


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Just if its possible


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Nope, all good


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
me


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
1000 dollar website!!


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] anna#0004
me


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Scam


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] katie#0200
i think i have one more thing


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] Cam#5887
ill brb super quickly sorry guys


[27-Jun-20 01:18 PM] anna#0004
oh no i do not


[27-Jun-20 01:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk ill see if i can find a better place than trello


[27-Jun-20 01:19 PM] katie#0200
this is a suggestion, but i know that fizze logs the times MRs join and leave their cafe, if we do that it would be a way for us to track heads hotel activity more easily since managers log shifts on the management board


[27-Jun-20 01:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh i thought


[27-Jun-20 01:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
of something @impact


[27-Jun-20 01:20 PM] Polk#1596
he's playing cookie clicker


[27-Jun-20 01:20 PM] katie#0200
lol


[27-Jun-20 01:20 PM] stacey#1000
I like that idea. Managers and seniors log hotel activity so heads could in the discord possibly


[27-Jun-20 01:21 PM] katie#0200
yeah in a separate hr only channel


[27-Jun-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
Yes like they have inactive notices there now as well


[27-Jun-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs a good idea


[27-Jun-20 01:21 PM] Cam#5887
can i add on super quickly?


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] katie#0200
that would be leaked so much


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] anna#0004
uhhhhhhhhh


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like trello board?


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure what would be in it really


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
#leaked


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
x200


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs only inactive notices and hotel logging it could work


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if it‚Äôs just like inactivity stuff, logging@


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
One at a time please


[27-Jun-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
Like that‚Äôs not too much for it to be leaked


[27-Jun-20 01:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah


[27-Jun-20 01:23 PM] katie#0200
ohh yes


[27-Jun-20 01:23 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs a good idea


[27-Jun-20 01:23 PM] katie#0200
preach cam


[27-Jun-20 01:24 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs not like people getting banned it‚Äôs not bad


[27-Jun-20 01:24 PM] katie#0200
that doesnt sound too bad


[27-Jun-20 01:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that‚Äôs true


[27-Jun-20 01:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Cam it'd be good to implement


[27-Jun-20 01:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah cause that would definitely get leaked

:bloxton3: **NOTICE OF SUSPENSION** :bloxton3: 

Greetings, MegaMxtch.

The HR team has received information regarding a situation which is talking about a current Middle Rank's suspension reason. With this information received, you will be suspended for **3 days** from your position as 9 | Head of Services.

The HR team would also like to let you know that telling other users about an MR suspension is unacceptable. We have deemed necessary to put the suspension in place immediately, starting June 27, 2020 at 2:24 PM. Please reply to this message accordingly if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
**cam_s**
**Shift Manager**
**Bloxton Hotels**

when the :h command is used at the same time as someone else, what do i do:
``-Queue system, first message first, then second appears after first fades``
``-Replace first message with second message``


[27-Jun-20 03:17 PM] Polk#1596
i'd say the first one


[27-Jun-20 03:17 PM] Polk#1596

[27-Jun-20 03:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh yeah I was about to say, does ‚Äú5m‚Äù mean we have 5 minutes


[27-Jun-20 03:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
to see it before it goes away


[27-Jun-20 03:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Or is long messages gonna fit on that one line?


[27-Jun-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435

[27-Jun-20 03:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
they will be staying there


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
the 5m is an indicator slot


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
it means its been 5 minutes since that message was received


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
it counts upward


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ohhhh


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
when you first get it it starts counting up in seconds


[27-Jun-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760

[27-Jun-20 03:31 PM] Beartikal#9760

[27-Jun-20 04:15 PM] Polk#1596
but basically


[27-Jun-20 04:15 PM] Polk#1596
if i were to kick a troller at the hotel


[27-Jun-20 04:15 PM] Polk#1596
lets say a receptionist with the name BloxtonWorker is there


[27-Jun-20 04:15 PM] Polk#1596
and the troller is named


[27-Jun-20 04:16 PM] Polk#1596
BloxtonWorke


[27-Jun-20 04:16 PM] Polk#1596
then it would kick the staff as well


[27-Jun-20 04:16 PM] Polk#1596
is it possible if u could do something to prevent that in the new admin? @Beartikal


[27-Jun-20 04:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
theres command confirmation


[27-Jun-20 04:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
it will tell you to make sure you didn't do it by mistake


[27-Jun-20 04:34 PM] Beartikal#9760

[27-Jun-20 06:54 PM] bman#0435

it was a GC I was added to


[27-Jun-20 06:55 PM] courtney#5125
i still dk why she ever said that, but she apologized so many times for it


[27-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
this is what emma said in june of 2019. ik it was a year ago but i mean it still counts


[27-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
"And Mad1ee accidentally sending out a document that she thought was meant to be public knowledge is a bit different then leaking MR announcements after we've specifically told people not to leak anything without permission?"


[27-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
basically, she leaked the cb doc


[27-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
got suspended


[27-Jun-20 06:55 PM] bman#0435
then leaked more


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] courtney#5125
she leaked more after that.....?


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
so shes done a LOT of terrible things over just trash talking


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
@RAMMGaming first thing I see in the chat is the photo you sent what is that omg-


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] bman#0435
i assume so, reading what emma stated


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] courtney#5125
i only thought she leaked the cb list on accident, she thought it was public information


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] courtney#5125
ofc idk tho i wasnt an hr at the time!


[27-Jun-20 06:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
it was a GC call I was randomly added to


[27-Jun-20 06:57 PM] bman#0435
like yes she was mainly blacklisted for trash talking, but she also did more than just that


[27-Jun-20 06:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@Cam what‚Äôs up with that dude in questions

[27-Jun-20 07:25 PM] bman#0435
Greetings Management & Seniors! 

The CB document has been renewed and reinstated to now only be in the hands of Management+ from now on. We believe having the doc around for Management+ would be beneficial when reviewing reports and checking to see if someone is actually a CB. This document will **not** be released to Heads, as we have experienced a growth in leaking of the document. Please make sure you keep this document for Management+ eyes. Like before, this document will be renewed every month or so and merely after every resignation. Please remember that you may tell others if someone is a CB but may not hand out the document itself.

@Cam @stacey I think the extension should be revoked, check the timestamps for when he was suspended and when he sent the message that made you think he was complaining about his suspension


[27-Jun-20 09:11 PM] katie#0200
he said that 20 mins before he got suspended

[27-Jun-20 09:39 PM] Cam#5887
3:04, my thing is, why would he say that before a suspension?


[27-Jun-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
Jessie reported it to me after he was suspended


[27-Jun-20 09:39 PM] Cam#5887
This is interesting case


[27-Jun-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
she said he was blaming someone for leaking the chat


[27-Jun-20 09:40 PM] Cam#5887
cause of the times


[27-Jun-20 09:40 PM] bman#0435
so jessie is tryna get revenge on mitch pretty much üëÅüëÑüëÅ


[27-Jun-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
so either way it should make the suspension longer even if it was before or not  because he is acknowledging  that he shouldnt have done it and is acting immature when its told to someone to get reported

he complained about the user that reported him


[27-Jun-20 09:42 PM] bman#0435
oh


[27-Jun-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
Jessie is not getting revenge because mitch had no business telling people about her suspension and she reported it to me because it made her feel really bad


[27-Jun-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
so, his suspension stands for 5 days still :))


[27-Jun-20 09:42 PM] bman#0435
ye i was wondering if jessie was trying to report things from before the suspension to get it extended as a form of revenge for getting her suspended


[27-Jun-20 09:42 PM] bman#0435
btw stacey, she didnt even ask me about it

[27-Jun-20 09:43 PM] bman#0435
either way, none of those chatlogs seemed to be her angling towards a photo


[27-Jun-20 09:44 PM] bman#0435
and she threatened to make the doc


[27-Jun-20 09:44 PM] stacey#1000
both of their suspensions will remain either way


[27-Jun-20 09:44 PM] bman#0435
ye


[27-Jun-20 09:44 PM] bman#0435
not sure y she tryna get another mr involved now tho


[27-Jun-20 09:44 PM] katie#0200
shouldn‚Äôt we revoke mitch‚Äôs extension tho? since the reason it was extended in the first place is kinda invalid now


[27-Jun-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000
I mean he still complained people told others and if I knew that before i wouldve said 5 days instead of 3


[27-Jun-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000
meaning he knew it was wrong and still did it


[27-Jun-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000
"i told you not to tell anyone"


[27-Jun-20 09:45 PM] bman#0435
ye he was immature abt gettinf reported


[27-Jun-20 09:45 PM] stacey#1000
like he clearly knew it was wrong and then he goes and complains about it


[27-Jun-20 09:46 PM] katie#0200
He didn‚Äôt know he got reported at the time, I showed screenshots of him explaining it and he said it was between him and jenna because obviously he wasn‚Äôt expecting his friend to tell anyone, he also told me he knows what he did was wrong but at the time he didn‚Äôt know he was breaking any rules


[27-Jun-20 09:47 PM] courtney#5125

then she proceeded to ask if i could make mitch unblock her-


[27-Jun-20 09:47 PM] stacey#1000
because either way he still gets a suspension


[27-Jun-20 09:48 PM] katie#0200

ya mitch was telling ppl why she was suspended and showing ppl it


[28-Jun-20 04:24 PM] bman#0435
all allinqa did was say it shouldve been a demotion


[28-Jun-20 04:24 PM] courtney#5125
yeahhhh


[28-Jun-20 04:24 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Jun-20 04:24 PM] xM_inn#2821

Greetings, Allinqa.

This is a formal warning to remind you to be respectful to people at all times. Bloxton Hotels has standards for our MRs and due to your actions, we feel it necessary to remind you to be respectful to everyone at all times. This warning is issued on 06/28/20 at 5:30 PM EST. If you have any questions regarding this, please feel free to ask me. Thank you.

Basic admin has 4 admin levels, to allow seniors to ban that means heads and managers will have to be able to ban as well


[28-Jun-20 06:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
@High Rank


[28-Jun-20 06:36 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[28-Jun-20 06:37 PM] Cam#5887

[28-Jun-20 06:37 PM] bman#0435

[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] Cam#5887
it was an error


[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] Beartikal#9760

[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435

[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
i meant like the CBs main accounts


[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
arent banned xd


[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
What if we just wait until the custom admin panel is finished instead, and if it's possible, Bear could make seniors their own admin level


[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435
they should be lol


[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] bman#0435
they should be blacklisted


[28-Jun-20 06:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah my admin u can create as many levels as u want


[28-Jun-20 06:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
I say we wait then


[28-Jun-20 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
U could put shift managers up to superadmin


[28-Jun-20 06:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Shift managers should get superadmin so we can do banning sessions with seniors


[28-Jun-20 06:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
As there's no major hurry atm


[28-Jun-20 06:39 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yes


[28-Jun-20 06:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
everytime i go in a hotel group or cafe game


[28-Jun-20 06:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
the owner or developer or whatever would log on and ask me to friend them


[28-Jun-20 06:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
i never accept friend requests from group people as they are usually always involved in bad business or are shady

[28-Jun-20 06:59 PM] Beartikal#9760

[28-Jun-20 06:59 PM] Beartikal#9760

[28-Jun-20 06:59 PM] babymariobebe#7563
We dont really ally with anyone anymore


[28-Jun-20 06:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
there‚Äôs no good groups anymore


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I do wanna check out that new sushi place tho


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly the only benefit allies have with us is being able to collaborate events with them


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
or decent ones you could say


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563
they closed it for V2 but I never got to play but the ads looked cool


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
But there's no significant gain to us, we're only necessarily gaining them


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah we just use them for social aspects and events


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
we are the largest group


[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] xM_inn#2821

[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] xM_inn#2821

[28-Jun-20 07:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[28-Jun-20 07:01 PM] Beartikal#9760

[28-Jun-20 07:02 PM] xM_inn#2821

@anna hey you know the few sessions you cohosted, did you put cards on the training board for them (such as anna and candy | training | whenever)


[29-Jun-20 05:54 AM] bonnie591#0591

[29-Jun-20 05:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
2 sessions added to ur total cuz u forgot to add them @Polk


[29-Jun-20 05:57 AM] anna#0004
@bonnie591 ya and one of them was from when stacey co hosted ints with me then the other was with candy and the other 2 were katie and tattos secondary servers


[29-Jun-20 05:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok when you host someones second server you can count that as session hosted and if ur cohosting you dont need to put both of ur names in card, just the main host cuz it confuses me when i count them @anna


[29-Jun-20 05:59 AM] anna#0004
Oh I just went based off this info: "If you help another HR with another server in their session, we call this COHOSTING, and this receives the same credit."

[29-Jun-20 11:44 AM] bman#0435
Hi again, Bman! So, recently, there was a server with around 9 MRs who decided NOT to server hop, and also to take a photo with all of the LRs that were present in the server. By doing this, the server was left with no staff.

From what I remember, there were announcements in SA about the limit of MRs per server, as well as that you shouldn‚Äôt take shift photos with more than 2-3 LRs. I just thought I‚Äôd bring this to your attention, thanks!!

we need to make an announcement about the using morphs


[29-Jun-20 10:20 PM] ethan;#0003
so people dont report that anymore


[29-Jun-20 10:20 PM] ethan;#0003
and also the abuse of housekeeping tools


[29-Jun-20 10:20 PM] ethan;#0003
how that shouldnt be reported either


[29-Jun-20 10:26 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal bear can i write up an announcement about this?


[29-Jun-20 10:26 PM] ethan;#0003
and also do you still want spinning on a segway considered abuse


[29-Jun-20 10:26 PM] ethan;#0003
and when people jump with someone cuffed


[29-Jun-20 10:26 PM] ethan;#0003
people report all that stuff


[29-Jun-20 10:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
not abuse but frowned upon


[29-Jun-20 10:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
they should just hold them and wait for an MR


[29-Jun-20 10:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
not toy with them


[29-Jun-20 10:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
jumping with someone cuffed is not really abuse


[29-Jun-20 10:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
what is abuse is cuffing a random person


[29-Jun-20 10:30 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal people usualy jump with someone in cuffs is when they are walking because people jump without even noticing they jump because its just a habbit


[29-Jun-20 10:30 PM] ethan;#0003
and also


[29-Jun-20 10:30 PM] ethan;#0003
what about the segways


[29-Jun-20 10:30 PM] ethan;#0003
people get reported for spinning on it


[29-Jun-20 10:36 PM] ethan;#0003

Greetings Bloxton Hotel staff. 

Today, I am announcing some rule changes that have been implemented.

- Staff are NOW ALLOWED to use morphs while working.
- Secondly, you are NO LONGER allowed to report staff for ‚Äùabuse of tools‚Äù for the following tools: Spray Bottle, Trolley, and Vacuum. 
- In addition, jumping while having someone cuffed is NO LONGER reportable as it is a players first instinct to jump while walking, especially when it is uncontrollable on mobile devices.
- Lastly, staff are NO LONGER able to report a player for spinning on a segway. 

To sum up, all staff are allowed to use the Spray Bottle, Trolley, and Vacuum whenever and wherever within the hotel as they wish. If you are caught reporting for these reasons, the report will be declined. If you see someone reporting for one of the reasons stated above, please remind them and update them about the rule change. Thank you, and if you have any questions about these changes, don't hesitate to contact an HR!

You should make an announcement to MRs and managers as well. Tell all MRs to update their training guides and inform managers not to accept reports like that.


[29-Jun-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
They gotta be made aware too.


[29-Jun-20 10:41 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; fixed it up a bit


[29-Jun-20 10:41 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Jun-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
Make one for MRs now


[29-Jun-20 10:42 PM] ethan;#0003
I will announce this first


[29-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[29-Jun-20 10:44 PM] ethan;#0003
i will tag the mr role in staff announcements telling them to update the guids to fit the new rules stated in announcements


[29-Jun-20 11:02 PM] bman#0435
people r asking me to put an X reaction to the announcement as their form of disagreement. can i do so?


[29-Jun-20 11:03 PM] ethan;#0003
no


[29-Jun-20 11:03 PM] ethan;#0003
can someone help me answer all the questions


[29-Jun-20 11:03 PM] bman#0435
y not, its better than them flat out saying it in gd and getting banned for saying what they want


[29-Jun-20 11:04 PM] ethan;#0003
nobody will get banned for stating opinions

ryan said not to ban for that anymore


[29-Jun-20 11:05 PM] bman#0435
alright well gd is practically begging for an X reaction. its not a disagreement or going against u, its just what they think of the announcement


[29-Jun-20 11:05 PM] ethan;#0003
people are complaining about letting staff use morphs...


[29-Jun-20 11:05 PM] ethan;#0003
people complained when we stopped letting them use morphs....


[29-Jun-20 11:05 PM] bman#0435
theyre complaining about it all


[29-Jun-20 11:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
no X please


[29-Jun-20 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact can you use your ways to calm down general


[29-Jun-20 11:06 PM] bman#0435
i dont see y an X reaction could be so bad


[29-Jun-20 11:07 PM] impact#0297
Why didn‚Äôt I have any consultation in these announcements


[29-Jun-20 11:07 PM] bman#0435

[29-Jun-20 11:07 PM] bman#0435
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[29-Jun-20 11:07 PM] bman#0435

[29-Jun-20 11:07 PM] ethan;#0003
we agreed abut this like a week ago


[29-Jun-20 11:07 PM] ethan;#0003
and i asked and people gave their opinions


[29-Jun-20 11:08 PM] ethan;#0003
and got permission to announce


[29-Jun-20 11:12 PM] impact#0297
ok going forward


[29-Jun-20 11:13 PM] impact#0297
all announcements that affect rule changes or go into #announcements need to be approved by either me or 2 boards or a chairman


[29-Jun-20 11:13 PM] impact#0297
or like me and boards


[29-Jun-20 11:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
:checkmark:


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@ethan; Let us (cyto, bear, and I) know when making major rule changes next time


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] bman#0435
we cant send stuff in there üòî


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] ethan;#0003
I asked bear


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] ethan;#0003
He said okay


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I'm not so sure about the morphs but I love the other rules


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
true


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I mean they are really good rules, more lax


[29-Jun-20 11:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I like that


[29-Jun-20 11:15 PM] impact#0297
I love the announcement too but we need to prepare communications/key messaging for negative comments


[29-Jun-20 11:15 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Agree cyto


[29-Jun-20 11:16 PM] stacey#1000
I remember why we removed morphs in the first place


[29-Jun-20 11:16 PM] impact#0297
cause now we have stuff like this

lol


[29-Jun-20 11:16 PM] ethan;#0003
People complained when we impimented the rules now they complain when we remove them


[29-Jun-20 11:16 PM] stacey#1000
It was because people found it unprofessional pretty much to say a toddler is working as a security, or like when reception or bar use the smallest morph you cannot even see them over the counter.


[29-Jun-20 11:16 PM] stacey#1000
People are upset with the morphs being allowed.


[29-Jun-20 11:17 PM] stacey#1000
That's what I've heard the most complaints about,


[29-Jun-20 11:17 PM] stacey#1000
They are happy about Housekeeping tools pretty much.


[29-Jun-20 11:17 PM] bman#0435
theyre happy about that because they get to spray anyone and everyone


[29-Jun-20 11:17 PM] bman#0435
lol


[29-Jun-20 11:17 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah.


[29-Jun-20 11:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@ethan; We can't please everybody anymore


[29-Jun-20 11:19 PM] babymariobebe#7563
We have 1M members and even with updates I do (like the highly requested new uniforms) we get mixed reviews


[29-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
Honestly of all the rules the only one that people really are complaining about is the morph rule.


[29-Jun-20 11:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
Everything else is amazing.


[29-Jun-20 11:19 PM] ethan;#0003
I understand. I am sorry for not getting enough feedback from bod+ before announcing .


[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah thats what im saying about morphs people dont like it because of the reasons I said above


[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
@KjRBLX Ik you mentioned about Lee being disrespectful to you during your game of arsenal yesterday, well this happened today during my game of envtops with him. It's nothing too serious but I thought I'd bring it up since you mentioned you've been having trouble with him.

[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah it is kinda hard to see behind counter I agree


[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
I personally dont like they should be allowed to use the smallest morph


[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] bman#0435
you little crap


[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
It's not your fault I gave you approval, however, we should relay major changes to Strategic Advisors / BODs as well.


[29-Jun-20 11:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
The rule is great, though.


[29-Jun-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
what about shifts and generals


[29-Jun-20 11:21 PM] stacey#1000
Can we remove the morph rule being allowed again and make it not allowed?


[29-Jun-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
does that mean we dont need to state opinions for BODs+ to just approve it


[29-Jun-20 11:21 PM] ethan;#0003
Maybe we say that staff can not use the morphs while standing behind the counter as it makes it difficult for players to see them.


[29-Jun-20 11:21 PM] ethan;#0003
But they are allowed to use the morphs anywhere else in the hotel.


[29-Jun-20 11:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
alright how about this


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
**edits to rule**
securities cannot use morphs at all as their handcuffs dont work with it
other roles may use morphs if not behind the counter.


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
?


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
what do you guys think?


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
that way they can agree with all the other rules


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] ethan;#0003
that will please most of the complains


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
yea


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
and i can see the concern for them


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] bman#0435
whats the point in other roles being able to use morphs but not behind counters when theyre all at counters


[29-Jun-20 11:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they arent at counter


[29-Jun-20 11:24 PM] bman#0435
but they all work at counters...


[29-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
(breaks update)


[29-Jun-20 11:24 PM] bman#0435
when is that update coming out


[29-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
after this upcoming update


[29-Jun-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
we got an update brewing


[29-Jun-20 11:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
what doez the update entail


[29-Jun-20 11:25 PM] bman#0435
so basically rn no one can use morphs...


[29-Jun-20 11:25 PM] bman#0435
lol


[29-Jun-20 11:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
isnt that what you wanted


[29-Jun-20 11:27 PM] bman#0435
yes but thats not what was announced


[29-Jun-20 11:27 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal can I update the announcement to what you said above?


[29-Jun-20 11:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
i guess so yeah
every other rule should have no complainers


[29-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
so we should be clear after the correction


[29-Jun-20 11:28 PM] ethan;#0003
alright


[29-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
maybe we changed too quickly or something


[29-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
we'll just stick to the other rules for now


[29-Jun-20 11:29 PM] ethan;#0003
- Staff are **NOW ALLOWED** to use morphs while working to a limit, security are **NOT ALLOWED** to use morphs as cuffs do not work properly while using morphs. In addition, staff are **NOT ALLOWED** to use morphs while STANDING behind a counter as it makes it difficult for players to see the.


[29-Jun-20 11:29 PM] ethan;#0003
it will be changed to this


[29-Jun-20 11:29 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal this good?


[29-Jun-20 11:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
yes
--changes:


[29-Jun-20 11:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
working to a limit


[29-Jun-20 11:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
to


[29-Jun-20 11:31 PM] Beartikal#9760
working *under certain conditions*
--


[29-Jun-20 11:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
@ethan;


[29-Jun-20 11:36 PM] ethan;#0003
I updated to what you said


[29-Jun-20 11:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
also they CAN use tools by the way and they CAN report when INTENDING to spray in the face. I just dont want them reporting for "Accidents" or for "Innapropriate role using Tools"


[29-Jun-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
if they flat out troll, they CAN be reported.


[29-Jun-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
you need to be more clear


[29-Jun-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
they can be used as intended by ALL ranks


[29-Jun-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just dont want trolling or "spray on face" on purpose


[29-Jun-20 11:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
but they cant report if its a "mistake" or "innapropriate rank"


[29-Jun-20 11:37 PM] ethan;#0003
So basicly, if they are purposly using the tools to annoy other players then they can be reported.


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
of course


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
it sounds bad rn


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] ethan;#0003
alright


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
the whole point was that


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] ethan;#0003
ill update  it


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
so we dont get reports for "minor" or "accidents"


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
see


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
i did approve it, but i dont think i read it enough


[29-Jun-20 11:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
let's run it through others as well


[29-Jun-20 11:39 PM] Beartikal#9760
i kinda mistake a bit


[29-Jun-20 11:39 PM] ethan;#0003
**The ONLY** way you are allowed to report a player for one of these reasons  is if they are using the tools to annoy and or disrespect guests/staff.


[29-Jun-20 11:39 PM] ethan;#0003
this is what will be added


[29-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
**CLARIFICATION ON RULES:**
-Morphs cannot be used behind counter by any staff
-Morphs cannot be used by Security at all while on-duty or cuffing
-Tool Trolling CAN be reported if flat-out abusing, we wanted to add this rule so that "mistakes" or "mis-clicks" aren't reported. You also CANNOT report for "wrong rank using tools".


[29-Jun-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
------
so that basically ^^


[29-Jun-20 11:43 PM] ethan;#0003
Should I edit the message or send that separately.


[29-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
we made it seem "too-leaniant"


[29-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
edit and also send separate


[29-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
so they rlly see it


[29-Jun-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
then probs ping all again that we weren't clear enough


[29-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
after that they should stop complaining


[29-Jun-20 11:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
since we addressed like all their concenrs


[29-Jun-20 11:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
Does anyone know if thvomas (tomo) ever had their former MR role removed?


[29-Jun-20 11:45 PM] bman#0435

A lot of people are showing their true colours in general rn.. i don't see why they're starting so much drama over it


[29-Jun-20 11:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
They should peacefully address their concerns to us in DMs or create a ticket or something instead


[29-Jun-20 11:54 PM] bman#0435
its just something they dont agree with. if we wanted to peacefully address it, we shouldve added an X reaction


[29-Jun-20 11:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
That wouldn't change anything


[29-Jun-20 11:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
That's giving them what they want


[29-Jun-20 11:56 PM] bman#0435
arent we supposed to satisfy the public too...?


[29-Jun-20 11:56 PM] ethan;#0003
there is no way to satisfy everyone


[29-Jun-20 11:56 PM] ethan;#0003
and we need to come to that understanding


[29-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
are people still complaining


[29-Jun-20 11:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what are people mad about, is it the morphs?

9pm est is 2am for bonnie and 3am for polk, so they'll likely be sleeping (i'll be awake cause... duh i'm min!) so i'd say maybe 7-8 pm est if possible but 9pm works otherwise


[30-Jun-20 01:02 AM] stacey#1000

@Beartikal ^^


[30-Jun-20 11:06 AM] stacey#1000
Just asking because she was banned by one of you and she is looking to appeal but there is no ban reason. Is this someone we are allowed to unban?


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] bman#0435
@anna did lyoo give him perms


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
@anna so it wasn‚Äôt tik tok video or anything right


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] anna#0004
No ill show the proof of their dms


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
Cause if it was a YouTube video or tik tok they can send it


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] bman#0435
nah stacey he said "credits to lyoo"


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
Oh


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] anna#0004
doesn't look like a tik tok video


[30-Jun-20 11:21 AM] bman#0435
look under his username


[30-Jun-20 11:22 AM] bman#0435
first sentence


[30-Jun-20 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
Ok well I would say a warning tbh if it was just a video from it. We‚Äôve never fired people for sending photos that were sent in staff lounge because it doesn‚Äôt really show the content. It is just a video so firing is def too strict


[30-Jun-20 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
@anna add a vote for warning, suspension, or termination


[30-Jun-20 11:23 AM] anna#0004
Will do


[30-Jun-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
@anna you got 5 votes all good to warn him


[30-Jun-20 11:26 AM] anna#0004
Alright, just going to the hotel rq then I'll do it!

[30-Jun-20 12:44 PM] katie#0200
after a while madi asked for proof of her being unprofessional at trainings so i sent some to her and this was her response, ik this is kinda old but apparently you warned her on the 6th of december for failing to comply with PMs, and shes saying she only got a formal warning from mack when she actually has had 3 in total

[30-Jun-20 03:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@stacey @bman No, she was banned for disrespecting the group and just straight up hating. She may not appeal. I already dealt with her with bloo.


[30-Jun-20 03:01 PM] babymariobebe#7563
These aren't the kind of people I want in our discord


[30-Jun-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
Oki ty for clarifying  just wasn‚Äôt sure cause there was no ban reason listed on the discord


[30-Jun-20 03:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
hey does anybody know how we can mute in our discord


[30-Jun-20 03:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
because if thats not a feature its kinda needed


[30-Jun-20 03:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
we can use that instead of just banning or kicking or warning
i see it a a line between a warning and kicking


[30-Jun-20 03:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
?


[30-Jun-20 03:42 PM] ethan;#0003
You take away their roles


[30-Jun-20 03:42 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal


[30-Jun-20 03:47 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I think there‚Äôs a mute command with dyno. But that requires a ‚Äúmuted‚Äù role to be added to the server @Beartikal


[30-Jun-20 03:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
which


[30-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
what a pain


[30-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Or we can just take away talkative like Ethan said but we‚Äôd have to log whose roles we took


[30-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Tattoblue#5828
And when to give it back


[30-Jun-20 03:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill find a bot that does itfor us


[30-Jun-20 03:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
i found one that removes all roles on mute and gives them all back after the mute


[30-Jun-20 03:49 PM] Beartikal#9760
that sounds like it would work


[30-Jun-20 04:05 PM] katie#0200
@stacey i think im gonna promote pip in ur session


[30-Jun-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000

[30-Jun-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
rip


[30-Jun-20 04:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Saab sent that to me.
I personally wouldn't ban them because it could of been a mistake.
But would I still have to do rule 2?

@High Rank do you guys care if we ban or allow morphs at the hotel


[30-Jun-20 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
For staff?


[30-Jun-20 05:54 PM] impact#0297
yes


[30-Jun-20 05:54 PM] bman#0435
i kinda do. u cant even look over the desks as the toddler morph lol


[30-Jun-20 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
I dont think staff should be allowed to use it still because like if a reception or bar use it they cant see over the counter and a lot of people have complained about it


[30-Jun-20 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'd say ban cuz yes what bman said


[30-Jun-20 05:54 PM] bman#0435
also the public wouldnt like it much if we allowed it


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
and also a security trying to cuff people as a toddler morph no thanks


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] impact#0297
@anna @ethan; @Polk ur opinions too


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
we removed it being allowed for a reason


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] anna#0004
Ya I don't think they should be allowed to use morphs


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] anna#0004
And especially not security anyway


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] ethan;#0003
They shouldn't be allowed to use it while working at the counters or while cuffing someone.


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] courtney#5125
same here, it shouldn't be allowed


[30-Jun-20 05:55 PM] courtney#5125
well they're almost always behind counters or cuffing someone


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
ok so now


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
if you catch someone morphing


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
what would you do


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
suspend?


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
warn?


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003
Suspend


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] courtney#5125
suspending seems too harsh, in my opinion


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] anna#0004
eehhh i was thinking more of warn but


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] courtney#5125
i'd say warn


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
I agree with banning morphs for staff


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
I say warn too


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003
warn


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] bman#0435
we warned in the past for it


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] bman#0435
lol


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] bman#0435
i dont see y we would change it now


[30-Jun-20 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003
I mean we currently suspend


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] ethan;#0003
but it should be warning


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] impact#0297
"You will initially be warned, but repeated violations will result in a suspension."


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] impact#0297
How does that sound


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] anna#0004
ya


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
Good


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] impact#0297
cool folks.. stay close to this chat, might have some more questions for ya


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] anna#0004
üëç


[30-Jun-20 05:57 PM] impact#0297
we are krafting an amazing announcement rn


[30-Jun-20 05:59 PM] courtney#5125
so will it be a warning if ur just in the morph or will it be a warning if ur in it AND refuse to change into the correct morph?


[30-Jun-20 06:00 PM] impact#0297
well


[30-Jun-20 06:00 PM] impact#0297
you have to warn them to change it in the first place


[30-Jun-20 06:00 PM] impact#0297
use your discretion


[30-Jun-20 06:01 PM] ethan;#0003
We announced a while ago that people need to tell them to take it off or stop using it before they report it. Nobody followed it.


[30-Jun-20 06:01 PM] courtney#5125
bc i dont think ppl should be warned if the only evidence there is is just someone being in the toddler morph


[30-Jun-20 06:01 PM] courtney#5125
theyre not allowed to use it, correct. however, there are still people that might not know they cant use it, they might think its something for everyone :/


[30-Jun-20 06:02 PM] anna#0004
ya not everyone has discord to know


[30-Jun-20 06:02 PM] Polk#1596
yes i agree


[30-Jun-20 06:02 PM] Polk#1596
with everyone else


[30-Jun-20 06:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

nobody said no


[30-Jun-20 06:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ya


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So why are we talking about keeping it


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] bman#0435
y would the format change the rule lol


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
If 9 people said remove it


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming they cant even look over the desks with some morphs


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming there was a lot of backlash


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Backlash?


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
From staff?


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL WHAT


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WHY


[30-Jun-20 06:07 PM] ethan;#0003
they said it was unprofessional


[30-Jun-20 06:08 PM] ethan;#0003
so they tried to riot in the discord


[30-Jun-20 06:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
LOL


[30-Jun-20 06:08 PM] bman#0435
they cant even look over desks with morphs


[30-Jun-20 06:11 PM] impact#0297
it wasn't really staff


[30-Jun-20 06:11 PM] impact#0297
more former MR's


[30-Jun-20 06:11 PM] impact#0297
minn pointed that out yesterday


[30-Jun-20 06:11 PM] impact#0297

[30-Jun-20 06:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
What


[30-Jun-20 06:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Why can‚Äôt people be reported for jumping with cuffs


[30-Jun-20 06:13 PM] anna#0004
seems good


[30-Jun-20 06:13 PM] bman#0435

[30-Jun-20 06:13 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Jun-20 06:14 PM] ethan;#0003
^^


[30-Jun-20 06:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Hm that‚Äôs interesting


[30-Jun-20 06:14 PM] impact#0297
Because mobile users literally get fucked downwards and backwards for moving around with someone cuffed.. looks like they stubbed their toe on a door


[30-Jun-20 06:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Never play on mobile so didn‚Äôt know that was a thing


[30-Jun-20 06:14 PM] stacey#1000
thats good


[30-Jun-20 06:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Works for me


[30-Jun-20 06:15 PM] ethan;#0003
And that bug when they would fly in the air doesnt happen anymore, that is why we implemented that rule.


[30-Jun-20 06:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
mobile players (iPad) staff jump auto when near a jump able part that's the main reason


[30-Jun-20 06:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
cuz u know flase repprts


[30-Jun-20 06:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
false


[30-Jun-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Honestly you don‚Äôt need the thing on the bottom


[30-Jun-20 06:16 PM] bman#0435
ye it wasnt even a typo lol


[30-Jun-20 06:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@impact personally don‚Äôt think you need the thing on the bottom, a lot of people already forgot about it lol


[30-Jun-20 06:17 PM] impact#0297
uhhh not really


[30-Jun-20 06:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[30-Jun-20 06:24 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Jun-20 06:24 PM] impact#0297

[30-Jun-20 06:33 PM] impact#0297
Mention it.


[30-Jun-20 06:33 PM] impact#0297
Excessive spinning around guests and employees is not allowed


[30-Jun-20 06:33 PM] impact#0297
But I don't give a rats ass if an employee is spinning his mind out behind the hotel

here's a question for you all: Are staff still allowed to use morphs in PRIVATE servers?


[30-Jun-20 06:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes they should be able to

[30-Jun-20 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
why do we still have the ban-logging channel for seniors like what do they post there for now and why. I thought that channel was for the one time they got admin at the hotel to ban people and they posted it there. Are they using that channel for ban requests now or what?


[30-Jun-20 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn


[30-Jun-20 10:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
No that was a one-time thing we used like months ago


[30-Jun-20 10:40 PM] bman#0435
well arent they getting banning perms soon


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
Remember when seniors were temp given admin during the raids or something


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
yea


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
soon


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
we can delete that channel now honestly, last time we used it i think was like march/april


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
many months ago


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] bman#0435
no


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] bman#0435
like last week


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821

[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
yeah we used it for that but like maddy still posts stuff in it-


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] bman#0435
bonnie gave admin to a few for some reason


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
Like what are they using it for now


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh


[30-Jun-20 10:41 PM] xM_inn#2821
idk why it was used last week


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
it was supposed to be a one-time only thing


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] bman#0435
idk either


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
Can we delete the channel


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
It confuses me


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
mhm, get perms from baby/bear first tho


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] stacey#1000
I thought it was suppose to be deleted a long time ago


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] bman#0435
ye i agree with stacey


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause i think u need perms from them


[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] bman#0435

[30-Jun-20 10:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
