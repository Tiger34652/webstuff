@Bloo_Berriez @bonnie591 @Polk @xM_inn


[01-May-21 06:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah just tell her to make another account for now while she figures it out and rank her on that  @KjRBLX


[01-May-21 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
sure


[01-May-21 06:11 PM] ethan;#0003
bruh LOL her ban reason that means she charged back her robux purchase üíÄ


[01-May-21 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
She won‚Äôt get her acc back


[01-May-21 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
Roblox doesn‚Äôt give back accs that are terminated for that I‚Äôve seen it happen to many people


[01-May-21 06:13 PM] stacey#1000
The parents say they didn‚Äôt authorize the charge or whatever and the acc gets banned. They never unban them.

[02-May-21 05:59 PM] cory!#8287

[02-May-21 06:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
who?


[02-May-21 06:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh nvm i see it


[02-May-21 06:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we could rank lock them just to be safe although there isnt that much evidence but better safe than sorry or whatever the saying is


[02-May-21 06:32 PM] cory!#8287
I remember seeing him around as a senior and have been sus of him ever since


[02-May-21 08:18 PM] stacey#1000

[02-May-21 09:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmmm interesting. probably should send her a reminder then, and not leave anyone out purposely for whatever reason. @stacey


[02-May-21 09:51 PM] lyss#0709
i feel like both sam and alex leave ppl out a lot, just from what ive seen but idk


[02-May-21 09:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I honestly thought they would be the inclusive ones tbh


[02-May-21 09:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I didn‚Äôt know they were leaving anyone out


[02-May-21 09:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And if Sams leaving him out for that reason, that‚Äôs kinda messed up


[02-May-21 09:53 PM] lyss#0709
yeah they both seem to have like...idk a judgy attitude towards anyone who isnt their friend..i just get those vibes from them sometimes


[02-May-21 10:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah I agree with a verbal warning


[02-May-21 10:50 PM] stacey#1000
If anyone wants to Dm Sam to speak to her they can. I don‚Äôt have time rn I‚Äôm working a lot more


[02-May-21 11:22 PM] ethan;#0003
Anyone they don‚Äôt call ‚Äúbestie‚Äù they ignore


[03-May-21 02:19 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@xM_inn the photo she sent in general doesn't really reveal much tbh other than just saying for erick to dm her which i mean yeah she got it from staff but like i said no one knows that. most id say is just tell her not to screenshot messages from staff and send them in general.

@stacey does noah have proof of sam just cutting him out after he told her


[03-May-21 02:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
or was it like via vc


[03-May-21 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs all he sent me


[03-May-21 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
I can ask


[03-May-21 02:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we can get proof of that then we have enough proof to warn if necessary


[03-May-21 02:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
so yeah ask if you can please


[03-May-21 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
He said she just started talking to him less over time but no evidence of anything. It just sounds like they drifted apart that‚Äôs it


[03-May-21 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
It happens all the time


[03-May-21 02:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm


[03-May-21 02:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wasnt it noah who said there were other mrs who felt the same


[03-May-21 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[03-May-21 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm asking him if he has other evidence


[03-May-21 02:47 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 do u know which meow they are? cuz if its meowzii im against it cause she was super toxic


[03-May-21 02:52 PM] bonnie591#0591

This  is his second time in a week doing something

He literally just got warned like 4 days ago


[03-May-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure you can temporarily rank lock Eddie and put until further notice in the description


[03-May-21 06:07 PM] stacey#1000
Okay ty


[03-May-21 06:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
If there's enough evidence of toxicity and stuff you can issue his warning 2


[03-May-21 06:07 PM] stacey#1000
I just told both MRs to inform me if anything else happens.


[03-May-21 06:07 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I don‚Äôt think there is enough for it


[03-May-21 06:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Alright


[03-May-21 10:23 PM] lyss#0709
i mean even though she's probably joking, it's 100% not very welcoming or kind to a new MR like what

They still allow safechaters to see number so


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
We should probs let people with safechat apply for Recep


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
Can we just get rid of it yes


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
We said last time to wait a bit just in case it changes back


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
But eh it didn't


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
Cause seniors are asking me about it


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
And idk what to tell them


[05-May-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll just tell them to let them train for recep


[05-May-21 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
We'll make it official tomorrow, @High Rank if anyone has any objections you have till tomorrow before we make an announcement


[05-May-21 06:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
Baby and bear approved it a while ago but we decided to wait just in case


[05-May-21 06:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
They reverted it


[05-May-21 06:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
But it won't happen now I believe


[05-May-21 06:09 PM] cory!#8287
sounds good


[05-May-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[05-May-21 07:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
so we are still not going to allow safechaters to get recept or we found another word to test? or what?


[06-May-21 02:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
We are gonna allow them to


[06-May-21 02:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
Since they can see numbers now


[06-May-21 06:33 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 want me to announce to all MRs about it or are you doing like a public announcement to whole discord server. I‚Äôve had like 5 seniors Dm me about it

:bloxton3: **Safechat Rule** :bloxton3: 

For a few years now, we've only allowed players with safechat to become Housekeeping, Bartender, and Security. Due to ROBLOX tagging numbers for safechatters in the past, we disallowed them to apply for Receptionist.

Within the last few months, ROBLOX has allowed safechatters to see numbers in game, which means there should be no problems with guests and staff discussing room numbers. **Due to this, we will now be allowing safechatters to apply & train for Receptionist.**

No safechat test will be conducted at interviews and trainings from now on, if you are a staff member with safechat and wish to become a Receptionist, then feel free to attend any training session to re-train.

For now, we will not be allowing safechatters to be promoted to MR or HR. We will review this decision in a few months, an announcement will be made if we decided to change this rule.

Any questions? Feel free to ask in #questions!

@Tattoblue we're done!


[07-May-21 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
@anna is that the cb that got appealed before for the discord


[07-May-21 08:45 AM] stacey#1000
Cause if so I don‚Äôt think they should even be allowed to be considered to appeal considering they did before and ruined their chances.


[07-May-21 09:24 AM] bonnie591#0591
@anna Their ban is unappealable due to major toxicity just a few weeks ago


[07-May-21 09:25 AM] bonnie591#0591
Also u should tell them that we can't review their appeal since "our only responsibility is to host"


[07-May-21 09:27 AM] anna#0004
uh i think so


[07-May-21 09:27 AM] anna#0004
okKkKk


[07-May-21 09:40 AM] stacey#1000
Plus what I mentioned if she was already appealed and was a cb she should be perm denied and not appealed again. She‚Äôs always been toxic like that even in the cb server. She shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to  be given a chance to appeal again considering she had her chance and proven she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be appealed again. @anna


[07-May-21 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 ^^


[07-May-21 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
She was the cb stinky or whatever their name was


[07-May-21 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
I would perm deny it


[07-May-21 09:42 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs just my opinion on it though


[07-May-21 09:43 AM] anna#0004
yeah yeah ofc, i can barely remember what cb is which and stuff but i checked her ban reason and it didnt say to never appeal so thought id send it anyway. when i told her it was denied she said she expected it anyway so


[07-May-21 09:43 AM] stacey#1000
I would add on to never appeal it on the ban reason


[07-May-21 09:43 AM] stacey#1000
Unless you can‚Äôt change it idk.


[07-May-21 09:46 AM] anna#0004
ya i dont think u can change the ban reasons without revoking ban and re doing it


[07-May-21 09:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
I'll do dat when I get home


[07-May-21 09:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
We need a non appeal list


[07-May-21 09:46 AM] anna#0004

**Respect towards one another in Staff Lounge**

Greetings MRs,

Unfortunately it has come to the HR teams attention that we have a growing issue of people being disrespectful towards one another in #Staff-lounge. There should be in no way any disrespect towards **anyone** in this team. I don't care for whatever reason it is, we must treat one another with respect. *(This also goes for MR voice calls)*

Myself or the rest of the HR team should never see anyone feeling uncomfortable or upset over something you said. We want to create a fun and friendly environment in our staff channels, and the first step to that is treating everyone the way you want to be treated. No one should ever feel put down or discouraged by something you said. 

Whether you're joking around and having fun or discussing different topics, please be mindful of the things you say to each-other. Words can hurt people, and we most definitely don't want anyone feeling down upon themselves because of hurtful jokes. And it's been said many times in the past, and I'll say it again. **If you don't have anything nice to say, please don't say it at all.**

Keep in mind that **inappropriate behavior, rudeness, and offensive behavior all fall into the category of disrespect. **
**(Also, cursing is allowed but at a respectful limit)**

Let this announcement be a reminder, that way we have everyone on the same page. The HR team most definitely doesn't want to give out consequences to those of you who disregard this message. If you have any questions regarding this matter, feel free to DM me or tag me in #Staff-Discussion.

he talks about how the mr team is full of fakes


[08-May-21 12:01 AM] ethan;#0003
how they fake friendships

[08-May-21 12:02 AM] ethan;#0003
and its honestly true


[08-May-21 12:03 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh shoot I didn‚Äôt even see he resigned ):


[08-May-21 12:04 AM] courtney#5125
well its not like we can change their personalities. some ppl are just like that, its not the whole mr team's fault


[08-May-21 12:04 AM] ethan;#0003
there are a few people i can think of who i think bex is talking about


[08-May-21 12:04 AM] ethan;#0003
samvolley, soccerlover, libby


[08-May-21 12:05 AM] courtney#5125
yeah, but thats just who they r ig


[08-May-21 12:05 AM] ethan;#0003
if you are not on their daily ping, they basicly completely ignore anyone else


[08-May-21 03:14 AM] lyss#0709
VERY TRUE ETHAN


[08-May-21 03:14 AM] lyss#0709
for sure those three, yes


[08-May-21 08:19 AM] stacey#1000
The next time an MR is being disrespectful can we straight up suspend them? I legit have announced that about 3 times and now you just announced again so next time we should just suspend who is doing it @Bloo_Berriez


[08-May-21 08:20 AM] stacey#1000
Making announcements on it over and over clearly isn‚Äôt solving the problem so next time I recommend just suspending who is doing it. I‚Äôve reminded people many times about respect in staff lounge and they keep doing it because we have never suspended anyone for it. We need to do that instead.


[08-May-21 08:22 AM] stacey#1000
@High Rank tagging for thoughts on what I said above.


[08-May-21 08:37 AM] courtney#5125
i agree, we can‚Äôt keep doing announcements on the subject and clearly reminders aren‚Äôt effective


[08-May-21 08:49 AM] Polk#1596
How about we make a rule channel for MRs so we don't need to announce that same thing over and over again


[08-May-21 08:50 AM] Polk#1596
It would list leaking rules, how to treat each other, etc as well as the consequences


[08-May-21 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah that‚Äôs a good idea. So then if they do break it we can refer to it and just straight up suspend them for breaking it. Just a new channel for the discord under announcements probably.


[08-May-21 09:05 AM] courtney#5125
and that would work for new mrs in the months to come who arent aware of all of the past announcements


[08-May-21 10:16 AM] Polk#1596
yup


[08-May-21 11:48 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
depends on how severe. definitely a written warning or suspension though for anyone who does decide to disrespect someone else


[08-May-21 11:48 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ohhh yess I like that


[08-May-21 01:02 PM] Polk#1596
yessir!


[08-May-21 01:02 PM] Polk#1596
since you guys like the idea im gonna start writing up a draft and let u guys suggest changes


[08-May-21 01:02 PM] Polk#1596
once im done hosting


[08-May-21 10:34 PM] courtney#5125
madi noticed that theres been a lack of suggestions in the promotion suggestions channel. she asked if we could make an announcement to remind managers to use that channel, do yall think thats needed?


[08-May-21 11:27 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs been getting leaked no


[08-May-21 11:27 PM] stacey#1000
Plus we are at limit so


[08-May-21 11:27 PM] stacey#1000
Not really needed rn


[08-May-21 11:28 PM] courtney#5125
ok, just passing it on from madi

@High Rank If you're available and wish to join the building contest to help with judging the projects that the MRs are currently building, be sure to join! You'll be given admin powers and you'll be free to play music and watch them build. I'll also be promoting littlesglow to Management at the end of this event which should be pretty cool so if you'd like to help with that, you're free to do so.

[09-May-21 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 I didn‚Äôt put 2 on my checklist this week because the one training I did I had a senior take over and I didn‚Äôt attend the session cause of last minute plans so I only put 1 for the interviews I did


[09-May-21 03:33 PM] stacey#1000
So it‚Äôs 2 cards but only 1 I was there fully for so that‚Äôs why


[09-May-21 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
Alright ty for letting me know

eddies such a trouble maker


[10-May-21 01:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
That's so...


[10-May-21 01:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Why would he even say that?


[10-May-21 02:53 PM] cory!#8287
just out of curiosity is there a reason the questions channel has slowmo


[10-May-21 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
Do you think we should suspend him or anything?


[10-May-21 02:55 PM] cory!#8287
hmm I mean he should definitely get another warning but I‚Äôm not sure about a suspension in my opinion


[10-May-21 02:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
prob to keep people from flooding with questions or to sum it up in message instead of doing something like this:


[10-May-21 02:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
what in the world...


[10-May-21 02:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
what is the receptionist job do?


[10-May-21 02:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean, I just don't know...


[10-May-21 03:02 PM] cory!#8287
ah makes sense ty


[10-May-21 03:13 PM] stacey#1000
Anyone want to send a warning to eddie?


[10-May-21 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
I sent him one legit like a week or so ago so


[10-May-21 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
I won‚Äôt be sending him this one


[10-May-21 03:24 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-21 03:25 PM] bonnie591#0591

[10-May-21 06:10 PM] cory!#8287
i can do it since no one else wants to


[10-May-21 07:13 PM] cory!#8287
@stacey what would the reason for the warning be?


[10-May-21 07:21 PM] stacey#1000
Making disrespectful comments in staff lounge that make others feel uncomfortable and if he asks for evidence send this

[10-May-21 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
And if he tries acting like he did nothing there is more evidence of him causing drama from the week before

And being disrespectful by saying things like ‚Äútake a chill pill‚Äù


[10-May-21 07:27 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! so main reason is making disrespectful comments in staff lounge


[10-May-21 07:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If we get another report on Eddie he‚Äôs getting a suspension


[10-May-21 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I got 2 reports within a week. I got him rank locked to head for now


[10-May-21 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs far far away from ever getting management


[10-May-21 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
I will never understand why MRs mass tag people to say ‚Äúomg happy 1 week.‚Äù Or ‚Äúomg happy 15 months as an MR!‚Äù It makes no sense to me

bro I HATE IT


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
SO MUCH


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
OMG


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
I WANT TO


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
JUST


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
WARN THEM ALL FOR SPAM


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] stacey#1000
Same


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
well


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
WE TECHNICALLY CAN


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] ethan;#0003
üòº


[12-May-21 10:38 AM] stacey#1000
I wish we could ask them not to mass tag people like that and flood a whole channel with that when it‚Äôs literally pointless


[12-May-21 10:38 AM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs a 1 year it‚Äôs fine but like 1 week, 3 months, 17 months??? Tf is the point


[12-May-21 10:38 AM] ethan;#0003
its gotten to the point, where i dont even want to speak to the mrs anymore because its impossible to have a converstion without daily tags getting spammed inbewteen messages or people responding "thank you" or people saying "happy .... months"


[12-May-21 10:38 AM] stacey#1000
@High Rank thoughts?? Pls ^^


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] ethan;#0003
next one i see thats more then 3 lines im warning for spam


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828
happy 3 1/2 hours @ethan;


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] ethan;#0003
tatto


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] ethan;#0003
IM GOING TO HIT U


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] stacey#1000
Can we like announce the the MRs not to do it


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs literally annoying


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yes i think a announcement will be good


[12-May-21 10:39 AM] stacey#1000
One person does it then others copy and paste the same thing


[12-May-21 10:40 AM] stacey#1000
And flood it with it


[12-May-21 10:40 AM] katie#0200
i mean i don't think it's a massive issue, it's like telling people to stop being annoying


[12-May-21 10:40 AM] katie#0200
it's not really harming anyone


[12-May-21 10:40 AM] stacey#1000
Still really pointless though.


[12-May-21 10:40 AM] ethan;#0003
this and then 20 people responding to it brings nothing except spam

[12-May-21 10:40 AM] stacey#1000
And they technically shouldn‚Äôt be mass tagging multiple people like that either


[12-May-21 10:40 AM] ethan;#0003
daily pings are bad enough, but that is just POINTLESS


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm adding a vote for an announcement


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
If it gets enough I won‚Äôt be making the announcement


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
Or like


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
Just warn people mass tagging


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] bonnie591#0591
its nice but maybe they should dm them or only do it if its important, like 42 months and 17 months isnt a milestone like 1 month is


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] ethan;#0003
@stacey i asked the mrs to show me their daily pings i want to see how big they are

[12-May-21 10:42 AM] katie#0200
ok yeah those lists are stupid


[12-May-21 10:42 AM] katie#0200
but the ones when theyre like congratulating them on 1 year or smth is fine, it's a nice thing to celebrate ig


[12-May-21 10:43 AM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 you should turn that setting on with one of the bots that auto deletes messages and warns them if they ping over a certain amount of people


[12-May-21 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
lets see


[12-May-21 10:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
well everyone is gonna be pissed if i do thatt


[12-May-21 10:45 AM] ethan;#0003
libbys got deleted in SL


[12-May-21 10:45 AM] ethan;#0003
look rn


[12-May-21 10:45 AM] ethan;#0003
they are mad


[12-May-21 10:45 AM] ethan;#0003
:aPES_Laugh:


[12-May-21 10:45 AM] ethan;#0003
this is funny


[12-May-21 10:45 AM] katie#0200
i think a reminder announcement to not post stupid mass pings like a toxic list would be enough


[12-May-21 10:46 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm fine if they say like happy 1 year or 1 month but it‚Äôs when it‚Äôs like happy 2 weeks, 27 months, etc when it‚Äôs annoying


[12-May-21 10:46 AM] ethan;#0003
happy 433234 days


[12-May-21 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
We should tell them not to tag multiple people. Like if it‚Äôs 10+ people


[12-May-21 10:47 AM] katie#0200
tbf tho telling people when and when they can't congratulate others on a milestone seems a bit controlling even if the milestones are really insignificant like 2 and a half months


[12-May-21 10:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
do we want this enabled where it deletes a message if it reaches certain number of pings, if so how many. people will get triggered if we did this tho

[12-May-21 10:48 AM] stacey#1000
Idek


[12-May-21 10:48 AM] ethan;#0003
they can still congradulate them, but just not spam SL with a 20 line message


[12-May-21 10:49 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not saying not to congratulate it‚Äôs when they spam it with multiple people when it‚Äôs annoying


[12-May-21 10:49 AM] stacey#1000
Like when they literally flood sl with it


[12-May-21 10:49 AM] stacey#1000
With like 10+ tags

[12-May-21 10:49 AM] ethan;#0003
like this


[12-May-21 10:49 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
is 10 a good amount to put it to?


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
applies to gd as well


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
if they tagged like 3 people or so thats fine but tagging 15 people over a 20 line message is TOO much


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
and all other channels


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] stacey#1000
10 is good


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
10 is still a lot, they will still do one message per line and itll still spam it


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
i could probs disable it in certain channels if needed


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
any channels that would need it disabling?


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] katie#0200
photo gallery


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
can you make it less in SL and GD?


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
cus people will still do one tag per line


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] stacey#1000
How many is good then @ethan;


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] katie#0200
in case theyre pinging for a pic w lots of people or something


[12-May-21 10:50 AM] ethan;#0003
6-7 maybe


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill disable in photo gallery


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] ethan;#0003
cus 10 is a lot if they do double space lines


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] ethan;#0003
thats 20 lines


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] stacey#1000
Ok 6-7 is good


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] ethan;#0003
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/698763137607925855/842064375812587550/image1.png look how big this message is with 12 tags

[12-May-21 10:51 AM] ethan;#0003
just two less is 10


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] cory!#8287
yeah i agree with that they shouldn‚Äôt mass spam people and send daily pings but they should at least be allowed to ping like 1 or 2 people congratulating them on a milestone


[12-May-21 10:51 AM] stacey#1000
6 is reasonable


[12-May-21 10:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
you could do an announcement telling them theres now a limit but u cant put spaces between lines


[12-May-21 10:52 AM] ethan;#0003
i dont think it should be announced unless people start to question it


[12-May-21 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah just do the limit thing and no announcement


[12-May-21 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
That was the main issue


[12-May-21 10:52 AM] katie#0200
i mean it's not like it's their fault they've reached a milestone üò© we have loads of mrs and of course it's likely there'll be at least 1 person hitting a milestone every day


[12-May-21 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
If we announce it will get leaked and people will find ways around it


[12-May-21 10:53 AM] ethan;#0003
if a lot of people question it, then we can announce it to the mrs and the mrs an answer them when they ask about it


[12-May-21 10:53 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 what you setting limit to


[12-May-21 10:54 AM] ethan;#0003
i think someone is about to send their daily ping did u set it i want to see if it works


[12-May-21 10:54 AM] bonnie591#0591
how about 7


[12-May-21 10:54 AM] stacey#1000
Ok that‚Äôs good


[12-May-21 10:54 AM] ethan;#0003
yeah thats reasonable


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think if i set it to "warn" it will tell them not to ping people


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
but i can just set it to "delete"


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] bonnie591#0591
warn wont log it on their record


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah just do delete


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] ethan;#0003
can you set it so it messages them not to spam tag


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] stacey#1000
If it warns people will send in warn appeal tickets a lot more


[12-May-21 10:55 AM] ethan;#0003
but doesnt log on their record


[12-May-21 10:56 AM] bonnie591#0591

managers and seniors


[12-May-21 11:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
and only for heads


[12-May-21 11:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
then im gonna disable it as thats not fair


[12-May-21 11:01 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[12-May-21 11:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
should i ask them to


[12-May-21 11:02 AM] bonnie591#0591
well one head


[12-May-21 11:02 AM] bonnie591#0591
and one manager


[12-May-21 11:02 AM] bonnie591#0591
do daily pings


[12-May-21 11:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[12-May-21 11:05 AM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 is there a way for mods not to bypass it


[12-May-21 11:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
i cant see anything in settings so


[12-May-21 11:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
presuming not


[12-May-21 11:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
theres something to allow a role to bypass it


[12-May-21 11:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
but since this is automod


[12-May-21 11:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
and they are mods cuz they can warn people


[12-May-21 11:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
they can bypass it


[12-May-21 11:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
so i just recommend y'all announce that they can do it but dont spam it and make it many linse

It‚Äôs 3 for each group so I figured since there is 3 alliance rep for Koala for bh we can each apply so that‚Äôs why I already did. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGzMTlJP4tH2G4cIHrCQrznybl_VLtqCFZ2qpfqP0NVeMWQA/viewform?usp=sf_link

ok np!!!


[17-May-21 07:12 AM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez Kyle and maya. They both discussed it being challenging to get all 4 hosting requirements done because they don‚Äôt get servers all the time for sessions or etc


[17-May-21 07:13 AM] stacey#1000
And how it‚Äôs more challenging cause there is never 2nd server for interviews either


[17-May-21 07:24 AM] stacey#1000
They want to see if it‚Äôs possible to get it lowered to 3 instead of 4 a week mainly and have 3 shifts and 3 sessions. So I decided to have a meeting with seniors to discuss with all of them how they feel about it, etc

Ok I‚Äôll send something here to get your opinion on


[17-May-21 03:46 PM] stacey#1000
Cause if she gets banned again she won‚Äôt get appealed again


[17-May-21 03:48 PM] stacey#1000
@anna do you remember when she got appealed


[17-May-21 03:49 PM] anna#0004

[17-May-21 03:52 PM] anna#0004
sounds like most other formers tbh, making assumptions as usual and causing unnecessary drama

yeah the formers attack builder ever since that time when he warned a few of them for causing drama in the server


[17-May-21 03:54 PM] anna#0004
so they target him a lot


[17-May-21 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
I feel bad. He‚Äôs asking if she can get banned again for it


[17-May-21 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm looking to see if there is more evidence


[17-May-21 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I think we should get more before banning again


[17-May-21 03:55 PM] anna#0004
yeayea ofc


[17-May-21 03:55 PM] anna#0004

are we allowed to kick people for report related warnings now? a manager said they received different answers :1catooo:


[19-May-21 12:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
what is..


[19-May-21 12:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"report related warnings"


[19-May-21 12:40 PM] emily#4444
warnings like that, there used to be a rule where they wouldnt count towards being kicked/banned

no they dont count towards a kick i dont think we ever changed that


[19-May-21 01:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
once i finish my exams ill finish the new rules / guidelines for punishment things. basically for now they should only kick them if they are pretty much doing it on purpose or have way too many warnings for it. for example; i kicked someone for having like 10 report warnings yesterday since they clearly arent making any efforts to change sooo theres no point to continue warning them for it


[19-May-21 01:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
we'll have another manager vote soon as we've dropped below 55. just wanna see if any other manager resigns cuz im pretty sure i saw something about luke resigning soon cuz someone saw them working on "resignation doc" but idk they may have changed their mind

out of everyone I wouldn‚Äôt have expected ace to show that ngl


[22-May-21 11:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
I mean its only one single message from bot logs that was leaked to staff lounge. Management+ already have access to bot logs so its only the heads which that one message was leaked to, and I doubt all of the heads even realised. This seems like a genuine mistake and there's clearly no malicious intent. This could easily be corrected with a simple warning or reminder to be more careful with how she distributes information. I also don't think one simple mistake should effect her standing considering how much hard work, activity, and dedication she's put into Bloxton **consistently** for the past year.


[22-May-21 11:59 AM] courtney#5125
i agree, it wasnt anything malignant, the screenshot she sent just exposed someone pinging her in mr memories. i doubt she even realized what she was sending


[22-May-21 12:05 PM] cory!#8287
i agree with u bonnie.


[22-May-21 12:06 PM] cory!#8287
ace is a great worker but as u said there‚Äôs a lot of competition for shift


[22-May-21 12:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
I wouldn't say suspension. She has no history of current consequences and I don't see how a suspension would correct a genuine mistake anymore than a warning would for the first offensive.


[22-May-21 12:07 PM] courtney#5125
a warning would probably suffice, imo. what she sent wasnt overly confidential or anything, but she should still be aware that she needs to be careful about what she sends. and yeah competition for shift is high right now, but like min said, jess has put in a lot of hard work and effort into her current job, and itd be unfair to disregard that because of a small mistake


[22-May-21 12:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
^


[22-May-21 12:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
we can do a warning if hrs agree on it, ill agree on the warning as well


[22-May-21 12:09 PM] cory!#8287
other seniors have put just as much effort into their positions as well, for example drizzle she does like 4-5 shifts every day alongside sessions


[22-May-21 12:10 PM] courtney#5125
yes, and jess works just as hard. a lot of seniors do


[22-May-21 12:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
and for future shift votes, her past will still be recognised but this must be noted. i have no problem with allowing her to be hired in a few months or whatever but if we have a shift vote real soon, we have to allow other seniors who work hard to get the position first if they were hired before or at the same time as her


[22-May-21 12:11 PM] cory!#8287
I do agree she‚Äôd be a great shift manager but I personally think we should consider others before her (just my opinion)


[22-May-21 12:13 PM] courtney#5125
i think shes one of our hardest working seniors, its just not fair to focus more on an accident than the numerous months of effort. she clearly wasnt trying to do anything wrong, and i dont think we've ever had any issues with her before. if we gave her a warning, i find it hard to believe shed let the mistake happen again


[22-May-21 12:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
We should hire based on who's the best candidate(s) at the time of the vote. My main concern is how we're going to address this situation as I don't believe any punishment more than a warning would be fair or justice. It was a simple and unmalicious mistake which can be corrected with the right guidance. The fact she has no history of disciplinary so far speaks for itself.

I agree with what Courtney said too.


[22-May-21 12:14 PM] courtney#5125
obviously leaking cant be completely overlooked, but it doesnt change her devotion to the group


[22-May-21 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
If she wanted to seriously leak and cause harm, she could've down much worser than that; but Jess isn't like that. She is trustworthy and very competent for her position.


[22-May-21 12:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think we should keep everything mentioned above by Bonnie, Cory, Courtney, and myself in mind. Anyways!


[22-May-21 12:18 PM] cory!#8287
yeah a warning seems fair


[22-May-21 12:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@bonnie591 just out of curiosity, how much longer will these management voting styles go on for? Just curious since we aren‚Äôt as packed with managers as we were when we first started doing them since we had like 64 managers or something now we‚Äôre at a pretty decent size, 53


[22-May-21 12:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
only a few more times. the reason why im still doing it is to ensure the best people get picked for the position and also to ensure that we dont end up having more managers than heads as whenever a manager is hired, manager increases by one and head decreases by 1, if head isnt replaced quickly and that happens a few times it can go back to that so yeahh


[22-May-21 12:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
alrighty


[22-May-21 01:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

I mean she did just get warned so uh


[22-May-21 04:30 PM] stacey#1000

[22-May-21 04:33 PM] emily#4444
no problem!!


[22-May-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
For me it be between ace and maya


[22-May-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
For time zones wise I think drizzle and maya but activity wise ace and drizzle.


[22-May-21 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve had seniors that are like in pst time or later complain about being harder to do sessions cause they never get hosted later for them so I think maya be able to help with that a lot and drizzle be able to help bst a lot.


[22-May-21 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
We wait and see


[22-May-21 05:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I definitely will consider Drizzle for shift. I mean it was an accident what she did. I don‚Äôt think it was her intentions. If we do decide to hold her back idk who else I would pick. I mean Maya is good. I also really like Armani but idk when his promo date to senior was. I think he‚Äôs on the newer side if I‚Äôm not wrong. Idk we‚Äôll see


[22-May-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm leaning towards drizzle and maya more for timezone reasons and activity and maturity as well


[22-May-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
I definitely want to see ace as Shift though she‚Äôs still a strong candidate. But I think maybe she needs a bit longer considering she did just leak.


[22-May-21 05:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah Maya would be really helpful on like west coast side since I‚Äôm the only HR from this side


[22-May-21 05:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Since MST is only an hour ahead of PST


[22-May-21 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
Mhm. I really think that timezone needs a lot of help. EST is doing good. I‚Äôve legit had like 2-3 seniors complain it‚Äôs hard to get sessions in because of their timezone being mst or pst and nothing was ever hosted later for them.


[22-May-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
What we need is


[22-May-21 05:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah. When I host I try to host later in night cause of that


[22-May-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-May-21 05:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
Or we could walk there


[22-May-21 05:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah and Maya is good when it comes to checklists so timezone isn‚Äôt only factor. She‚Äôs active but we‚Äôll see when the voting time comes around definitely voting for drizzle though


[22-May-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
How do you walk on water


[22-May-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-May-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
Nah


[22-May-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah for sure drizzle would be my first vote because she‚Äôs been a senior longer


[22-May-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I want to see ace but she just leaked so that‚Äôs why I think she needs longer


[22-May-21 05:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean Ace is still a good senior. If we were to hold her back it would just be this one time.


[22-May-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
For sure like she wouldn‚Äôt be held back long


[22-May-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
I think just one vote considering we are probably getting vote soon going into summer


[22-May-21 05:47 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-May-21 05:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[22-May-21 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
The same day ace did


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs been a senior same length as her


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And like said, it wouldn‚Äôt be that long tbh. Guarantee that Ace will get shift by end of this year


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
And maya can really really help us out timezone wise. That‚Äôs a huge factor we need to consider


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah all 3 of them were promoted around same time


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Think Drizzle is only a week older than ace and Maya


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
Mhm


[22-May-21 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
All of them are amazing


[22-May-21 05:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
One bad thing tho is


[22-May-21 05:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ace nearly has 1100 more comments on her checklist compared to maya


[22-May-21 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think we should look at only comments on a card


[22-May-21 05:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
Its a good activity indicator though


[22-May-21 05:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hmmmm


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey did any est seniors say they struggle getting a server


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
No


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
It was people on pst and mst


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
And Australia‚Äô time


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
EST is doing perfectly fine


[22-May-21 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
Cause we have me, Cory, lyss, and Courtney hosting a lot. Court and lyss are only 1 hour behind est


[22-May-21 05:53 PM] stacey#1000
But pst never gets sessions hosted later and they have struggle getting sessions


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
It sucks tbh, its always been unfixable


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I think maya could help a lot. She‚Äôs MST


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
Can host later sessions for pst and mst


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôll try getting some sessions in for PST later at night to help them out


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
I feel bad you only pst one Bloo


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôm the lonely hr on the west coast :pepecry:


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] stacey#1000
Yes so we need maya!!!


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
everyone is either cst or est for America


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] stacey#1000
We need someone mst.


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] stacey#1000
Is that like


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] stacey#1000
Only 1 hour ahead of you


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] stacey#1000
Close enough right


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
I do think maya is a good senior in quality but


[22-May-21 05:57 PM] stacey#1000
Let‚Äôs just wait for a vote and see how many we are allowed to get then go from there


[22-May-21 05:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we have really good PST seniors. Hopefully one day once they‚Äôre ready to move up, they‚Äôre able to also help out


[22-May-21 05:58 PM] stacey#1000
I think maya, ace and drizzle are all more then ready. But ace just needs a tiny bit more time. That‚Äôs just my opinion


[22-May-21 06:01 PM] cory!#8287
if madi was active she'd help out with timezones cuz shes aussie time


[22-May-21 06:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought Madi was pretty active. Didn‚Äôt we have like immaturity issues with her though in past


[22-May-21 06:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
She gets like 70% on her checklists even when she‚Äôs on a notice


[22-May-21 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Madi would be good for timezones but I don't think she's ready just yet


[22-May-21 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
I can never host later like ever. I work really really early 5 days a Week and wake up at 5:30 or 6am


[22-May-21 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
I cry


[22-May-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
üíî


[22-May-21 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
And I‚Äôve been done school since April so I also cry


[22-May-21 06:06 PM] stacey#1000
I have less time with working full time


[22-May-21 06:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean honestly the latest a session for est that gets hosted is like at 8 PM for pst. So it‚Äôs not that bad tbh. I think once summer rolls around that all may change with like EST Hrs hosting at like 12 am and 1 am which is 10 pm for later time zones. Plus I‚Äôll host so. I think rn school just factors in.


[22-May-21 06:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea


[22-May-21 06:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Also


[22-May-21 06:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Bloo remember summer 2017


[22-May-21 06:08 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-May-21 06:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Full


[22-May-21 06:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg yes


[22-May-21 06:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya we don't want that again LOL


[22-May-21 06:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I miss 2017 summer. It just gave off like a vibe


[22-May-21 06:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I miss summers 2017 and 2018


[22-May-21 06:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sameee


[22-May-21 06:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Those were the best


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
I remember v4 and all that


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Old training center


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
The v4 music :PES_CryTeddy:


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Omg v4 :pepecry:


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I liked V5 too tbh


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yas


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It was cute. I remember everyone was so shook at how many floors it was


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
V4 is my fav tho as I went from receptionist to shift manager there


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It was like 7 floors LOL


[22-May-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yas


[22-May-21 06:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah v4 was nice.


[22-May-21 06:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
V4 was winter Lodge themed and ugh it was so nice and cozy


[22-May-21 06:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
During the winter it felt so cozy


[22-May-21 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
The ice rink too omg


[22-May-21 06:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LOL Yes that replaced the pool didn‚Äôt it


[22-May-21 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes and I think pool was indoor as well


[22-May-21 06:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I lowkey miss the v3 elevators just cause it was hilarious when they would glitch with people inside


[22-May-21 06:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OH YEAH


[22-May-21 06:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it was inside


[22-May-21 06:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
I swear bear fixed them often and then they broke a day later LOL


[22-May-21 06:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Memoriess


[22-May-21 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
So 1 now, then 2 maybe in august or July or something?


[22-May-21 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
That would work


[22-May-21 06:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yas


[22-May-21 06:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Bloo_Berriez I think we should consider firing faith! How unholy!


[22-May-21 06:21 PM] cory!#8287
drizzle did like more shifts today than i ever did in a week as a senior üò≠


[22-May-21 06:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOLL


[22-May-21 06:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

@KjRBLX @stacey assigned to manager promotions, u may promote when ready!


[26-May-21 12:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
The good thing abt the hotel is people cant rlly impersonate staff successfuly with display names unless they are staff themselves


[26-May-21 05:10 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX roy is on my int server jsyk


[26-May-21 10:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
That‚Äôs upsetting to see from her but looks like the first couple screenshots are from DMs, no? And then are the 2nd batch of screenshots from Tsunami Sushi‚Äôs general discussion?


[26-May-21 10:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@ethan;


[26-May-21 10:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Also they date back to February so I‚Äôm not sure where those came from.


[26-May-21 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
The 2 pictures from feb are from Bloxton general discussion


[26-May-21 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
It looks like bh general discussion


[26-May-21 10:47 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs all from a DM and then 2 old pictures from general discussion


[26-May-21 10:52 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Ohh


[26-May-21 10:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Well I mean, Pansy wasn‚Äôt an MR then and it is from February. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs much we can do, what you guys think?


[26-May-21 10:54 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if it was in DMs we can‚Äôt do too much. If the person was arguing with her in DMs they should‚Äôve blocked her. We could warn her but like idk


[26-May-21 10:55 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn‚Äôt seem major to me given it was in DMs and then old photos


[26-May-21 10:56 PM] stacey#1000
If it was like in tsunami sushi discord server or game or something then yeah


[26-May-21 10:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah same that‚Äôs what I was thinking. I mean if anything we can always rank lock her until we feel she‚Äôs matured


[26-May-21 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
To me it seems like they are just trying to get her in trouble for arguing in DMs and reported it to tsunami sushi instead of an HR here


[26-May-21 10:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who is that person anyways


[26-May-21 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
Idek


[26-May-21 10:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The dms are confusing me.


[26-May-21 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
I mean we def can‚Äôt terminate or suspend for that I don‚Äôt think. It doesn‚Äôt seem major to me


[26-May-21 10:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[26-May-21 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think we should do anything tbh


[26-May-21 10:59 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs minor


[26-May-21 11:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If anything I‚Äôd probably just not want her as a manager ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[26-May-21 11:01 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah we could do like a temp rank lock of like a month or two or something


[26-May-21 11:02 PM] stacey#1000
and we could just tell tsunami sushi she is not eligible for manager because of it idk


[26-May-21 11:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Could someone educate me and show the transphobicness in the DMs?..like I see this but its cut so its kinda out of context.. and the first image..."hissy fit" well what exactly did Pansy say before Pans said hissy fit


[26-May-21 11:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
like the puzzle pieces aren't connecting for me..

[26-May-21 11:08 PM] stacey#1000
Cause Idk


[26-May-21 11:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
same


[26-May-21 11:08 PM] lyss#0709
it's transphobic because she isn't respecting neopronouns basically


[26-May-21 11:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Is that in the bottom picture which are from like Feb?


[26-May-21 11:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If so, I saw that.


[26-May-21 11:09 PM] lyss#0709
and is calling them "nicknames" when she doesn't have the right to talk about them and degrade people who use neopronouns


[26-May-21 11:10 PM] lyss#0709
definitely not okay, but yeah it looks like the screenshots are from a few months ago. she really just needs to not talk about those topics publicly when it's obviously offensive to people and educate herself instead


[26-May-21 11:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah. I personally wouldn‚Äôt want someone like that making their way up our ranks. not until I feel like she‚Äôs able to respect others opinions


[27-May-21 05:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank dont do this!!


[27-May-21 05:00 AM] bonnie591#0591

Ty tatto!!


[28-May-21 06:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'll DM u nearer the time with more info


[28-May-21 02:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
If we do warning then:

It's rea's first warning

It's travels and canaries second warning

It's selmas third warning


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
so selma and canary should be rank locked


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
same with travel


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
not perm


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
Selma would need a suspension too


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
but temp


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
like 3 month rank lock?


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
and yeah selma can get suspended


[28-May-21 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
im also thinking i should make an announcment to all mrs about trolling at other groups that are not allies


[28-May-21 02:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Travel won't get senior in 3 months so no point rank locking him


[28-May-21 02:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
The others sure


[28-May-21 02:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure


[28-May-21 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
ill def need help sending out these warnings, issuing the suspension, rank locking, and doing an announcement if so thats a lot to do on my own o-o


[28-May-21 02:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
dang they should know better


[28-May-21 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
i can do the announcement and send out a warning to travel or whoever


[28-May-21 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
who else wants to help


[28-May-21 02:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hasn‚Äôt Canary had like 2 warnings of things in past?


[28-May-21 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
im not sure


[28-May-21 02:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What in the world


[28-May-21 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
selma is getting suspended


[28-May-21 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
cause this is her 3rd strike warning wise


[28-May-21 02:15 PM] cory!#8287
what they did was absolutely unacceptable


[28-May-21 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
the only one thats never been warned is rea


[28-May-21 02:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk I feel like Canary should also get a suspension. I feel like she‚Äôs been brought up for so many things, immaturity wise


[28-May-21 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
yeah i was about to say


[28-May-21 02:15 PM] cory!#8287
mhm for sure


[28-May-21 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
we should suspend all of them maybe...?


[28-May-21 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
cause travel has been warned before too


[28-May-21 02:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It‚Äôs just unacceptable what they did. They should knoww better.


[28-May-21 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
suspension only applies to alliances


[28-May-21 02:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but spamming like that? that‚Äôs not right


[28-May-21 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
it shouldnt matter if its an alliance or not it should be for any group


[28-May-21 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
Nova hotels doesnt think very highly of us right now because of it


[28-May-21 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
they all knew what they were doing


[28-May-21 02:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont think nova hotels have ever liked us


[28-May-21 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
still though its another group


[28-May-21 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
and its highly unprofessional


[28-May-21 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
my vote is for 2-3 day suspension if 2 of them would get suspended either way for already having warnings


[28-May-21 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
why not suspend all of them if we would already suspend 2


[28-May-21 02:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
what would be the punishment for trolling at an alliance though


[28-May-21 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
suspension im guessing


[28-May-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
but if we are suspending for trolling at a non alliance group as well then theres no like difference in punishment


[28-May-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes we can suspend for like 2 more days but


[28-May-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
hardly gonna make a difference


[28-May-21 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
we dont have to suspend


[28-May-21 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
so what are we doing then


[28-May-21 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
suspending canary and selma, and warning rea and travel?


[28-May-21 02:21 PM] stacey#1000
then announcement to all of them, and rank locking canary, selma, rea for 3 months or so?


[28-May-21 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
i say warning. if travel and canary does something else they can get their 3rd warning. we can rank lock them as well yes


[28-May-21 02:21 PM] cory!#8287
selma should definitely get suspended since this is her 3rd warning and maybe canary since she has had maturity issues since forever


[28-May-21 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
canary hasnt reached her 3rd warning


[28-May-21 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
if she does something else we'll give her it


[28-May-21 02:22 PM] cory!#8287
oh I thought this was gonna be her third nvm


[28-May-21 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
this is her second warning along with tr2vl as well


[28-May-21 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
ok so i need help with this


[28-May-21 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
i can announce to mrs and warn rea and travel


[28-May-21 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
in the warning letter for travel and canary, i recommend you mention that they are on their 2nd warning


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
who wants to warn canary, suspend selma, and rank lock people


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
i can rank lock


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
and maybe suspend selma


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
how long are u suspending


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
3 days?


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
3 days


[28-May-21 02:23 PM] stacey#1000

[28-May-21 02:23 PM] stacey#1000

[28-May-21 02:24 PM] stacey#1000
ok one more who wants to warn canary


[28-May-21 02:24 PM] cory!#8287
I‚Äôve warned canary in the past so I‚Äôd rather not warn her


[28-May-21 02:24 PM] stacey#1000
im writing reas warning thing rn


[28-May-21 02:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
i gotta eat dinner first


[28-May-21 02:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I can warn her but I‚Äôm not home rn so if someone would want to make the letter and I can send or if someone else wants to do it


[28-May-21 02:25 PM] stacey#1000
ill write the letter if u want to send it


[28-May-21 02:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
alright


[28-May-21 02:26 PM] stacey#1000
do u want me to add that since its her second warning, a third offence can result in a suspension


[28-May-21 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes pls


[28-May-21 02:27 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[28-May-21 02:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it‚Äôs kinda frustrating when we have mrs go do stupid things. like why do they think it‚Äôs okay to go to another group and just spam. idk


[28-May-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
why on their main accounts as well. do they care abt their reputation


[28-May-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
u shouldnt troll but at least do it on an alt if ur that bored


[28-May-21 02:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ikr. like spamming at another group just ruins your reputation and the overall groups

Greetings onechicagocanary,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've received a formal warning at Bloxton Hotels as of May 28th, 2021 at 3:30 PM EST. The reasoning behind your formal warning is due to trolling at another ROBLOX group, acting highly unprofessional, and painting a bad image for Bloxton. Trolling at other groups that is not an alliance is highly unacceptable. If you wouldn't troll at an alliance, you should not be trolling on any ROBLOX group. This is your **2nd** issued warning and we would like to remind you that a 3rd warning can result in a suspension. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a formal warning in an effort to remind you of your wrongdoings. We ask you to take this formal warning as a reminder and work towards improvement in the future to prevent any further implications. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

**Trolling at Non-Allied Groups**

Greetings, MR team.

It has been brought to the HR teams attention that many of you have been going around to other ROBLOX groups and committing major offences such as spamming, trolling, and acting highly unprofessional to get banned. This is **highly unacceptable** as you should NEVER act unprofessional at another group just because it is not an alliance.

You are already aware not to troll at alliances, but that does not mean it is okay to do it to any other group. I thought this was already clear to you all, but it is clearly not as many of you think it is funny to go to another group and troll. You all deal with the trollers at the hotel and can get very frustrated with it, so how do you think another group feels when you go do the exact same thing to them? 

Zero tolerance to this behaviour, those involved have been given consequences and if any of you are caught doing this after this announcement is made, expect a suspension. Let this be your only reminder. NEVER troll at another group and act unprofessional. Be the role models you are suppose to be and don't paint a bad image for Bloxton.

If you have any concerns or questions regarding this announcement feel free to ask me or another member of the HR team.

Sincerely,
staceyzn
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels


[28-May-21 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
there


[28-May-21 02:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey really good


[28-May-21 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
:bloxton3: **Warning and Suspension** :bloxton3: 

Greetings, **SeLmArOcKs123**

It has come to the attention of the HR team that you've shown severe misconduct within another hotel group. Although they aren't an alliance, we still expect our MRs to represent Bloxton in all other groups. Therefore, this has lead to you receiving a **warning.**

This is your **3rd warning** you have recieved during your employment at Bloxton Hotels. As you may know, 3 warnings lead to an automatic suspension, therefore you have been **suspended from your position of Head Receptionist for 3 days.**

If you have any questions, then please feel free to ask. We hope that this suspension allows you to improve, as further warnings may result in you being dismissed from your position here.

Yours truly,
**bonnie591**
**Board of Directors**

[30-May-21 10:20 PM] Beartikal#9760

[30-May-21 10:20 PM] Beartikal#9760

[30-May-21 10:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
