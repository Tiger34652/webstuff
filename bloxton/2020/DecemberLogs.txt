Greetings Sievrra,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as 9 | Head of Services from Bloxton Hotels as of December 3rd, 2020, at 4:50 PM CST. The reasoning behind your termination is due to leaking images from #staff-lounge. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Best regards,

c6urtney
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

she leaked several messages from staff lounge @babymariobebe

Which ones in specific?

[03-Dec-20 05:01 PM] courtney#5125
she was upset i was asking her and other mrs to be nice when someone asks if smthg is bypassing


[03-Dec-20 05:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Why does it qualify as leaking? It's just a conversation of you politely warning her, nothing to do with records?


[03-Dec-20 05:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@babymariobebe those images are from staff lounge, she should know not to share images from the staff lounge to people who are not Mrs


[03-Dec-20 05:04 PM] courtney#5125
those messages were sent to someone whos not an mr


[03-Dec-20 05:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
It's not just that though it's restricted because of the content, me taking a picture of something like someone talking about how they enjoy bloxton in staff lounge wouldn't get me fired if I were a staff would it?


[03-Dec-20 05:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The image is just you politely warning her it's nothing having to do with trainings or records and such


[03-Dec-20 05:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
She was clearly upset and wanted to vent but I don't believe that image contains anything that would qualify as leaking


[03-Dec-20 05:06 PM] courtney#5125
but it was still something sent in staff lounge, and the receiver of the message knew that it was from staff lounge. sierras been an mr for several months, she knows leaking isnt allowed and shes seen several people terminated for it


[03-Dec-20 05:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
We‚Äôve made it clear to all of the mrs that they can‚Äôt share images from staff lounge to other people. We‚Äôve fired others for doing similar things. And she‚Äôs a former MR as well, so she should be familiar with the rules considering how long she‚Äôs been here. She‚Äôs also been suspended multiple times so, she‚Äôs had a lot of chances


[03-Dec-20 05:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
We should be able to differentiate what should qualify under such things, the point of the leaking rule is to prevent the spreading of important records, and if this is not the case we should reconsider the penalty


[03-Dec-20 05:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
If I take a picture of someone saying Hi to me does that get me fired, are there really no exceptions to the rule?


[03-Dec-20 05:11 PM] courtney#5125
we've terminated many people for leaking, all messages sent in staff lounge should be terminable, she sent numerous screenshots to someone who isnt an mr, and she elaborated on the situation to that user. shes done many things in the past that she was suspended for, i believe shes been suspended 3 times already, so i think shes had many chances


[03-Dec-20 05:13 PM] courtney#5125
if someone just leaked someone saying "Hi" in staff lounge, im sure we'd consider a different punishment like a suspension or warning. that goes the same with someone accidentally leaking. but she leaked a large portion of staff lounge on purpose and she explained what happened in staff lounge in her own words

[03-Dec-20 05:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
He didn‚Äôt really leak anything ‚Äúimportant‚Äù but he still leaked so he got terminated


[03-Dec-20 05:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
We gotta be fairr


[03-Dec-20 05:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
That's fine as you guys have come to a consensus but I don't want to see this again, we need to have to rule stick to it's intended purpose, which is, preventing the spreading of misinformation and leaking of important logs and documents concerning daily duties.

Also a warning for leaking a meaningless conversation such as "Hi" and daily chit chat is definitely harsh, honestly stuff like this is not necessary to be enforced. Let me know if I need to adjust the rules as necessary and make it clear to you guys.


[03-Dec-20 05:17 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Also that guy's termination is sad to see, truly.


[03-Dec-20 05:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[03-Dec-20 05:46 PM] courtney#5125
i dont have any issue with re-evaluating the rule, its just that it wouldnt be fair to not terminate sierra right now when weve terminated other people for leaking similar things


[03-Dec-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
wait the thing about sierra is from november 15th...


[03-Dec-20 05:48 PM] ethan;#0003
why is that being reported now???


[03-Dec-20 05:48 PM] courtney#5125

[03-Dec-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
took her 17 days to decide to report her friend because she thinks it might of been in an mr channel


[03-Dec-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
from the image they dont know its sl


[03-Dec-20 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
it doesnt say SL


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] courtney#5125
but its from sl


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah it is


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] ethan;#0003
but there is no place in the image it says sl


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] ethan;#0003
so all she can is just assume it is


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] courtney#5125
and ayesha figured that out as soon as she looked and didnt see the messages sent in gd


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] ethan;#0003
but what took her 17 days to report it


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] courtney#5125
no clue


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] ethan;#0003
everytime someone waits more then a few days, there is always soemthing up


[03-Dec-20 05:50 PM] ethan;#0003
like they got into a fight and they arent talking anymore

but then it did so


[05-Dec-20 01:17 PM] courtney#5125

[05-Dec-20 01:17 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think kylie would purpously do that

she is too nice to do that


[05-Dec-20 01:17 PM] lyss#0709
idk, kylie seems pretty two faced


[05-Dec-20 01:18 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i don't see how it'd be an accident.. she asked if she lives in xyz place


[05-Dec-20 01:18 PM] Tattoblue#5828
after sending the ip grabber lol


[05-Dec-20 01:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we're not terming, which I don't think would be too bad considering the circumstances, it needs to be a long suspension


[05-Dec-20 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think maybe she thought it wouldn't work but was surprised it did


[05-Dec-20 01:18 PM] lyss#0709
and who in their right mind can think its okay to make fun of someone for what they look like and then make jokes about cancer


[05-Dec-20 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
she tends to just play it off

[05-Dec-20 01:20 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Dec-20 01:20 PM] lyss#0709
hadley's shown her face on vcs and in her pfps, and has made that public, but they shouldnt be sending pictures of her, making fun of how she looks, and joking about her experience with cancer are you kidding me


[05-Dec-20 01:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
thats literally cyber-bullying in some circumstances and honestly sickening


[05-Dec-20 01:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
termination imo


[05-Dec-20 01:21 PM] xM_inn#2821
the ip grabbing alone is bad enough


[05-Dec-20 01:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Before we go any, the IP logger messages


[05-Dec-20 01:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Does someone still have access to those?

[05-Dec-20 01:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
can't believe people have the heart to do things like this


[05-Dec-20 01:26 PM] lyss#0709
i have no idea what kind of sad person you have to be to think its okay to be so mean to someone


[05-Dec-20 01:27 PM] courtney#5125
theres not evidence of her user id but it came from mads, so its very hard to believe mads would try to fake a report to get her best friend in trouble


[05-Dec-20 01:28 PM] courtney#5125
she reported it wanting to remain anonymous bc she knows kylie can dox her


[05-Dec-20 01:28 PM] courtney#5125
and kylie apparently did it to a few other people


[05-Dec-20 01:28 PM] lyss#0709
doesnt kylie have information on like


[05-Dec-20 01:28 PM] lyss#0709
a ton of her friends


[05-Dec-20 01:29 PM] courtney#5125

@xM_inn by the way, when you terminate kylie, if u could try and do ur best to not mention mads or lissa (bc theyre the ones that have been reporting this stuff), thatd be great. if kylie finds out it was those two who reported her, then she'll dox them

o ya we've had conversations with hadley before about her personal info being shared but came to the conclusion we cannot do anything since she legit posts everything for people to view so she has herself to blame


[06-Dec-20 03:25 PM] lyss#0709
oml what is that girl doinggg


[06-Dec-20 03:26 PM] lyss#0709
i mean, hadley still doesnt deserve to be harassed and bullied for having cancer when she was younger, regardless of the information she puts out there


[06-Dec-20 03:42 PM] impact#0297
probably never


[06-Dec-20 03:43 PM] impact#0297
yea but you can't prevent these things from happening when she is very open about her life


[06-Dec-20 03:51 PM] lyss#0709
mmm id agree that that's partly true, you do have to be willing to accept hate from people if you're going to put your life on display. but being bullied and made fun of for an extremely serious and painful experience that she went through and couldn't control, that's a whole different story. no one deserves that


[06-Dec-20 03:52 PM] lyss#0709
like she's allowed to put her information out there and still be hurt when people cyberbully her for something like that


[06-Dec-20 03:59 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact hey, im just wondering, you said you where leaving in the end of the summer, then you said you where leaving in fall, and now it is winter, so I am just wondering about that

Greetings diorsglare,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as Management from Bloxton Hotels as of 07/12/2020 at 12:00 PM GMT. The reasoning behind your termination is due to sharing malicious IP grabber links, cyber-bullying an individual, and promoting an inappropriate group on the Roblox platform which is in violation of the Roblox Terms of Service. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly.

@everyone 

:bloxton3: **NOTICE OF TERMINATION** :bloxton3: 

Greetings Bloxton MRs,

As part of our agreement to be transparent with terminations, I regret to inform you all that **diorsglare** has been terminated from their position as Management due to sending malicious links, cyber-bullying an individal, and promoting an inappropriate group on the Roblox platform which is in violation of the Roblox Terms of Service.

Due to this, the High-Rank Team has decided to terminate this member from the team.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this termination, feel free to DM a member of the High-Rank Team. Please also remember that you may not leak this termination to any non-MRs as that'd be leaking which can and will result in an instant termination from your position.

[07-Dec-20 09:53 AM] ethan;#0003
And u give us too much time to think about it


[07-Dec-20 09:54 AM] ethan;#0003
Ohh


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
How the people she said


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
Aivan leaked, pzoky is a cb, cheifjohntawwne leaked


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
She said all that


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] Tattoblue#5828
did she even tell u why she thought those things @ethan;


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
No she said she was told


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
Or she knows


[07-Dec-20 09:55 AM] ethan;#0003
Idk how


[07-Dec-20 09:56 AM] ethan;#0003
It was in a VC


[07-Dec-20 09:56 AM] ethan;#0003
A few weeks ago


[07-Dec-20 09:56 AM] ethan;#0003
I said it here nobody payed attention to it


[07-Dec-20 09:56 AM] Tattoblue#5828
idk about pzoky and cheif but we investigated aivdan and didnt find anything so she cud just be making baseless rumours, cheif was brought up a few times before about leaking but we never investigated cheif ü•∏


[07-Dec-20 09:57 AM] ethan;#0003
It was Kylie and Mel who both said it


[07-Dec-20 09:57 AM] ethan;#0003
They where like ‚Äúhow did you not figure out poky is a cb‚Äù


[07-Dec-20 09:57 AM] ethan;#0003
Ik his friends are or used to be friends with cbs


[07-Dec-20 09:57 AM] ethan;#0003
He probs was friends with them also then


[07-Dec-20 09:59 AM] ethan;#0003
I can ask her


[07-Dec-20 09:59 AM] ethan;#0003
For proof


[07-Dec-20 09:59 AM] ethan;#0003
She would give it if she had it


[07-Dec-20 10:03 AM] ethan;#0003
Ok


[07-Dec-20 10:03 AM] ethan;#0003
She said this

Kylie says that he is best friends with her


[07-Dec-20 10:05 AM] ethan;#0003
And what got leaked was stuff said against gotmestarcd


[07-Dec-20 10:06 AM] ethan;#0003
Aivdan also switched discord accounts after@this, to possibly alter evidence

And this is more info backing it up


[07-Dec-20 10:09 AM] stacey#1000
Yes but no real proof to go on anything


[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] stacey#1000

[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] ethan;#0003
We can do it again


[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] ethan;#0003

[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] ethan;#0003
Why he changed discord


[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] ethan;#0003
And still has nitro on his other one


[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] stacey#1000

[07-Dec-20 10:10 AM] stacey#1000

[08-Dec-20 09:16 PM] courtney#5125
she admitted it in the server that she trash-talked in that it was fake


[08-Dec-20 09:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[08-Dec-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
it blocks the date so she cant find the exact dm


[08-Dec-20 09:19 PM] ethan;#0003
the way she says


[08-Dec-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
"anyways"


[08-Dec-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
she doesnt care


[08-Dec-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
she is just faking it


[08-Dec-20 09:21 PM] Tattoblue#5828
lyss typing a whole essay


[08-Dec-20 09:21 PM] lyss#0709
instead of just accepting the consequences and genuinely apologizing, she gets all defensive and throws the blame onto someone else, like girl come on


[08-Dec-20 09:21 PM] lyss#0709
oh


[08-Dec-20 09:21 PM] lyss#0709
no

I can‚Äôt show her that dm of her basically implying that she doesn‚Äôt care right? Since the reporter wants to remain anonymous or

i think we should ask that lr where he got that info from


[08-Dec-20 09:28 PM] lyss#0709
loomsy is a close friend of kylie, mel, liz, and tori so kylie couldve just told them all in their groupchat


[08-Dec-20 09:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
oh i was about to say like what the hell


[08-Dec-20 09:29 PM] katie#0200
Yeah it seems likely


[08-Dec-20 09:29 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i asked her abt it the day i got the report, she said she was only joining in on the spam pinging bc she thought it was supposed to be a joke and she did it bc the kylie and formers were doing it


[08-Dec-20 09:30 PM] katie#0200
great now she‚Äôs asking if/when she can appeal


[08-Dec-20 09:31 PM] Tattoblue#5828
that's always their first question


[08-Dec-20 09:31 PM] Tattoblue#5828
:linustechtips:


[08-Dec-20 09:31 PM] katie#0200
I‚Äôm assuming no appeals? orrr maybe after a few months


[08-Dec-20 09:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
prob be a long time before we even get to it to with this kind of backlog üñêÔ∏è


[08-Dec-20 09:32 PM] ethan;#0003
tell them 12 months


[08-Dec-20 09:33 PM] courtney#5125
i mean maybe we can do something like what boba does with their appeal system. they open it every month i believe, review them all, then close it for another month


[08-Dec-20 09:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
That'd be a good idea

we did


[08-Dec-20 09:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i think


[08-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah theyre all gone @impact

let me find find a blacklist to vote on to make up for that ghost pinh


[08-Dec-20 09:51 PM] impact#0297
@Tattoblue @ethan; curious as to why you'd allow an appeal in a year?


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
people change adventually


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
like dais_ies


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
was perm denied


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
for being a threat to the grou


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
she was banned for over a year


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
she changed


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] lyss#0709
but do cyberbullies and child predators **really** change


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] lyss#0709
she had her chance


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
tru


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] lyss#0709
she chose to waste it by tearing someone down countless times with her friends


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
she will probs forget about it in a year anyways


[08-Dec-20 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
like most people


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003
and we would forget about it also in a year


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] lyss#0709
and tbh her and her little group have probs done this to many people. this just happens to be the only time it was reported


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] impact#0297
i hate to say this but I'm so use to the cyberbullying.. it just doesn't impact me anymore


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] impact#0297
what blows my mind though is the fucking tiktok to recruit kids to become roblox strippers


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003
she asked me like 2 weeks ago if she can work there, i said idc just dont advertise it


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] ethan;#0003
but she advertised it


[08-Dec-20 09:53 PM] impact#0297
if you find yourself an interested prosecutor, that could honestly be trafficking


[08-Dec-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
tried to recruit people to it


[08-Dec-20 09:54 PM] lyss#0709
bye the roblox stripper thing is so creepy


[08-Dec-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
i joined her one time when she was on it


[08-Dec-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
it wasnt what u think it is


[08-Dec-20 09:54 PM] ethan;#0003
its not AS dirty as u think


[08-Dec-20 09:54 PM] Tattoblue#5828
true


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@ethan; there's nothing clean about stripping üíÄ


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
it's not what is dirty and isn't.. it's inevitable to have horny teens..


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
but it's not inevitable to have people advertising to become a roblox stripper


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] lyss#0709
i mean someone told me that the game lets u swear without it tagging


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] lyss#0709
idk how factual that is but


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] impact#0297
there is a reason why that group got banned last time (weird advertising)


[08-Dec-20 09:55 PM] ethan;#0003
did she post it in general chat?


[08-Dec-20 09:56 PM] impact#0297
yes


[08-Dec-20 09:56 PM] impact#0297
she linked her tiktok


[08-Dec-20 09:56 PM] impact#0297
via screenshot


[08-Dec-20 09:56 PM] ethan;#0003
wow


[08-Dec-20 09:56 PM] ethan;#0003
went against what i told her


[08-Dec-20 09:57 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@lyss yeah, the chat in that game looked weird, wouldnt be surprised if it allowed swearing from when i looked at her tik tok apge


[08-Dec-20 09:57 PM] Tattoblue#5828
pagew


[08-Dec-20 09:58 PM] impact#0297
but I think the thing we need to start talking about is how the fuck can we avoid this happening often


[08-Dec-20 09:58 PM] impact#0297
is it inevitable because bloxton is a mature company now?


[08-Dec-20 09:58 PM] impact#0297
is our HR's caring too much about the actions of formers and talkatives instead of focusing on the group??


[08-Dec-20 09:59 PM] impact#0297
why do our formers always seem to be hostile after resignation or termination?


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
nah not all of them


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
only groups of them


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
that was one of the groups


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
they are gone now


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
99% of the time, formers arent toxic alone


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] impact#0297
ok so that raises another question


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] impact#0297
why do they form groups?


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
when they have friends to fuel there fire


[08-Dec-20 10:00 PM] ethan;#0003
idk they where friends when they where mrs and stayed friends


[08-Dec-20 10:01 PM] ethan;#0003
toxicity is inevitable


[08-Dec-20 10:01 PM] ethan;#0003
it will always exist


[08-Dec-20 10:01 PM] ethan;#0003
we can pick the people out, new ones will pop up


[08-Dec-20 10:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053

Hopefully this will change some votes over from the people who wanted to give her the chance in a year.

shes so immature

[09-Dec-20 09:45 AM] lyss#0709
is there anything we can do ab kenzi and amira bc theyre clearly trying to torment lissa and madds. lissa and madds already feel bad enough about this whole situation, and lissa's told me she's this close to resigning bc of everything, so i doubt being mocked in gd by their old friends makes it better

@Tattoblue she was trying to report lissa and madds for what ethan already made an announcement abt. but theres really nothing to report, the mistakes they made were months ago, and lissa didnt leak anything. its obvious kylies only doing it for revenge on her former friends because they reported her wrongdoings

[09-Dec-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
and he does it again


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
so thats why im thinking term for him


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Right I see


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh dang i didnt realize he was fired for that


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Interesado


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
yes he was fired before and we really took awhile just to let him appeal


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@bonnie591 I'm suppose to DM you for proof...


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
yet he does this


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
:broflushed:


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah who knows where the proof is


[09-Dec-20 05:17 PM] courtney#5125
i agree with termination for moody and a 5 day suspension for lane


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] lyss#0709
a suspension for lane and a termination for moody then?


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Blacklist for moody too or what


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes I agree with that @lyss


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
he was blacklisted before so....


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
thats why im bringing it up cause he really should be fired and yes blacklisted again


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can also do a longer suspension for moody if u want to not term but that's up to u dahlings


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
add a vote I guess


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok let's see


[09-Dec-20 05:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah someone do a vote


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
im just saying he was term and blacklisted before


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
given a second chance


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
then does this again so....


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] ethan;#0003
there is a difference from last time he was termed and this occurance


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] lyss#0709
who's doing a vote


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] ethan;#0003
last time it happened in a public chat


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
bonnie is


[09-Dec-20 05:19 PM] ethan;#0003
everyone could see


[09-Dec-20 05:20 PM] ethan;#0003
this time only we know about it and the person who reported it


[09-Dec-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
well obv its not exact same thing as last time


[09-Dec-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
but he still was given a second chance and still does something inappropriate and stupid again


[09-Dec-20 05:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
plus against tos


[09-Dec-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
tbh we've terminated lucas for this exact same thing


[09-Dec-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
so whats stopping us from just terminated lane too


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
terminating*


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
mhm


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] courtney#5125
good point


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
they both very well know its against TOS


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
has lane ever been suspended in past


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] courtney#5125
yeah she was suspended for admin abuse as a head


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
to be doing this in a priv server


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ohh


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
interesting


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
this is like a major major major offence


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
lucas was fired and blacklisted for this no question


[09-Dec-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
no suspension just term for violating TOS


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
lucas?


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] courtney#5125
hes a former manager


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
he was terminated and blacklisted


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] courtney#5125
from several months ago


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
for something very similar to this


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
except i feel like this is worse


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
cause they legit


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] courtney#5125
same punishment for lane or just the termination for her?


[09-Dec-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
built a bed and crap


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
I changed my vote for termination for lane


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
cause


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] ethan;#0003
dont we have suspiciouns that cxjjef is xluvcas


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
ive never heard that before


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Don't term lane


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] lyss#0709
im a bit scared for liv tho bc she was the only one in the game with them so theyll know right away who reported them


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Her first offense


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Not even on a bloxton game


[09-Dec-20 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
no she was suspended before


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] courtney#5125
she was suspended for admin abuse as a head


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
For what


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
this is not her first offence


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
admin abuse

[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Still she wasn't blacklisted for the same type of reason before


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
ok fine suspend lane


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
fire and blacklist moody again


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
then never appeal him again


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] courtney#5125
5 day suspension for lane and fire & blacklist moody


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; oh


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
This isn't in a bloxton game so we can't be too harsh, the only reason we are blacklisting moody is since it's his second offense for same type of reason


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u want


[09-Dec-20 05:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can do 7 day suspension for Lane


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] courtney#5125
thatd probably be better


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u were learning more towards term we can meet in middle


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
ok that works


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Up to 14 days is allowed I believe but more than 5 is rare


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
14 is too much I feel


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
so 7 works


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah i think term and blacklist for moody and suspension for lane is fair


[09-Dec-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
although ill jsut say I wont be suprised if she just resigns


[09-Dec-20 05:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
true


[09-Dec-20 05:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
Fun fact: no matter the offense if a senior used to get suspended it was 14 days automatic


[09-Dec-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
but to terminate a senior


[09-Dec-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
dont we need perms from baby and bear


[09-Dec-20 05:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll dm them


[09-Dec-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
can we get 3 new seniors instead if we are firing one


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] lyss#0709
am i doing both or does someone wanna take one and ill do the other??


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
we lost a lot of seniors recently


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
nicole resigned


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
one is going up to shift


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
and then another one resigned I thought


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
and now one might be getting fired


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] ethan;#0003
dark


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] ethan;#0003
resigned


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
yes 2 resigned


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
now 1 getting fired


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
1 going to shift


[09-Dec-20 05:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
when did dark resign like last week


[09-Dec-20 05:28 PM] stacey#1000
so can we get 3 seniors instead or have another vote in 2 weeks or something


[09-Dec-20 05:28 PM] courtney#5125
i can suspend lane unless someone else really wants to


[09-Dec-20 05:28 PM] lyss#0709
3 seniors 3 senoirs 3 seniors


[09-Dec-20 05:28 PM] lyss#0709
or 30


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
not to mention the seniors we already have that are inactive


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] lyss#0709
can we get like 200 seniors!


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Not 3 new seniors


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] lyss#0709
@courtney ooookayy


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh i feel like we've always had the issue of needing seniors


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can have another vote soon tho


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
that works


[09-Dec-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000

:bloxton3: NOTICE OF TERMINATION :bloxton3:

Greetings Bloxton MRs,

As part of our agreement to be transparent with terminations, I regret to inform you all that moodyqz has been terminated from their position as Senior Management due to **violating ROBLOX TOS and being highly inappropriate.** As you know, we take situations like these very seriously and anyone who violates our expectations will be punished. Due to this, the High-Rank Team has decided to terminate this member from the team.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this termination, feel free to DM a member of the High-Rank Team. Please also remember that you may not leak this termination to any non-MRs as that'd be leaking which can and will result in an instant termination from your position. Have a nice evening everyone.

[09-Dec-20 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
So I do kinda feel bad for moody but it doesn‚Äôt matter what game it‚Äôs on he still violated ROBLOX TOS. If this was really 3 months ago he should‚Äôve reached out to us and informed us about it. Why did liv report it that late tho?


[09-Dec-20 06:45 PM] courtney#5125
do we even know for sure it was that long ago


[09-Dec-20 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
No clue


[09-Dec-20 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
He is just saying that


[09-Dec-20 06:45 PM] courtney#5125
well either way, he violated roblox tos big time and this was his second chance


[09-Dec-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
I get it was 2 years ago he was fired and blacklisted but he was appealed and we almost didn‚Äôt appeal him so he knew he was on thin ice when we appealed him let alone promoted him to mr again


[09-Dec-20 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
If he knew what he did was wrong he should‚Äôve contacted and HR himself and apologize to us


[09-Dec-20 06:47 PM] courtney#5125
and he was appealed after a very short time wasnt he


[09-Dec-20 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn‚Äôt matter it wasn‚Äôt in a Bloxton game him trying to play the ‚Äúthis is not related to Bloxton at all‚Äù card doesn‚Äôt work when you legit violate ROBLOX TOS like that


[09-Dec-20 06:47 PM] courtney#5125
yeah he knew he broke the rules, he admitted it himself. he knew what he did was wrong and chose not to come clean. now he suffers the consequences


[09-Dec-20 06:48 PM] courtney#5125
he didnt just break a bloxton rule, he broke a roblox rule. who cares which game its in


[09-Dec-20 06:48 PM] stacey#1000
He should‚Äôve contacted us and apologize to us directly and not apologize to whoever he did to


[09-Dec-20 06:48 PM] stacey#1000
No matter what game you go on you still represent Bloxton and need to follow general roblox rules


[09-Dec-20 06:48 PM] courtney#5125
if he actually learned from his previous term and blacklist, he shoudlve known what he did was wrong and shouldve known to come clean


[09-Dec-20 06:48 PM] stacey#1000
Like not bypassing in other games etc


[09-Dec-20 06:48 PM] courtney#5125
shouldve*


[09-Dec-20 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
He thinks it‚Äôs not related to it but it is


[09-Dec-20 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
You get blacklisted and term it doesn‚Äôt matter what it‚Äôs for you do something stupid again it comes up


[09-Dec-20 06:57 PM] lyss#0709
yeah welp


[09-Dec-20 06:57 PM] lyss#0709
he


[09-Dec-20 06:57 PM] lyss#0709
refuses to let it go


[09-Dec-20 06:57 PM] lyss#0709
after everything i respond back to him with he starts writing another 10 minute novel


[09-Dec-20 06:57 PM] stacey#1000
What did u tell him


[09-Dec-20 07:00 PM] lyss#0709
the gist of what ive been saying is just that even though it didnt happen in a bloxton related game, it still violates roblox tos which is a bigger deal, and that he shouldve told an hr right when it happened instead of waiting until it was reported


[09-Dec-20 07:01 PM] lyss#0709
and ive basically been repeating myself in every message because i have no idea how else he wants me to get the point across


[09-Dec-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
Yikes


[09-Dec-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
He thinks he can get his rank back by writing paragraphs


[09-Dec-20 07:16 PM] lyss#0709
hes


[09-Dec-20 07:16 PM] lyss#0709
just


[09-Dec-20 07:19 PM] lyss#0709

[09-Dec-20 07:56 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i wouldnt be surprised, he was pretty well liked and respected by a lot of mrs so


[09-Dec-20 08:42 PM] lyss#0709
@stacey moody's asking if he can have the talkative role since he's not able to have the former MR role


[09-Dec-20 08:46 PM] lyss#0709
^ if anyone else wants to answer because i have no idea


[09-Dec-20 09:15 PM] stacey#1000
@lyss I don‚Äôt see why not as long as he doesn‚Äôt cause any drama


[09-Dec-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
He just can‚Äôt get former mr role rn

like when I do ?whois it like gives me two


[09-Dec-20 09:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ig because earlier..it glitched


[09-Dec-20 09:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Welp


[09-Dec-20 09:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
dyno is now saying stuff twice.


[09-Dec-20 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
Well yep someone leaked all the formers and stuff know about why moody was terminated but they legit know it was because of the thing moody and lane did so I think either lane or moody told them


[09-Dec-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
Cause that was not in the announcement


[09-Dec-20 09:41 PM] courtney#5125
i just dont think it was lane, she handled the suspension super well


[09-Dec-20 09:41 PM] courtney#5125
she said she understood why she was being suspended, she thanked me for letting her know


[09-Dec-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
She probably still told her friends


[09-Dec-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
Cause somehowEmma knows the exact reason and she said the formers told her


[09-Dec-20 09:42 PM] courtney#5125
i just feel like itd be something moody did


[09-Dec-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
Like that lane and moody were inappropriate


[09-Dec-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
And now some people want him banned from the discord


[09-Dec-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
I mean he is blacklisted but that‚Äôs not the discord server


[09-Dec-20 09:42 PM] lyss#0709
vedom accused hai1eqy (head of services) of telling him moody was terminated, but the person who sent me this screenshot hasnt been able to convince vedom to give more information

[10-Dec-20 06:59 AM] ethan;#0003
i asked him in vc if people applying for dhs need to unfriend crims


[10-Dec-20 06:59 AM] Polk#1596
and almost all of DHS has criminal friends


[10-Dec-20 06:59 AM] ethan;#0003
he said it doesnt matter because he will still know


[10-Dec-20 07:00 AM] Polk#1596

yup ripp


[10-Dec-20 12:19 PM] lyss#0709
do you guys think we should have a staff announcement on reporting incidents right away instead of waiting so long, because that's what's happened in the last 2 termination cases. with the situation regarding kylie, instead of reporting the ip grabbing right away, the reporters waited months until they reported that and the bullying. and with moody (and lane's) situation, it supposedly happened a couple months ago (while i don't believe there is solid proof of that) but was just reported yesterday


[10-Dec-20 12:20 PM] lyss#0709
and even though people could still struggle with reporting things right away, especially if it involves their friends, it could still potentially be worth a shot to at least say something to the MRs


[10-Dec-20 12:27 PM] courtney#5125
i dont think an announcement could hurt. a lot of mrs think its perfectly fine to report things months and weeks after the event happened, and they think its okay to report something that happened a while ago just after the person gets promoted, or after they get into a fight


[10-Dec-20 01:00 PM] bonnie591#0591

he was fired and now hes just making excuses abt it and trying to play victim to everyone

He also said that she made a server to talk about all what happened or something.


[10-Dec-20 11:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And made tea docs and sent them to mirk

wouldn't put it past her


[11-Dec-20 01:17 AM] courtney#5125
@KjRBLX that‚Äôd make a lot of sense. that user was causing drama in general discussion by trying to blame lissa for a bunch of things, and then she dmed me evidence of lissa, the same evidence that kylie sent to Ethan


[11-Dec-20 01:22 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Believe mirk said kylie told him in vc so he doesn‚Äôt have any visible proof

[11-Dec-20 06:53 PM] stacey#1000
She even still bugs me when I go inactive for 1 week


[11-Dec-20 06:54 PM] stacey#1000
Hopefully she stops

Trello needs to add a frequently used


[11-Dec-20 06:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
when your gonna transfer a card between list on 1 board


[11-Dec-20 06:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it shows u list u often move cards too


[11-Dec-20 06:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but if ur transferring to a whole different list on another board


[11-Dec-20 06:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it doesn't give u a recommendation


[11-Dec-20 06:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
so u gotta select the board and the list

[12-Dec-20 08:23 AM] stacey#1000
It bugs me that imag still chose to dm me even when my status was legit DMs closed inactive. She didn‚Äôt remind me for bans or anything but still chose to dm me to complain about stuff


[12-Dec-20 08:24 AM] stacey#1000
I go inactive for only a week and a half and people are thinking I got fired or some crap. Like oml let me be inactive for a week people can survive. It‚Äôs greattt


[12-Dec-20 08:24 AM] stacey#1000
People think I got fired or I resigned


[12-Dec-20 08:39 AM] KjRBLX#2053
She won‚Äôt stop because she knows we aren‚Äôt busy?


[12-Dec-20 08:39 AM] KjRBLX#2053
She forget some people are preparing for exams?


[12-Dec-20 10:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
If imag doesn't come to the ban session then ima laugh


[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] katie#0200

[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] katie#0200

[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] katie#0200
wont*


[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] katie#0200
every time she comes to mine she manages to do like 10 cards then says she has to leave bc shes lagging too much


[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] katie#0200
then tells me just not to put her down for attendance bc she didnt do much


[12-Dec-20 10:03 AM] courtney#5125
so she wants to force the hrs to do all that but when she‚Äôs actually given the chance to help out with one of her complaints, she somehow can‚Äôt do it


[12-Dec-20 10:03 AM] bonnie591#0591
Honestly if her incompetence continues in general then we can look to take action


[12-Dec-20 10:08 AM] stacey#1000
She also has DMed me a bunch of people she thinks is inactive


[12-Dec-20 10:08 AM] stacey#1000
Like heads and stuff


[12-Dec-20 10:09 AM] stacey#1000
I told her I could look into it and if she wanted to do that it‚Äôs her choice but i don‚Äôt see why she needed to look into who she thinks was inactive.....


[12-Dec-20 10:09 AM] bonnie591#0591
its not even her job smh


[12-Dec-20 10:09 AM] bonnie591#0591
honestly can we fire her for incompetence and harassment


[12-Dec-20 10:09 AM] stacey#1000
Let me get evidence of this


[12-Dec-20 10:09 AM] bonnie591#0591
we should collect evidence


[12-Dec-20 10:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
dont take action now but like in future we should consider


[12-Dec-20 10:10 AM] bonnie591#0591

ty to tatto for idea

ill do a ticket session in like 20-30 minutes


[13-Dec-20 01:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
this person..


[13-Dec-20 01:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Why not just remove her ban, then once she gives us the information we need..ban her


[13-Dec-20 01:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
that makes us look bad


[13-Dec-20 01:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
and it also breaks any and all trust with her


[13-Dec-20 01:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we need her again in the future for investigations


[13-Dec-20 01:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
if she violates rules once she rejoins, then she can be perm banned though


[13-Dec-20 01:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Who is this kelly anyway?


[13-Dec-20 01:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
she's a former MR who seems to know a lot about people


[13-Dec-20 01:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
she's been involved in quite a few investigations in the past


[13-Dec-20 01:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
if she's friends with the leaker on discord


[13-Dec-20 01:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and if you're friends with them too


[13-Dec-20 01:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Mutual friends list

if that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs referencing... that‚Äôs extremely rude wtf

im assuming she's talking about liv since liv was the one who reported moody and lane


[13-Dec-20 04:29 PM] lyss#0709
and she's thinking liv was only promoted to "fill" moody's spot

oh and all three of them used to be friends as well

she needs to be spoken to about that or something... that‚Äôs very disrespectful and it‚Äôs also able for all of the public to see since it‚Äôs in her status and she‚Äôs online


[13-Dec-20 04:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[14-Dec-20 10:09 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah....maybe we should‚Äôve fired lane


[14-Dec-20 10:10 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm legit worried she‚Äôs just going to leak to people at this point when she is unsuspended. She has nothing to lose


[14-Dec-20 10:10 AM] stacey#1000
And she is not taking her suspension very mature at all either


[14-Dec-20 10:11 AM] stacey#1000
@lyss I would announce that tbh because we should either make her suspension longer or consider terminating her at this point


[14-Dec-20 10:12 AM] lyss#0709
alright, and yeah i would agree


[14-Dec-20 10:21 AM] Fraux#7971
@lyss ya i said something should‚Äôve been done  or something whenever I saw u sent the status yesterday


[14-Dec-20 10:25 AM] lyss#0709
oh yesyes i see that


[14-Dec-20 10:29 AM] Fraux#7971
I think she needs to be terminated also.. she should‚Äôve gotten fired along with moody. I understand moody had appealed in 2018, but that was 2 years ago and it‚Äôs in the past so I believe lane should be because of that first doc of proof, but now these screenshots. Idk tho tell me what y‚Äôall feel


[14-Dec-20 10:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
Sounds like shes gonna be a threat if she comes back to the MR team


[14-Dec-20 10:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
Her suspension is also supposed to be that time where she learns to improve, not trash others


[14-Dec-20 10:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
We dont need people like that on the MR team so I say terminate


[14-Dec-20 10:30 AM] Polk#1596
i have no objections for a termination, disgusting behavior


[14-Dec-20 10:30 AM] lyss#0709
i agree, she's really shown her true colors


[14-Dec-20 10:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
U have 2 bod approval so if u guys want to terminate u can go ahead


[14-Dec-20 10:31 AM] xM_inn#2821

r we terming for that or just for the trash talking rn


[14-Dec-20 10:34 AM] Polk#1596
you can include all the other reasons as well, as the toxicity is what pushed her over the line

Greetings **lanegorl**,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as **Management** from Bloxton Hotels as of **December 14, 2020; 10:xx AM**. The reasoning behind your termination is due to **violating Roblox TOS, trash talking fellow staff, and overall toxicity**. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

**Fraux**
**Shift Manager**

she wants to see the proof


[14-Dec-20 10:50 AM] Fraux#7971
it would seem the proof would give away the reporter


[14-Dec-20 10:51 AM] lyss#0709
sierra said they weren't her screenshots but didn't tell me whose they were, so it could technically be from anyone in their server


[14-Dec-20 10:52 AM] Fraux#7971
Ohhh i see


[14-Dec-20 10:52 AM] Fraux#7971
she knows what she did tho


[14-Dec-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah if she got her rank back she would‚Äôve leaked legit


[14-Dec-20 12:10 PM] stacey#1000
She really thinks livs promotion was based off of her report she should know how it works by now. Glad she‚Äôs gone

We had some mugs for sale, but we took them off sale unfortunately because the design print came out blurry when the samples arrived :(
So @Beartikal decided it was a good idea to pay respects and drink some hot chocolate out of the flawed mug

Thanks #DevEx for the Christmas gift.

I finally got my dream car - a Tesla! A 2021 Tesla model 3 long range!

A big thank to you all for supporting my games and #RobloxUGC! Alongside @Roblox for making this possible too for its creators!

And thank you mom taking this picture!

honestly tesla's are nice and all but I feel like it's not worth it for a college student


[16-Dec-20 09:22 PM] impact#0297
like save up your money for a nice house.. something that appreciates in value instead of depreciates (such as a car)


[16-Dec-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
teslas actually dont depreciate much, the used ones are pretty expensive still and its better to just buy new


[16-Dec-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
this is because no matter how old the car they still get all the software updates and their driving capability gets better


[16-Dec-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
its crazy


[16-Dec-20 09:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Like a single update can give you 5% more range

@impact obviously they depreciate but it's less than your traditional automobile, just the way it is with the Tesla Resell market


[17-Dec-20 05:18 AM] babymariobebe#7563
You're better off buying a new over used tesla

So from December 21st-January 4th? Or can they be excused the rest of this week too


[17-Dec-20 06:00 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn


[17-Dec-20 06:00 PM] impact#0297
Excuse till 11th. Most schools have changed timing to allow more time at home (or maybe it's just me)


[17-Dec-20 06:00 PM] stacey#1000
I go back on the 11th


[17-Dec-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
If we give them to the 11th, give them their requirements for this week


[17-Dec-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Then they get a solid 3 weeks


[17-Dec-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Nice and simple


[17-Dec-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
Ok so December 21st to January 11th


[17-Dec-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ye


[17-Dec-20 06:01 PM] stacey#1000
Good perfect

San Valentia, SR
Check out San Valentia, SR. It‚Äôs one of the millions of unique, user-generated 3D experiences created on Roblox. We're currently in the process of moving the game to a group place in order to streamline everything. Stay tuned!

Second release of this map so far, fully revamped to suffice for San Valentia. Expect bugs and glitches as usual, along...

[18-Dec-20 01:06 AM] Polk#1596
Yes, we usually excuse them for activity that week


[18-Dec-20 08:41 AM] Polk#1596
i think all those things are cool except the session ping thing @bonnie591


[18-Dec-20 08:41 AM] Polk#1596
we are doomed to lose members, even if it is a "click to get" role


[18-Dec-20 08:41 AM] Polk#1596
the training schedule is 1 click away and people can put reminders for the session cards already


[18-Dec-20 08:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah true


[18-Dec-20 08:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
would you object to a channel where it displays it but doesnt ping


[18-Dec-20 08:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
@Polk


[18-Dec-20 08:43 AM] Polk#1596
thats better


[18-Dec-20 08:43 AM] Polk#1596
but i already know baby doesnt want too many channels


[18-Dec-20 08:43 AM] Polk#1596
@bonnie591


[18-Dec-20 08:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah ill speak to him before i implement this


[18-Dec-20 08:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
just seeing what y'all approve first


[18-Dec-20 08:44 AM] Polk#1596
OK NVM, he said he doesnt want too many roles


[18-Dec-20 08:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
how to have too many channels


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
step 1: tickets


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] Polk#1596
obviously i cant prevent myself from seeing all of the 482394329889 channels we have


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] Polk#1596
but if i were to be a server member


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] Polk#1596
or own the server myself


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] Polk#1596
i would want to have as few channels as possible


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] Polk#1596
visible


[18-Dec-20 08:45 AM] Polk#1596
as long as it doesnt ping people i guess im ok with it though


[18-Dec-20 08:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
yes sir!


[18-Dec-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
How does the bot add cards to the board for ban request? @bonnie591


[18-Dec-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
Does it connect to their trello acc?


[18-Dec-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
So it would say their acc is still adding the card


[18-Dec-20 08:57 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm just about like their accounts being compromised or like if it‚Äôs easy for people to hack the bot to mess up the board


[18-Dec-20 08:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
yes, at the minute it connects to lees account but we'd make a new account for the trello so its not just lees account adding it. we can make it say who added it in the description of the card


[18-Dec-20 08:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah but all they can do is add ban requests and i think they'd target leaking


[18-Dec-20 08:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
we already have that concern cuz what if someone trello got hacked


[18-Dec-20 08:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
they could destory the whole board


[18-Dec-20 08:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
this only lets them add suspension and ban requests


[18-Dec-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
Do we have a backup board in case anyone ever does mess up the board


[18-Dec-20 08:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
i can make one


[18-Dec-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
Cause it‚Äôs happened to fs before


[18-Dec-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
We should have a backup management and senior board tbh


[18-Dec-20 08:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
now we do


[18-Dec-20 08:59 AM] stacey#1000
Just in case cause you never know


[18-Dec-20 08:59 AM] stacey#1000
HR board idk


[18-Dec-20 08:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill back hr too


[18-Dec-20 08:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
management senior and hr are our main boards


[18-Dec-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
We might never need it but like if anyone‚Äôs acc ever did get hacked and someone messed up the boards


[18-Dec-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs there


[18-Dec-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Trello doesn‚Äôt have 2FA


[18-Dec-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
When they should


[18-Dec-20 09:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok all backed up


[18-Dec-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
Good


[18-Dec-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
Also what are these channels for

If we don‚Äôt use them anymore


[18-Dec-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
Why they still there


[18-Dec-20 09:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
its an archive


[18-Dec-20 09:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
just if we ever need them


[18-Dec-20 09:22 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I believe trello has 2fa now, seen it before i believe


[18-Dec-20 09:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Yep they do cuz i have it enabled


[18-Dec-20 09:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
as long as its safe and isnt gonna cause threat or anything then sure


[18-Dec-20 09:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
cool idea


[18-Dec-20 09:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
Idk about the ban request & suspension request thing as I feel that could be quite confusing, but the MR call and session announcement seems cool


[18-Dec-20 09:48 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk about ban request and sus


[18-Dec-20 09:48 AM] KjRBLX#2053
If lee leaves we would most likely remove part of the bots features


[18-Dec-20 09:48 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Like the ban request and sus


[18-Dec-20 09:49 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Cuz we cant just leave it because he could possibly still have access to the api key and token


[18-Dec-20 10:03 AM] bonnie591#0591
If lee leaves we might have to revert or just find another bot


[18-Dec-20 10:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
But for now it would be good

the one with the person asking the same questions in questions


[18-Dec-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
@anna when ur doing talkative tickets u dont need to wait for the person to respond if they dont meet the age requirement,  u can just close it, they should be reading the rules


[18-Dec-20 08:53 PM] cory!#8287
‚ÄúReporting the user, askvovia for suspected trolling and a huge lack of knowledge on their position which I believe should be a termination as they're asking questions which would usually result in fail at trainings. I've taken some previous evidence of the questions asked as well. Someone stated they reported it already but I'm not too sure if they actually have or not, so I shall report it too.‚Äù


[18-Dec-20 08:53 PM] cory!#8287
from the user^


[18-Dec-20 08:54 PM] impact#0297
Yea, the premise of the ticket was that an MR is underage because he/she does not have knowledge of the position -- I think it only has weight because a management dropped that.


[18-Dec-20 08:54 PM] impact#0297
Just leave it there. I'll bring it up in the meeting tomorrow quickly.

@cory! likely going to promote ModernWorld today around 4 or 5 est. I seen him at the hotel around those times so hopefully he‚Äôs on


[19-Dec-20 07:52 AM] stacey#1000
And you can observe to see how promotions work


[19-Dec-20 07:52 AM] stacey#1000
Then if you feel comfortable with it you can promote j2iden and I can assist you with it but you don‚Äôt have to


[19-Dec-20 07:53 AM] cory!#8287
okay


[19-Dec-20 07:54 AM] cory!#8287
you just have to have like information about their rank for the promotion guides right? Like admin commands to not use, information about the discord trainings and interviews, etc


[19-Dec-20 08:04 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I can send you my guides


[19-Dec-20 08:04 AM] stacey#1000
You just copy and paste it for them and answer any questions they have. Then rank them and update them in discord server


[19-Dec-20 08:05 AM] stacey#1000
When I promote ModernWorId I‚Äôll add you to a group chat so you can see me do rules with him


[19-Dec-20 08:35 AM] cory!#8287
alright ty


[19-Dec-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
@lyss your trainings is going to overlap with my banning session I‚Äôve had planned for a couple days jsyk


[19-Dec-20 10:03 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs at the exact same time


[19-Dec-20 10:04 AM] stacey#1000
So you might be low on seniors


[19-Dec-20 10:11 AM] lyss#0709
oh


[19-Dec-20 10:11 AM] lyss#0709
im just gonna move it to tomorrow


[19-Dec-20 10:11 AM] stacey#1000
Theme session preparation will be happening at that time tomorrow


[19-Dec-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
You can host a server for the session I have later if you would like!


[19-Dec-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
Or you can just take my training if you want


[19-Dec-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
The one at 6


[19-Dec-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
And I can do one at 8


[19-Dec-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
So you can still do one


[19-Dec-20 10:14 AM] lyss#0709
nono thats ok you can keep your sessions bc ill probs be eating at that time anyways, ill change it to 9:30 am cst so it wont interfere with building

Oki

[19-Dec-20 10:15 AM] lyss#0709
thats ok!! i didnt realize u had a banning session when i added it yesterday


[19-Dec-20 10:15 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs all good!


[19-Dec-20 10:24 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I would remove her former role and possibly ban her from the discord. For sure a start with no former role.


[19-Dec-20 10:24 AM] Tattoblue#5828
^


[19-Dec-20 10:24 AM] stacey#1000
She shouldn‚Äôt be having that role with that behaviour. Having it is a privilege and if you chose to be toxic you cannot have the role


[19-Dec-20 10:25 AM] cory!#8287
agreed ^


[19-Dec-20 10:25 AM] cory!#8287
if I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt have given it to her


[19-Dec-20 10:25 AM] stacey#1000
@katie did she do anything in the discord or only DMs


[19-Dec-20 10:26 AM] katie#0200
That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been notified of, I think all that‚Äôs happened has been in DMs/gcs


[19-Dec-20 10:30 AM] stacey#1000
Oh


[19-Dec-20 10:31 AM] stacey#1000

[19-Dec-20 02:10 PM] katie#0200
Yeah I noticed it too


[19-Dec-20 02:10 PM] ethan;#0003
we are the only group that does this with talkative tickets


[19-Dec-20 02:11 PM] ethan;#0003
so we can get designated discord mods


[19-Dec-20 02:11 PM] ethan;#0003
a lot of groups have that


[19-Dec-20 02:11 PM] katie#0200
I think it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try, maybe trial it?


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] ethan;#0003
Groups have designated game mods, and designated discord mods and also MR's who can do both


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] courtney#5125
ya maybe a trial


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
so you're suggesting a moderator team, not only consisting of MRs?


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] ethan;#0003
it can start with just MR's


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] courtney#5125
idk abt game mods, but maybe disc mods


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] ethan;#0003
and then maybe trusted formers


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] katie#0200
Yeah just disc mods


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] Polk#1596
i think its doable if we take small steps


[19-Dec-20 02:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean there are a lot of Mrs who moderate the discord server already so maybe that wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try it?


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont think we need discord mods but we can get rid of talkative


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] ethan;#0003
We can give them dyno mod so they can mute people


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] ethan;#0003
not kick people


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
that would be the ideal thing


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont think i can do that with bloxlink but id have to check


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
if the process could be automated


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] katie#0200
The thing is management have all the power they need to moderate at the moment, it‚Äôs just that seniors+ are needed for banning which isn‚Äôt an issue as there‚Äôs always one available


[19-Dec-20 02:13 PM] Polk#1596
is this something lee can do? @bonnie591


[19-Dec-20 02:14 PM] Polk#1596
a bot that checks roblox account age and discord account age for us


[19-Dec-20 02:14 PM] ethan;#0003
its becus nobody likes talkative tickets


[19-Dec-20 02:14 PM] ethan;#0003
waste of time


[19-Dec-20 02:14 PM] Polk#1596
essentially doing the job for us


[19-Dec-20 02:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we chose to use lees verification bot that could work as he can do a lot


[19-Dec-20 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah ill need to look into it first


[19-Dec-20 02:15 PM] ethan;#0003
lee can make it custom just for the bloxton server


[19-Dec-20 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
see what i can do


[19-Dec-20 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
ya that sounds good


[19-Dec-20 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591

so hes sent me an appeal thing explaining his point of view, you can take a read through it but tbh it was kinda rushed the decision and yeah the former mrs hated him and stuff. ill let you read the doc and then we can talk about if we want to unban, not unban or probation etc  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_j1hK0ZfsMMLeJb5qPyEaFcZDnlrQUiFAkcIw8RSSKI/edit?usp=sharing

he just wants to interact with the discord server, not get unblacklisted or anything


[19-Dec-20 02:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
so i thought if we were going to unban


[19-Dec-20 02:17 PM] katie#0200
I‚Äôve read it already he sent it to me a few days ago, tbh his reasoning looks legit and I think we should consider the former mrs‚Äô influence on the decision


[19-Dec-20 02:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
how about like we give him a probation thing where he cannot get any warnings and can only access certain roles like verified and talkative only


[19-Dec-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
I HEARD "HOSTAGE SITUATION"


[19-Dec-20 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah they will erupt and everything, its a tricky decision


[19-Dec-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
hell yea full auto in the building lets go


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] Polk#1596
ok i read that and it seems fair how it was all an accident


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] Polk#1596
but it would cause drama 100% if we let him back in üò¨


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
i mean flyro did make a mistake and everyone makes mistakes so we should allow him back. we do appeal people so formers just have to accept taht


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
that


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] Polk#1596
how many times has this happened to him


[19-Dec-20 02:21 PM] Polk#1596
blacklist, ban


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] ethan;#0003
flyro was banned for pedophilia


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] Polk#1596
oh ik what you're talking about cyto


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
flyro has been banned and blacklisted loads of times which does kinda incur no appeals but idk


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
how many chances do we give him?


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] Polk#1596
it was between him and the first guy i ever promoted


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] katie#0200
nathan?


[19-Dec-20 02:22 PM] Polk#1596
thats what i was gonna say bonnie, i dont think we can give him any more second chances


[19-Dec-20 02:23 PM] Polk#1596
yea nathan


[19-Dec-20 02:23 PM] katie#0200
ah yeah I remember that


[19-Dec-20 02:24 PM] Polk#1596
well i dont have any additional thoughts on it tbh


[19-Dec-20 02:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah we could do that


[19-Dec-20 02:24 PM] Polk#1596
so sure


[19-Dec-20 02:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
so another thing


[19-Dec-20 02:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
sowbex dmed me yesterday regarding cbs and i kinda agree with what they said, take a read: https://gyazo.com/305d5c61b66216f4264a4797067cfa1c

[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
like


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] courtney#5125
yeah the whole concept of cbs is super pointless rn


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
they arent even doing any harm


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
so why should we accept proof for a ban for that


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] ethan;#0003
just call cbs trollers


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] Polk#1596
we have like removed and added the term "cb" back and fourth countless of times


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they do something wrong, just ban them for what they did


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] lyss#0709
i agree, they should be treated as trollers until they commit a major offense


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] katie#0200
I agree


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] ethan;#0003
just call them a troller


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] courtney#5125
and theres just wayyy too many and they only do it bc they have a label and they have the attention for it


[19-Dec-20 02:26 PM] ethan;#0003
instead fo a cb


[19-Dec-20 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they dance around the hotel because they have a cb name, dont ban. if they do start to troll follow warning system


[19-Dec-20 02:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
if we get rid of CBs itll also get rid of a lot of confusion and questions


[19-Dec-20 02:27 PM] courtney#5125
yeah if they troll, then we warn them. if they commit a major offense, then theyre kicked and banned


[19-Dec-20 02:27 PM] lyss#0709
if we take away the label, it takes away their power


[19-Dec-20 02:27 PM] courtney#5125
^


[19-Dec-20 02:28 PM] Polk#1596
i dont remember what problems we got last time but it was apparently enough to add it back


[19-Dec-20 02:28 PM] katie#0200
It was crazy when we removed it before but I think we can try it again


[19-Dec-20 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
i wish we could have an admin command that can silence them for everyone but they wont know themselves if they were silence so they could go around spamming while causing no harm


[19-Dec-20 02:29 PM] ethan;#0003
also we need to let seniors pban


[19-Dec-20 02:29 PM] courtney#5125
but theres also so many heads that are really good friends with cbs


[19-Dec-20 02:29 PM] ethan;#0003
not just server ban


[19-Dec-20 02:29 PM] courtney#5125
so the word would get out to cbs pretty fast


[19-Dec-20 02:30 PM] katie#0200
It would definitely be more beneficial to get the MRs‚Äô opinions


[19-Dec-20 02:30 PM] lyss#0709
yeah it should be talked about with all mrs, not just managers+


[19-Dec-20 02:30 PM] anna#0004
ya i agree with that


[19-Dec-20 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
tbh im interested to find out what happened if we just got all the staff to ignore cbs and give them no attention at all but that would destroy the hotel


[19-Dec-20 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
cant we just let seniors pban


[19-Dec-20 02:30 PM] courtney#5125
we've already shot down the idea of seniors being able to pban time and time again


[19-Dec-20 02:31 PM] courtney#5125
with good reason


[19-Dec-20 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
do we not trust them??


[19-Dec-20 02:31 PM] courtney#5125
we trust them, hence why we let them server ban


[19-Dec-20 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
they cant host


[19-Dec-20 02:31 PM] Polk#1596
i think we added it back so the MRs could instantly get rid of the cbs because they kept harassing our MRs, but if it would benefit the mrs by removing it again, then im all for it. it causes some issues and removes some issues at the same time, so


[19-Dec-20 02:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
id love like a ban command via this discord


[19-Dec-20 02:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
or a request channel where we can just react to a message and it bans them


[19-Dec-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact has rds became more trustworthy?


[19-Dec-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
then it was 4 years ago


[19-Dec-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003

[19-Dec-20 02:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Rds is out of business


[19-Dec-20 02:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
also cyto whats ur opinion on this https://discord.com/channels/325865347045523456/698763137607925855/789500297621930034


[19-Dec-20 02:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They went out of business mostly likely due to roblox not allowing non public module scripts to be required off the marketplace


[19-Dec-20 02:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah im gonna talk about all of them to baby


[19-Dec-20 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact if we harass him till he responds he will respond


[19-Dec-20 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
what if we make him join vc rn


[19-Dec-20 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
he is online


[19-Dec-20 02:36 PM] impact#0297
@babymariobebe can you provide an update on the paying system


[19-Dec-20 02:36 PM] katie#0200

[19-Dec-20 02:36 PM] impact#0297

[19-Dec-20 02:39 PM] emily#4444
a while ago there was a doc from an mr about seniors pms being too strict but i dont think anything was done about that, maybe an announcement or something would be good !


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] emily#4444
idk all of their pms but ik imag is one


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
I know some of the seniors that did that resigned


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] lyss#0709
yea like moody and dark had long pms but they're gone


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] ethan;#0003
she is incompetent


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] Polk#1596
wdym senior pms being too strict


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] ethan;#0003

[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I wanna see what strict looks like from them


[19-Dec-20 02:40 PM] ethan;#0003

[19-Dec-20 02:41 PM] Polk#1596
i have "if you fail to comply with this PM you will get warned" included in my pm


[19-Dec-20 02:41 PM] Polk#1596
which is to be fair just a friendly reminder because we tell them to read or pms... or else


[19-Dec-20 02:41 PM] Polk#1596
so idk what could be more threatening than that

pm admins Interviewers, you are to interview 3-4 interviewees at a time. If you are one of the people taking only 3 interviewees, you must ensure the lobby is clear before starting the interview. Once done interviewing, please teleport the passers and line them up in front of me. Keep in mind that sharing is not allowed under any circumstances! If there are no offices left, please use the lobby. Also, you are not allowed to leave without telling me. Please note that failure to comply with this PM will result in a written warning. You may begin interviewing! Everyone has now been granted permission to DJ as well. Good luck! :D

[19-Dec-20 02:43 PM] lyss#0709
my pms are like 2 sentences long


[19-Dec-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
i dont see the issue with stating a lot of information in a pm


[19-Dec-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
it prevents misunderstandings


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
same lool


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] Polk#1596
whats more threatening, knowing everything you need to know or doing something wrong and getting punished for it?


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
At most at a time ill send is 3 pms but they‚Äôre kinda short


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But i send them before we go to the next task


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
Ive spoken to one senior about pms


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So they read then they start


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] lyss#0709
i would never want to read that long of pms if i was a manager


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
and they still do it


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] Polk#1596
if we dont tell them they will literally ask us questions about it every session


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] Polk#1596
one time


[19-Dec-20 02:44 PM] lyss#0709
and some have like, the most unnecessary information


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah I try to make mine short a simple.


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
Pm admins DJ and supervise please. You can unlock for anyone that loses connection as the server will be slock 11 in case anyone loses connection.


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
thats my pms


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] Polk#1596
someone shared without asking me and i had to yell at them, so i added that part into my pm so it wont happen again :shrug:


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] lyss#0709
like managers know that they need to check trainees and stuff, that doesnt need to be mentioned


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
and other seniors tell me mine is short and boring


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] courtney#5125
you can still give all of the necessary information in a sentence or two


[19-Dec-20 02:45 PM] courtney#5125
managers arent stupid, they know how a session works


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] courtney#5125
they dont need to be walked through it every step of the way


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
thats not possible if you have to tell them 5 things though


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
so just make an announcement to seniors


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
easy fix


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
if you're referring to my pm


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
whos making the announcement


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] lyss#0709
i think things that can be interchangeable depending on the host should be included, such as if managers are allowed to unslock, but things that are constant no matter the host, like supervising and checking trainees, thats not necessary


[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] ethan;#0003

[19-Dec-20 02:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

its literally


[19-Dec-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
i hate APPEALS

[19-Dec-20 02:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
so fucking long to do one appeal


[19-Dec-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
I got an idea of how to do appeals better


[19-Dec-20 02:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
no one likes doing appeals either

tbh i havent done a single appeal since getting hr, its way too confusing to me


[19-Dec-20 02:47 PM] ethan;#0003
id rather play firestone then do appeals :)


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
i havent done appeals ever since the new thing was brought out


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I liked what candy said couple weeks ago about doing something like boba


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
but what about new mrs not knowing what to do?


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] ethan;#0003
EXCEL IS DOG CRAP I HATE IT SO MUCH I WANT TO KILL WHO CREATED IT


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
we could create a rule/regulations handbook


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] Polk#1596
but it takes time


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
id rather watch 10 hour green screen on youtube


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I do appeals with a status process of the appeal


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like ill read then log later


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But in the results ill color code to know where to look


[19-Dec-20 02:48 PM] anna#0004
yeah i agree, it was easier that way


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] ethan;#0003
apppeals are :vomit:


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
the accepted and decline message is cringe


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] ethan;#0003
:AVomitingFace:


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] ethan;#0003
WHAT I THINK OF THE CURRENT APPEAL METHOD


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] lyss#0709
but when we have new managers, they learn through the rules theyre given that they have to supervise and check trainees at training. that doesnt need to be mentioned, whereas things like if they can unslock for ppl or what to do if they need to leave early, thats fine if a host includes that in their pms


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I stopped sending the letters, i just be like u failed and this what u needa do better on


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] Polk#1596
i was talking about new mrs


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] Polk#1596
not new managers


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] Polk#1596
for interviews


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could make it easier for managers and use the lee bot thing so they just have to do a command :Thonk:


[19-Dec-20 02:49 PM] lyss#0709
same for mrs in general tho


[19-Dec-20 02:50 PM] Polk#1596
but sure, i get what you mean


[19-Dec-20 02:50 PM] lyss#0709
they learn the big things in rules


[19-Dec-20 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah we could do board


[19-Dec-20 02:51 PM] anna#0004
i wouldnt mind another board


[19-Dec-20 02:51 PM] lyss#0709
^


[19-Dec-20 02:52 PM] courtney#5125
yeah itd be worth it to have another board


[19-Dec-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596

[19-Dec-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596

[19-Dec-20 02:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
yea


[19-Dec-20 02:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don‚Äôt mind another one


[19-Dec-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
we can like use the lee bot as well like we have the idea for the ban and suspension request thing


[19-Dec-20 02:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Hi all! Hope you‚Äôre well.  This past week, I‚Äôve launched my new flagship application centre software called Hyra. The concept of the platform was founded from the lack of quality, well-structured free application centres. The project has taken about 6 months to get fully complete, and has already got over 2,500 registered users in the first week...

hm


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
well u know what we could do to start with


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
allow trainees to talk without needing talkative


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
then if that goes well


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
open it up to everyone else


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] Polk#1596
thats a good idea


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] ethan;#0003
there is not enough trainees to get a good view of it


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] ethan;#0003
to see enough change, there isnt enough trainees


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] Polk#1596
we can just take small steps regardless


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah we can announce it


[19-Dec-20 03:03 PM] ethan;#0003
enough trainees who are in the discord, actively tryin got verify


[19-Dec-20 03:04 PM] Polk#1596

[19-Dec-20 03:04 PM] bonnie591#0591

Upcoming Management+ Meeting 

Greetings managers and seniors,

It has been awhile since we have had a meeting with you. Next Sunday, December 27th at 3:00 PM EST the HR team will be having a meeting with you to discuss rules and regulations, and other topics. This is also a good opportunity for you to bring up concerns you may have that you would like to see changed. If you have any topics you would like to be discussed, please DM me and I can add it to the list. 

Please know that leaking this meeting to any heads or LRs will result in consequences. We will likely have another meeting with heads and all MRs another time. For now, the HR team feels it‚Äôs best to have a meeting with just management+ for now as you have a lot more responsibilities and different things to discuss. This is a good opportunity for you to bring any concerns you have to the table. Don‚Äôt be afraid to dm me any topics. If you cannot attend the meeting, notes will be made and released after the meeting most likely. Have a good holidays and we hope to see you at the meeting next week! 

Best regards,
staceyvx 
General Manager 
Bloxton Hotels.

Greetings, @MRTeam! 

This is just a quick reminder to you all about discussions in the MR Team Chat at the Hotel. 

Yes, this chat is a way in which you can communicate with one another without using grammar etc, however you still need to be wary of what topics you are discussing. There is an exploit which allows access to see the Team Chats through chatlogs so to prevent any private information getting out, we could use this chat in a way that is more relevant to your duties. For example, instead of PMing ‚ÄúHey, did you kick so and so for three warnings already?‚Äù you can just head to the Team Chat and ask. That is just an example of what you could be discussing, but if you‚Äôre discussing private topics then just be aware that this isn‚Äôt necessarily a safe place to do so as you‚Äôre at risk of exposing yourself to exploiters. 

Remember, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this announcement, please do not hesitate to DM myself or another member of the High Rank Team! :)

We don't usually give fired hrs honor member


[19-Dec-20 09:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's only for resignations only


[19-Dec-20 09:17 PM] bonnie591#0591

ooo


[20-Dec-20 09:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
still i dont think we should give it her since we dont give fired people honor


[20-Dec-20 09:07 AM] stacey#1000
What about MRs that get fired and get former MR and are allowed to appeal for that? I don‚Äôt think this is much different


[20-Dec-20 09:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
thats former mr


[20-Dec-20 09:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
she has former hr


[20-Dec-20 09:07 AM] bonnie591#0591
honor member is different


[20-Dec-20 09:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
it is to honor hrs that resign


[20-Dec-20 09:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
not people who get fired


[20-Dec-20 09:08 AM] stacey#1000
Idc if she has it or not tbh


[20-Dec-20 09:10 AM] Fraux#7971

[21-Dec-20 05:23 PM] courtney#5125
alr


[21-Dec-20 05:24 PM] courtney#5125
first u need to type up the suspension letter, here's the template for it: https://trello.com/c/0lyHF6qm/34148-suspension-letter-template just fill in the blanks with the necessary info, like his username, rank, the date and time of the suspension (time u send the letter), reason, etc.


[21-Dec-20 05:24 PM] Fraux#7971
wth thats weird


[21-Dec-20 05:24 PM] lyss#0709
IKr


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] Fraux#7971
maybe contact them first and see what was going on


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] courtney#5125
and you can send the final letter here to see if its good once ur done! @cory!


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] lyss#0709
its happened on 2 different occasions tho, and hes been an mr for over a year and a half


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] courtney#5125
^


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] Fraux#7971
i know so thats def worth seeing why theyre doing that


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] courtney#5125
mirk knows how to interview, hes not completely inactive and still attend sessions frequently


[21-Dec-20 05:25 PM] courtney#5125
@lyss were they a few days apart, do u know?


[21-Dec-20 05:26 PM] lyss#0709
yes ill look


[21-Dec-20 05:26 PM] lyss#0709
first reported incident was on the 19th, second was today


[21-Dec-20 05:27 PM] courtney#5125
okay


[21-Dec-20 05:27 PM] Fraux#7971
we should check it out tho and ask y he's been doing that instead of suspending and going on with our day


[21-Dec-20 05:27 PM] Fraux#7971
obv suspend tho bc thats weird


[21-Dec-20 05:28 PM] Fraux#7971
but still worth asking him n stuff


[21-Dec-20 05:29 PM] cory!#8287
okay do you want me to ask first? or did someone already ask why he did it the first time


[21-Dec-20 05:31 PM] lyss#0709
yeah true fraux itd be worth it to ask


[21-Dec-20 05:31 PM] Fraux#7971
i'm not too sure if someone asked about it, as far as i can tell i haven't heard anyone talk about it before


[21-Dec-20 05:32 PM] lyss#0709
no one asked asked him about it that im aware of


[21-Dec-20 05:32 PM] cory!#8287
okay i can ask him why hes doing it if youd like


[21-Dec-20 05:32 PM] Fraux#7971
sure! that would work


[21-Dec-20 05:32 PM] cory!#8287

@courtney u have his permission


[21-Dec-20 05:50 PM] Polk#1596
But before you guys go through with the suspension, can you check for any previous disciplinary action?


[21-Dec-20 05:51 PM] courtney#5125
@cory! ^^


[21-Dec-20 05:51 PM] courtney#5125

[21-Dec-20 05:51 PM] cory!#8287

[21-Dec-20 05:53 PM] Polk#1596
Perfect, once we get that info we can proceed to determine the duration of his suspension


[21-Dec-20 05:57 PM] courtney#5125
he received a warning due to being immature and making ppl uncomfortable with his actions, received a warning for being unprofessional at training, and then suspended for failing to follow the mr limit. 

so 2 warnings and 1 suspension if i looked at everything correctly


[21-Dec-20 06:09 PM] cory!#8287
okay change of plans mias the the hotel rn so join me if u wanna see her get promoted!


[21-Dec-20 06:13 PM] lyss#0709

We need a solution to tickets asap


[21-Dec-20 08:32 PM] ethan;#0003
They are filling up like wildfire


[21-Dec-20 08:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I wonder if I can buy bloxlink premium and just give it to bloxton server


[21-Dec-20 08:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
cuz this cooldown for !whois is getting on my nerves


[21-Dec-20 08:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It says I can just transfer it but u need to invite the pro bot


[21-Dec-20 08:42 PM] ethan;#0003
How long is the cool down


[21-Dec-20 08:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it sometimes just be when i try to do talkative tickets in a mass bulk


[21-Dec-20 08:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
like when i do "!whois"


[21-Dec-20 08:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
3 times


[21-Dec-20 08:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
like no stop


[21-Dec-20 08:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it be like cooldown


[21-Dec-20 09:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
poor thing


[21-Dec-20 09:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im closed a few tickets because i thought the user left


[21-Dec-20 09:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but it was just the discord server lagging


[21-Dec-20 09:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
so now i gotta wait for it to catch up, find those tickets, and reopen them


[21-Dec-20 09:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@cory! This is for the general ticket area

[21-Dec-20 10:13 PM] Fraux#7971
@KjRBLX eh i see the appeal in it but it's just such an odd spot for MRs to stand that it would be weird to have an invisible box there


[21-Dec-20 10:13 PM] Fraux#7971
maybe if there was an actual spot dedicated to that and not in the middle of the rows


[21-Dec-20 10:14 PM] lyss#0709
@Fraux probs a couple days ago bc i mentioned it here yesterday


[21-Dec-20 10:14 PM] Fraux#7971
hm


[21-Dec-20 10:14 PM] Fraux#7971
ill just note it as then


[22-Dec-20 07:31 PM] cory!#8287
do we still do the security codes for MRs?


[22-Dec-20 08:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053

increase the player count like a few old times üëÄ


[22-Dec-20 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
Last time we did that


[23-Dec-20 12:00 AM] stacey#1000
The whole server crashed and rip the 2+ hours of building


[23-Dec-20 12:01 AM] Fraux#7971
i do not even remember the last time that was


[23-Dec-20 12:01 AM] stacey#1000
Idek


[23-Dec-20 12:01 AM] Fraux#7971
but a general thing that helps with server crashing is the use of meshes


[23-Dec-20 12:01 AM] Fraux#7971
too many mesh bad


[23-Dec-20 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
Maybe a player limit of 75 could work but idk I would just feel bad if the server died and the MRs that help prepare for it hard work gone


[23-Dec-20 12:03 AM] Fraux#7971
yea that shouldn‚Äôt be too bad.. just tell them not to go crazy with meshes and tons of little parts


[23-Dec-20 12:03 AM] Fraux#7971
hopefully i won‚Äôt be working so i can go buttt my boss has been making me work a lot of double shifts so :/

just happened to be a coincidence she joined the same time the raiders joined, dressed the same as the raiders, standing next to the raiders

@High Rank When you guys **Do suspend LRs** what is the average time you do?


[25-Dec-20 08:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
or is there no average


[25-Dec-20 08:38 PM] ethan;#0003
2-3 dayws


[25-Dec-20 08:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Max 5 days usually, minimum is usually 2 days so I'd say average is probs around 3-4 days


[25-Dec-20 08:38 PM] cory!#8287
2-5 days


[25-Dec-20 08:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
midnight or certain hour


[25-Dec-20 08:38 PM] Beartikal#9760
or irrelevant


[25-Dec-20 08:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i go based off


[25-Dec-20 08:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Certain hour but we don't always unsuspend at the exact time because we usually review it twice a day max


[25-Dec-20 08:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Lack of grammar. (No more than 3 days, consider issuing a warning instead)
Unprofessionalism/immaturity. (3-4 days)
Minor cuff abuse. (3-5 days)
Segway abuse. (3-5 days)


[25-Dec-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
segway abuse??


[25-Dec-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
we still suspend for that?


[25-Dec-20 08:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Thats what i got when min did the shift training for me, anna, and courtney


[25-Dec-20 08:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I hardly use the segway abuse...think everytime I ever thought of using it, the person also cuffed abuse too


[25-Dec-20 08:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
so i really just put the two together maybe


[25-Dec-20 10:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh god lol

[26-Dec-20 07:01 AM] stacey#1000
If you are going to the meeting can someone be note taker and can someone set up the vc so it‚Äôs only management+ that can join but only HR+ that can talk as well. I ain‚Äôt great at doing that


[26-Dec-20 07:01 AM] stacey#1000
Let me know ty

[26-Dec-20 08:16 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 just wondering if you were still going to change ban appeals back to let managers do it again with the ban appeals channel. I can add that to the meeting to let managers know then you can add the ban appeals channel back for them again


[26-Dec-20 08:16 AM] stacey#1000
We all agreed on it so


[26-Dec-20 08:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah idk why it hasnt been done yet but we can do it during the meeting


[26-Dec-20 08:17 AM] stacey#1000
Ok so I‚Äôll add it to meeting then you can open the channel again


[26-Dec-20 08:17 AM] stacey#1000
Can you also make the vc for me tomorrow? I‚Äôm bad at it


[26-Dec-20 08:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
Sure


[26-Dec-20 08:17 AM] stacey#1000
@cory! thank you sir!


[26-Dec-20 08:18 AM] stacey#1000
I think we should take attendance of every manager and senior that goes too in case something gets leaked and we will have a list of suspects of who was there and such


[26-Dec-20 08:18 AM] stacey#1000
So if you can help me with that as well that would be great!


[26-Dec-20 08:26 AM] cory!#8287
okay sure


[26-Dec-20 11:49 AM] KjRBLX#2053
@stacey I reacted with the X. I don't know if I'll be going somewhere tomorrow, but if I'm don't go anywhere I'll be at the meeting.

I thought managers already have to log 30 min shifts @stacey


[26-Dec-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
not to my knowledge


[26-Dec-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
only for seniors


[26-Dec-20 08:09 PM] cory!#8287
o


[26-Dec-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
but they want it discussed even if it is


[26-Dec-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
managers never had checklist like seniors


[26-Dec-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
but I also feel like if they logged only a 5-10 minute shift thats basically trying to get a free log


[26-Dec-20 08:10 PM] cory!#8287
also u should discuss that managers should double check usernames when they report cause they still are misspelling usernames


[26-Dec-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
so I think they should have requirements of at least 20 minutes at the least


[26-Dec-20 08:11 PM] cory!#8287
ya 20-30 seems fine to me


[26-Dec-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
thats a plan im also going to mention dont put (User is this) etc that makes no sense


[26-Dec-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
like when they make us change the title of it


[26-Dec-20 08:11 PM] emily#4444
i think it's better than nothing and i think its been 30 for a while


[26-Dec-20 08:11 PM] emily#4444
unless im thinking of seniors but im pretty sure they had to as well


[26-Dec-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
they should have minimum requirements of like 20 mins at least I think


[26-Dec-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
cause if they logged a 5-10 min shift


[26-Dec-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
thats like a free log


[26-Dec-20 08:12 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[26-Dec-20 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
but the thing is if we change management requirements to 20 mins seniors might want theirs changed to 20 mins


[26-Dec-20 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
but we could do that

yeah idk why they are logging 5-10 minute shifts in the first place


[26-Dec-20 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
for seniors too


[26-Dec-20 08:14 PM] emily#4444
20 mins seems good


[26-Dec-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
thats my requirements for logs for scso on stapleton and its fair so


[26-Dec-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
I think it would be good for managers and seniors


[26-Dec-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000
not too short  and not too long


[26-Dec-20 08:14 PM] cory!#8287
yes I agree with u


[26-Dec-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
any other topics u guys want discussed with managers and seniors


[26-Dec-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
like anything u noticed


[26-Dec-20 08:15 PM] stacey#1000
the big topics will be ban appeals and CBs


[26-Dec-20 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
a lot of managers requested for CBs to be discussed


[26-Dec-20 08:18 PM] emily#4444
not that i can think of


[26-Dec-20 08:18 PM] cory!#8287
you can tell them that they should put down generic reasons for bans cause I‚Äôve seen managers put down like ‚ÄúChat exploits‚Äù instead of exploiting and stuff like that. idk if that‚Äôs a big deal or anything


[26-Dec-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
ok ill add that


[26-Dec-20 08:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
if you guys need to unsuspend somebody and they leave the group do you jsut archive the suspension card


[26-Dec-20 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
if they leave the group ya but if they rejoin their suspension is longer


[26-Dec-20 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
a lot of people leave and rejoin to try to get out of a suspension


[26-Dec-20 08:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
ook


[26-Dec-20 08:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
im working on an unsuspension bot that takes care of chores for you guys so should it archive the card or post a comment lettin you guys know they are not at rank suspended rank


[26-Dec-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
if it ranks them back it can just archive it


[26-Dec-20 08:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah


[26-Dec-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
bear while u are here is there anything u wanted mentioned to the mrs tomorrow or no cause im hosting an MR meeting


[26-Dec-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
for managers and seniors


[26-Dec-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
not heads


[26-Dec-20 08:25 PM] Beartikal#9760
like what


[26-Dec-20 08:26 PM] stacey#1000
we are going to discuss getting rid of the cb rule all together


[26-Dec-20 08:26 PM] stacey#1000
like not banning for cb anymore


[26-Dec-20 08:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah bcuz its a dumb rule lol


[26-Dec-20 08:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
they keep rejoining


[26-Dec-20 08:26 PM] stacey#1000
it will be gone tomorrow


[26-Dec-20 08:26 PM] stacey#1000
no more banning for being a cb


[26-Dec-20 08:27 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok thats good but trying to get MRs to understand is going to be: üíÄ


[26-Dec-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000
a lot of managers requested cbs to be dicussed


[26-Dec-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000
they complaining about losing track of who is a cb and not for adding ban request


[26-Dec-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000
so I think they will like it being gone


[26-Dec-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000
i hope


[26-Dec-20 08:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
ig we find out


[26-Dec-20 08:28 PM] Beartikal#9760

[26-Dec-20 08:28 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Dec-20 08:40 PM] stacey#1000
Greetings  HHADMIN,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been demoted from your position as *17 | Vice Chairman.** to **14 | Shift Manager** at Bloxton Hotels as of **12/27/2020**. The reasoning behind your demotion is due to **NOT DOING YOUR JOB**. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our High-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a demotion in order to ensure our company is running at the best it can. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

**All the HRs**
Bloxton Hotels


[26-Dec-20 08:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053

generals reaction to see HHADMIN as rank 14 is great


[26-Dec-20 09:01 PM] impact#0297
notice how the staff lounge was leaked so fast


[26-Dec-20 09:01 PM] impact#0297
to general discussion


[26-Dec-20 09:02 PM] stacey#1000
no anyone can easily go on the group and see he is rank 14 now


[26-Dec-20 09:02 PM] stacey#1000
its public information easily


[26-Dec-20 09:02 PM] stacey#1000
so its not that anything was leaked its just anyone can go and see the ranks


[26-Dec-20 09:02 PM] impact#0297
there is no fucking way that they knew that fast


[26-Dec-20 09:03 PM] impact#0297
nobody checks to see if HHadmin gets demoted


[26-Dec-20 09:03 PM] impact#0297
like the shift in conversation was so fast


[26-Dec-20 09:03 PM] stacey#1000
people check HR ranks a lot


[26-Dec-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
dk why this cards in suspensions

https://trello.com/c/BszUDzaf/38306-andria5330-7-unprofessional-lack-of-grammar


[26-Dec-20 09:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
they are rank 7 rn??


[26-Dec-20 09:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
unless its not done


[26-Dec-20 09:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can rejoin the group and train back up, if they are caught doing it though they get re suspended and the suspension is extended


[26-Dec-20 09:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh didnt think of ppl doing that


[26-Dec-20 09:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
damn


[26-Dec-20 09:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
wait


[26-Dec-20 09:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
where's the due date?


[26-Dec-20 09:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
when i was lr/mr i looked at rank very often. i still do tbh at other groups. even if someone did say omg hhadmin is rank 14 in general and they knew via the announcement, it wouldnt actually matter since its public information soo either way no biggie


[26-Dec-20 09:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I would of said, give people a certain amount of time to delete


[26-Dec-20 09:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but then people would start exploiting that


[26-Dec-20 09:35 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if they are purposely saying it and deleting it


[26-Dec-20 09:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
@impact can u test smthn for me


[26-Dec-20 09:35 PM] stacey#1000
obv ban them


[26-Dec-20 09:36 PM] stacey#1000
but something that looks like a genuine accident they shouldnt get banned for

[26-Dec-20 09:39 PM] Polk#1596
does it work if i do setrank


[26-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
i mean its up rn so yes but i wouldnt do it just yet not quite done with it


[26-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
max rank is set to Receptionist


[26-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
furthermore you cannot use any ranking commands on MR+


[26-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Beartikal#9760
they have to be suspended, etc. by hand


[26-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Polk#1596
ooo


[26-Dec-20 09:40 PM] Polk#1596
yeah thats fine


[26-Dec-20 09:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
i've also made a "watcher" for the Suspensions list and re-ranks them automatically when the due-date is complete on Trello


[26-Dec-20 09:41 PM] impact#0297
you should add it for MR‚Äôs though..


[26-Dec-20 09:41 PM] Polk#1596
thats awesome


[26-Dec-20 09:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
@impact wym


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] Polk#1596
saving us a ton of work


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
MRs shouldnt have the ability to rank @impact


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats asking for danger


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] impact#0297
Is the suspension command working for MR‚Äôs though


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] impact#0297
That‚Äôs what I meant


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
i mean theoretically i can make it work for MRs but i dont think they should have that power


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] impact#0297
No no


[26-Dec-20 09:42 PM] Polk#1596
i think he is asking if it affects MRs


[26-Dec-20 09:43 PM] Polk#1596
if you were to setrank them


[26-Dec-20 09:43 PM] impact#0297
Can HR‚Äôs use the suspend command on MR‚Äôs


[26-Dec-20 09:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
no i disabled that on purpose


[26-Dec-20 09:43 PM] impact#0297
Why


[26-Dec-20 09:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
i feel that should be done by hand, attaching proof, etc. on Trello


[26-Dec-20 09:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
plus it shows the user that demoted the MR in audit logs as well instead of HHADMIN


[26-Dec-20 09:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
i do have logs but eh


[26-Dec-20 09:44 PM] impact#0297
That‚Äôs not the right way of thinking of it


[26-Dec-20 09:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
so dis is wat u guys have been workin on hm


[26-Dec-20 09:44 PM] impact#0297
You could make it so that it does the suspension but the bot produces a link that allows the HR to add evidence


[26-Dec-20 09:44 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal can you make an api that links to discord so we can check how long a player spends at the hotel


[26-Dec-20 09:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
additionally the bot cannot set ranks back to MR+


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
so ud have to manually unsuspend


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
anyway


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Polk#1596
i mean thats fine


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
safety tings


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] ethan;#0003
Activity checker api


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Polk#1596
we suspend and unsuspend LRs a hundred times a week


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] ethan;#0003
That tracks time someone spends at the hotel


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Polk#1596
MRs maybe once or twice a month or more


[26-Dec-20 09:45 PM] Polk#1596
how would that work ethan


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Every group has it


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
We are like the only group that doesn‚Äôt have some sort of activity tracking


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
what logger system do they use @ethan;


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
is it like a website


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
or ingame


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Hyra, or campfire


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] Polk#1596
did baby like hyra?


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
what the hekc is campfire


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Campfire made hyra


[26-Dec-20 09:46 PM] impact#0297
@Beartikal @babymariobebe Thank you for listening to the high ranks. Whatever you can produce to make routine tasks more efficient is welcomed.

this person needs to be suspended


[27-Dec-20 12:35 AM] ethan;#0003
or fired


[27-Dec-20 12:35 AM] ethan;#0003
someone is cuff abusing


[27-Dec-20 12:35 AM] Beartikal#9760
then use the bot üòâ @ethan;


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
u can be the first tester ; )


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
is it rankset ranks


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
for the number


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
of the rank


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
its ;suspend username "provided reason" (numDays)


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] Beartikal#9760
so like ;suspend beartikal "bad boy" 2


[27-Dec-20 12:36 AM] ethan;#0003
cuff abusing = fire  i think


[27-Dec-20 12:37 AM] ethan;#0003
so i would do


[27-Dec-20 12:37 AM] ethan;#0003
;suspend (user) (reason) rankID?


[27-Dec-20 12:37 AM] ethan;#0003
O


[27-Dec-20 12:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
for setting ranks theres no reason u just do


[27-Dec-20 12:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
u do ;setrank username 1


[27-Dec-20 12:37 AM] Beartikal#9760
i dont rlly have a "fire" command hee yet to post a fire request on the trello

[27-Dec-20 12:39 AM] ethan;#0003
or is that not possible


[27-Dec-20 12:39 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can yea


[27-Dec-20 12:39 AM] ethan;#0003
and add the ability to add a link image for proof


[27-Dec-20 12:39 AM] ethan;#0003
like ;setrank (USER) (proof in link) (rankID)


[27-Dec-20 12:39 AM] Beartikal#9760
how about i make a ;fire command and then it will ask you for the stuffs


[27-Dec-20 12:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
since i have a ;suspend 1


[27-Dec-20 12:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
would that work


[27-Dec-20 12:41 AM] ethan;#0003
yes that sounds pog


[27-Dec-20 12:42 AM] Beartikal#9760
hows bout ;fire (user) ("reason") ("proof links go here")


[27-Dec-20 12:43 AM] Beartikal#9760
ex: ;fire beartikal "bad" "gyazo.com/bla imgsnap.com/bla gyazo.com/bla"


[27-Dec-20 12:45 AM] ethan;#0003
very pog


[27-Dec-20 12:51 AM] ethan;#0003
what if seniors could use it to rank people during trainings, it would save us time so we wouldnt need to rank like 10 servers


[27-Dec-20 12:51 AM] ethan;#0003
and they somehow only give them the ability to rank people to LR ranks


[27-Dec-20 12:51 AM] Beartikal#9760
the bot currently is restricted to LR ranks so thats not the problem


[27-Dec-20 12:51 AM] ethan;#0003
that would save us a lot of time


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] ethan;#0003
cus some of us forget to rank


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
personally i'd do a command from within the game


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] ethan;#0003
YES PLS


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] ethan;#0003
sizzle burger has that


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] ethan;#0003
like !rank (user) (rank)


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
yes


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
i can do that sure


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
consider it done


[27-Dec-20 12:52 AM] ethan;#0003
that would save SOOO much time


[27-Dec-20 01:57 AM] Beartikal#9760
can I also receive a link to Hiya since i dont know what that is and i want to see how it works/etc.

Hyra | Free Application Centres & Activity Tracking
Hi all! Hope you‚Äôre well.  This past week, I‚Äôve launched my new flagship application centre software called Hyra. The concept of the platform was founded from the lack of quality, well-structured free application centres. The project has taken about 6 months to get fully complete, and has already got over 2,500 registered users in the first week...

also it looks like they collect name and phone numbers which is absolutely unnecessary

@bonnie591 Jax sent a image of a petition. He didn‚Äôt cover the zip code on it. They were pinging him but i just deleted the photo and he returned that it wasnt his actual zipcode i believe because he was traveling. But i dont thini she should of went around spreading that information into another chat.


[27-Dec-20 11:46 AM] KjRBLX#2053
You prob can find when it happened by trying to remember what was said during the time

Believe it was a petition to get rid of bloxton hotels from roblox


[27-Dec-20 11:51 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Because if u scroll down i said 100 signs to remove a 1m+ group


[27-Dec-20 12:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hm


[27-Dec-20 12:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
I guess we could consider something like a warning since it wasn't his actual zipcode


[27-Dec-20 12:13 PM] bonnie591#0591

hey guys


[27-Dec-20 02:56 PM] Beartikal#9760
when you use the rank command and say ;rank [user] 7, do you expect it to rank them to Receptionist


[27-Dec-20 02:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
the receptionist number is actually 8 via the group, so would you want me to subtract 1 so you can avoid confusion


[27-Dec-20 02:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
i guess ill do that


[27-Dec-20 03:00 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yes


[27-Dec-20 03:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yes.


[27-Dec-20 03:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So, what are we gonna do with the appeals in the databse that haven't been answered?

Alright, everyone left the meeting vc, so I locked it up.


[27-Dec-20 04:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And with the appeal thing, I think we may should just change it to they get appealed based on the amount of trouble they've caused.


[27-Dec-20 04:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like, the more harder it is for them and prob should require a vote.


[27-Dec-20 04:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill be messing w/ the bot for a bit until i have a few more useful commands on it


[27-Dec-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! I denied Lucas from every appealing because back in May while he was actively trying to appeal his blacklist he leaked a photo from staff lounge and ruined his appeal chances.


[27-Dec-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Dec-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000

:bloxton3: **__CHAT BUBBLE REPORTS__** :bloxton3: 

Salutations, Bloxton community!

The HR Team has agreed to prohibit the use of chat bubble proof for evidence in our reporting channels and for reporting anyone in general. This includes **trollers** and **staff** members. For evidence to be valid, you must get evidence from the chatbox or if you're an MR from chatlogs. We have decided to bring back this rule due to people framing others with chat bubble evidence by photoshopping it. 

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this new adjustment, then do not hesitate to message a member of the HR Team. Thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day/night!

*Sincerely,*
**cvoryy**
**Shift Manager**
**Bloxton Hotels**

[27-Dec-20 09:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Uhhhh


[27-Dec-20 09:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmmm


[27-Dec-20 09:35 PM] Polk#1596

[27-Dec-20 09:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[27-Dec-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
uh


[27-Dec-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
yeah


[27-Dec-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
sure


[27-Dec-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh ok i can add meme commands if u want


[27-Dec-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
where it edits your pfp


[27-Dec-20 11:44 PM] stacey#1000
can the bot do anything to help with appeals or no just wondering


[27-Dec-20 11:45 PM] stacey#1000
like can it send people if its accepted or denied


[27-Dec-20 11:45 PM] stacey#1000
idek


[27-Dec-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
it *can*


[27-Dec-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
i just need a description on how youd want that to work


[27-Dec-20 11:53 PM] Beartikal#9760
i can add that feature


[28-Dec-20 12:05 AM] stacey#1000
idk how it would work


[28-Dec-20 12:06 AM] stacey#1000
like if the bot could like send a message to people with the reason their appeal is denied or if it can alert them they are unbanned


[28-Dec-20 12:06 AM] stacey#1000
or if it can unban people from the hotel


[28-Dec-20 12:06 AM] Tattoblue#5828
maybe  people can dm the bot their appeal and then once a reaction is added in the manager channel for ban appeals it notifies them if it was a checkmark or a x


[28-Dec-20 12:19 AM] ethan;#0003

@Beartikal  You should change the textbuttons to textboxs at the IC and TC, turn off "ClearTextOnFocus" and "TextEditable", scale the text, so we can highlight the names and just copy and paste.


[29-Dec-20 01:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but prob dont use "TextScaled" as in when I used that it was giving me trouble highlighting

[29-Dec-20 03:15 PM] bonnie591#0591

@Beartikal Maybe you can make the bot tell us whether a discord user is linked with bloxlink and has a discord and roblox account age of 30+, and is a hotel guest all under 1 command


[30-Dec-20 04:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
why blozlink one


[30-Dec-20 04:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
because the we do talkative checks with bloxlink

whatif


[30-Dec-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
it auto does it


[30-Dec-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
it checks if there discord is above 30


[30-Dec-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
and there roblox is above 30


[30-Dec-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
that would automate tickets
