some of the ones asking are just here to cause unneeded drama I'd rather not


[01-Oct-20 01:18 AM] impact#0297
Noted. I need better reasoning though if we want to go through with this.


[01-Oct-20 01:23 AM] babymariobebe#7563
what reasoning


[01-Oct-20 01:23 AM] babymariobebe#7563
just tell them no, no means no


[01-Oct-20 10:07 AM] impact#0297

[01-Oct-20 10:08 AM] impact#0297
@High Rank if anyone knows how to fix the ticket bot on the server, please go for it. I don't have permissions.


[01-Oct-20 10:08 AM] ethan;#0003

if the bot doesnt come back online in the next few days im in favour of trying to find a better bot


[01-Oct-20 11:13 AM] bonnie591#0591
as the one right now does the job but it isnt the best


[01-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
cant we get rid of the manual ticket verification for talkative role


[01-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
because to talk in the server anyways you need to have a verified email


[01-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
and alt accounts dont have verified emails


[01-Oct-20 11:15 AM] ethan;#0003
or i mean like spam accounts


[01-Oct-20 11:15 AM] ethan;#0003
troll accounts and stuff dont have verified emails

And then with talkative role, if people use talkative role reaction, it would send it to whatever category list u want, and with the category list we could allow seniors to see the talkative category.

informal warning, FORMAL warning, or suspension


[01-Oct-20 04:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Definitely formal warming and suspension

[01-Oct-20 05:55 PM] courtney#5125
i personally vote suspension. shes a senior manager and shes been on the mr team for years. she should definitely know that its not okay to abuse the command that many times and its not ok to be that immature in a room that still has trainees and helpers actively learning. she did the command at least 6 times, and she was bringing them to a spot where they literally kept glitching and she wouldnt stop doing it


[01-Oct-20 06:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Agreed. ^


[01-Oct-20 06:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Greetings Imag1native,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as 12 | Senior Management at Bloxton Hotels as of 11:10 AM CST, October 2nd, 2020. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to abuse of the ":bring" command and immaturity at a training session. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is set to conclude on Monday, October 5th, at 11:10 AM CST, where you may then return to your responsibilities. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Best regards,

ccandvy
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

[05-Oct-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
He still isn‚Äôt active


[05-Oct-20 04:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Good job


[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] courtney#5125

[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea go ahead


[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] courtney#5125
yay ty


[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
Oh btw Bonnie


[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
For the person that was leaking


[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
I haven‚Äôt noticed anyone recently leaking but there is still someone that is


[05-Oct-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
So for the managers promos on hold


[05-Oct-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe promote one at a time. Wait a few days. See if any management stuff is leaked and if not it‚Äôs not them


[05-Oct-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
But don‚Äôt promote them all at once


[05-Oct-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
cause idk what else to look at for whoever‚Äôs leaking


[05-Oct-20 04:05 PM] courtney#5125
what would be the reasoning for his warning btw


[05-Oct-20 04:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Didn't dooner go on an inactive notice


[05-Oct-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Oh we almost at max managers too


[05-Oct-20 04:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Recently


[05-Oct-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[05-Oct-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
He is still the next one that‚Äôs sus out of all of them


[05-Oct-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Whoever it is is in bst timezone


[05-Oct-20 04:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Management limit is 60 right


[05-Oct-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think so


[05-Oct-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
didnt baby adjust it couple months ago


[05-Oct-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
could of sworn he did


[05-Oct-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[05-Oct-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs 60 now


[05-Oct-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
We at 54 right now


[05-Oct-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
But which managers out of that are inactive


[05-Oct-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
A good handful


[05-Oct-20 04:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
I thought the limit was 65 but I'm unsure


[05-Oct-20 04:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh bear raised it to 60


[05-Oct-20 04:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
But


[05-Oct-20 04:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm pretty sure it was 65 but u guys thought it was 50 lmao


[05-Oct-20 04:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Anyway since we are getting close to the limit let's make sure we are promoting the ones who deserve it the most since there has been a decrease in resignations


[05-Oct-20 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn‚Äôt promote Dooner rn tbh


[05-Oct-20 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
I would cancel his promo for now if he‚Äôs gone inactive and he‚Äôs suspicious of leaking but again idk


[05-Oct-20 04:12 PM] Polk#1596
LOL of course she goes to me https://gyazo.com/0feab3f448ce117a92a2bf2c739a8ee1

Tell her..."You know what you did. -turns the other cheek and walks away dramatically-"


[05-Oct-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
I remember asking to get the limit raised


[05-Oct-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
I asked for it to be raised when the senior limit was raised to 25


[05-Oct-20 04:14 PM] Polk#1596
ik but bonnie always said it was 50

As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a formal warning in an effort to remind you of your wrongdoings. We ask you take this formal warning as a reminder and work towards improvement in the future to prevent any further implications.

It was 65 lmao not 50. It was 50 in 2017 / 2018 then it was raised. Unless it decreased again then it would of been 65 but 60 is a good number and we should stick with that

MRs seem to be getting super strict at interviews, I even say in my PM at the start not to be strict. Maybe an announcement should be made as this isn't the first time I've seen it, this is just based on a close observation since my interview session this afternoon was small. In my opinion, failing for those two things above is super strict.

they failed for BLOXTON TAGGING


[06-Oct-20 07:46 AM] courtney#5125
at least the first one is at least somewhat understandable


[06-Oct-20 07:47 AM] courtney#5125
I agree with an announcement, I‚Äôve noticed that I usually only end up with around 10 interviewees after doing a relatively simple grammar test in a full server


[06-Oct-20 07:55 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I think you should make an announcement


[06-Oct-20 07:55 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn if you need help making the announcement let me know


[06-Oct-20 07:56 AM] stacey#1000
Should include examples of what now to fail for in it and what to fail for


[06-Oct-20 07:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank Vote on above, por favor.


[06-Oct-20 07:56 AM] stacey#1000
Not*


[06-Oct-20 07:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'd also like to include a few reminders such as checking PMs as I've noticed a few MRs, mainly our newer MRs, failing to read the entire PMs sent to them in sessions.


[06-Oct-20 07:57 AM] stacey#1000
I love writing announcements. Can  I write it for you but then you can announce it @xM_inn

Ok I‚Äôll write it when I‚Äôm home in about 40 minutes. You will have your announcement in 1 hour

But ya include checking PMs

[06-Oct-20 07:58 AM] stacey#1000

[06-Oct-20 08:11 AM] Polk#1596
i wrote a "dont be so strict while interviewing" announcement not too long ago


[06-Oct-20 08:11 AM] Polk#1596
but going more in depth with grammar stuff would be nice


[06-Oct-20 08:52 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn making announcement rn but what if they don‚Äôt capitalize Bloxton hotels? But spell it correct, would you consider that minor if they have it lowercase like ‚Äúbloxton hotels‚Äù or ‚ÄúBloxton hotels‚Äù


[06-Oct-20 08:52 AM] stacey#1000
Or would you fail that


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] stacey#1000
I would say it‚Äôs minor


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
That's minor


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'd say pas


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
pass*


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
Just remind them to capitalize


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
I also feel like we'd have a lot more people passing interviews if they had a better chance of passing the grammar test


[06-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
their mistakes are sometimes accidental and they still get kicked


[06-Oct-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000
Ok will mention that in announcement


[06-Oct-20 08:54 AM] xM_inn#2821

This is a long announcement because  its 2 announcements in one basically


[06-Oct-20 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
Strictness on Grammar Test & Reading PMs more carefully. 

Greetings, MR Team. 

Recently, the HR team has noticed many of you have been failing people during the grammar test at interviews for minor mistakes. This could be over a space, period, comma, question mark, lowercase letter, or a word getting tagged due to safe chat. I would like to make it very clear that you CANNOT fail anyone for minor errors. We don‚Äôt want to be too strict and ensure we are being fair to others. Everyone makes minor grammar mistakes, even I do. It‚Äôs not fair to fail someone simply because they made a minor grammar mistake. 

I will list some examples of grammar tests with minor errors that you CANNOT fail people for. 

Minor errors:
-Hello, welcome to Bloxton hotels how can I help you
-Hello can I get a room please 
-Greetings and welcome to bloxton hotels. What can I get you today
-Hello I want a room here,please and thank you 
-Hello I‚Äôm here to get interviewed for Bloxton hotels 

So, basically if they forget a space, question mark, period, or anything that is minor, they should not be failed and instead given a friendly reminder of what their error was and passed. 

Also, if they forget to capitalize Bloxton Hotels, but spell it correctly, that is a minor error that they should NOT be failed for. Instead, you should kindly remind them to capitalize it. Remember to also keep in mind that people with safe chat, the word Bloxton tags. So their grammar test might look like ‚ÄúHello, welcome to ###### hotels, how can I help you?‚Äù You should not be kicking them for the word Bloxton tagging. This has happened too many times and people should never be getting kicked for a word tagging that is out of their control. 


Here are some examples of major grammar errors that you CAN fail people for.

Major errors:
-hello wlecome to Bloxton how can i help u today.

Major grammar errors are usually obvious to catch. If they have many lowercase letters, misspell a word, and overall the whole sentence is grammatically incorrect that is a major error that they can be failed for.  

If you are ever unsure about a grammar test, don‚Äôt be afraid to PM the host of the server to have them view it to get their opinion on if they should be failed or passed. 

If you are caught failing someone over a minor grammar mistake, you may be given a warning and in many offences, a suspension. Please keep in mind to not fail over small things.

Reading PMs more carefully:

Another thing the HR team has noticed recently is that many of you have been failing to read PMs and not abiding by them at sessions. Hosts send PMs for a reason, and you should always be reading them carefully and following them.

Just because you have read the PM before, or assume it is the same one that is not an excuse to take 1 minute of your time to read it and make sure you understand what the host is asking. It‚Äôs not hard to read a PM, it doesn‚Äôt take long at all. When you ignore a PM and don‚Äôt follow the instructions of the host, you are sending a message you don‚Äôt care and have no time to read a PM.  That is unprofessional and not fair to the host. 

Going forward, when a PM is sent to you, hosts have the full authority to request for you to reply to it to ensure you have read it. This could be by saying ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù  So please, please just read PMs more carefully and take 1 minute of your time to actually read them. 
 
Failing to read a PM and not following what the host has requested can result in consequences such as a suspension or warning. To avoid this, read PMs please. We shouldn‚Äôt have to keep announcing this. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding these policy‚Äôs, feel free to message any member of the HR team. 

Best regards,
staceyvx 
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels.

[06-Oct-20 03:57 PM] Polk#1596
i dont understand what she wants @katie


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
i served her the reason on a silver plate


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
theres no "further details"


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
it was your daily pings


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
thats it


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"But after I checked my daily ping most of it were friends and people who asked to be added"


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Why did they have to check?


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They should of already knew who they were pinging.


[06-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
if u want katie, you can check the screenshots i posted yesterday to see our convo


[06-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
exactly kj


[06-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
you can tell she is lying


[06-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
her whole "daily ping" was such a joke


[06-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
she writes "want me to delete you off my daily? pm me! (just a heads up, ill ignore it)"


[06-Oct-20 04:00 PM] Polk#1596
and im preeetttyy sure im not friends with her and i feel like many of them arent friends with her either


[06-Oct-20 04:00 PM] Polk#1596
and then her quote of the day is obviously connected to guest, and all that drama


[06-Oct-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
This is why I go fake offline so she won‚Äôt message me


[06-Oct-20 04:00 PM] Polk#1596
"fly high like guest" and "fly higher than guest"


[06-Oct-20 04:01 PM] Polk#1596
yeah she is annoying to deal with


[06-Oct-20 04:01 PM] Polk#1596
thats why i said im not obligated to show you evidence, she knows what she did and she is just putting on an act


[06-Oct-20 04:01 PM] Polk#1596
and once i told her the reason, which is what the evidence shows, she wanted further details


[06-Oct-20 04:01 PM] Polk#1596
ü§∑ irest my case


[06-Oct-20 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
She can‚Äôt accept the fact she has to appeal like everyone else


[06-Oct-20 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
And wants special treatment


[06-Oct-20 04:02 PM] Polk#1596
mhm, she can message us all she wants but she is going to follow the normal procedure anyone else goes through


[06-Oct-20 04:03 PM] Polk#1596
and if she gets back in, she gotta prove to us that she is worthy of the former mr role


[06-Oct-20 04:03 PM] Polk#1596
i lost all trust in her after this


[06-Oct-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah

[07-Oct-20 07:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'm gonna informally warn both of them to not be as harsh cause them grammar tests, especially the first one, are such small mistakes


[07-Oct-20 07:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
The first one isn't even valid, Bloxton Hotel or Bloxton Hotels is fine. They both mean the same thing


[07-Oct-20 07:53 AM] courtney#5125
@katie @anna @Tattoblue @xM_inn thank y‚Äôall so much!! :)


[07-Oct-20 08:17 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn yeah warn them both and if both of those MRs do that multiple times they get suspended


[07-Oct-20 08:17 AM] stacey#1000
I think their next occurrence would be like a written warning and then suspension


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yup #warnings


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs annoying even after I  announced it


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
Written if it happens again


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
And if it happens again


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
Then... they need to reconsider a lot of things


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821

Literally not even 24 hours after


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] stacey#1000
They both better learn and fast


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] stacey#1000
Otherwise things don‚Äôt look good for them


[07-Oct-20 08:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
Mhm


[07-Oct-20 08:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
They were both apologetic tho


[07-Oct-20 08:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
So lets hope they improve


[07-Oct-20 08:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
It's just so irritating, especially when your server is small cause at 12pm BST interviews only have like 20 people

[07-Oct-20 08:20 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs going to be criticizing us about something


[07-Oct-20 08:30 AM] Polk#1596
now thats interesting


[07-Oct-20 08:30 AM] Polk#1596
i wonder what she will criticize us for


[07-Oct-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
What I can say about this, is I agree with the management board part. I myself lack at looking at it because I don‚Äôt have time but I could more. And shift managers when you have time you can clear bans as well, it doesn‚Äôt have to be through banning sessions all the time. You don‚Äôt have to clear the whole board but if you have time to clear even 50 bans it helps


[07-Oct-20 08:44 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs been done by GM+ through banning sessions all the time.

[07-Oct-20 08:47 AM] courtney#5125
she makes a lottt of good points there, especially about the part with some hrs being unprofessional (i myself often have to catch myself from trying to misbehave with friends in front of other lrs), clearing the boards more often, and answering dms


[07-Oct-20 08:47 AM] courtney#5125
i specifically remember actually talking with bman in staff discussion when i was a senior about dming hrs


[07-Oct-20 08:48 AM] stacey#1000
So Imag knew she was being annoying this whole time asking us to do stuff, but she‚Äôs the only one that could actually dm us without being scared about stuff that actually did need to be done


[07-Oct-20 08:48 AM] stacey#1000
I respect her


[07-Oct-20 08:49 AM] courtney#5125
its not necessarily scary to dm an hr, but depending on who you dm, it could be. if one of us never answers dms, then that person will ultimately be scared to dm any hr because they cant decide on whats important enough to "bother" us about


[07-Oct-20 08:49 AM] courtney#5125
but yes she makes some very good points, something that would definitely make us a better hr team and better leaders if we listened


[07-Oct-20 08:49 AM] stacey#1000
I agree with everything she said


[07-Oct-20 08:50 AM] stacey#1000
The management board part the most


[07-Oct-20 08:50 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs never done as often as it should be


[07-Oct-20 08:50 AM] stacey#1000
And it shouldn‚Äôt be done with banning sessions all the time


[07-Oct-20 08:50 AM] stacey#1000
We ask our seniors to do a lot


[07-Oct-20 08:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
Not sure I agree with the maturity point within this paragraph, there's a difference between being immature and then having fun during sessions. Not everything is supposed to be all strict as we're not a military group. If she sees an HR being immature, she should report it instead. We, as BODs, can't do anything unless we're told about it. And if it's a BOD that needs reporting, then she needs to contact Baby or Bear. I think she needs to understand that there's a difference between being immature at sessions and having a slight bit of fun at sessions. That's my perspective, at least. Sessions will get boring if you can't have fun.

[07-Oct-20 08:52 AM] stacey#1000
I myself only act immature when the session is done and if it‚Äôs only MRs


[07-Oct-20 08:52 AM] stacey#1000
But not often


[07-Oct-20 08:52 AM] stacey#1000
I also spoke to her about the inactivity part already


[07-Oct-20 08:53 AM] stacey#1000
I told her people make a notice every month and as HRs we have to check in as well and stuff


[07-Oct-20 08:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
Not to mention, I personally have never witnessed an HR who interrupts any ongoing training if they're having a small bit of fun. If you're going into the training rooms and clearly interrupting then yes that's unacceptable. But if you're simply in the lobby and just talking or being a little bit silly to ensure the session is fun, I don't see the harm in it. As long as it's not every session.


[07-Oct-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I‚Äôve never noticed problems with any HRs regarding that


[07-Oct-20 08:54 AM] courtney#5125
yeah another good point min, there is a difference between having fun and blatantly ignoring all rules about maturity


[07-Oct-20 08:54 AM] stacey#1000
The main thing I agreed with was clearing the manager boards and how not many of us do it


[07-Oct-20 08:54 AM] courtney#5125
^


[07-Oct-20 08:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah, I do agree with that.


[07-Oct-20 08:55 AM] courtney#5125
when i first became an hr, that was one thing i thought i would constantly be doing, but i just started to forget about it


[07-Oct-20 08:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
About HR inactivity; I'm not sure if she can can exactly comment on that considering HR activity and stuff is private. We all do things behind the scenes if we're not hosting sessions. HR activity is managed by BODs and the Founders so it's not really her place to comment on that. But I guess her feedback is appreciated.


[07-Oct-20 08:55 AM] courtney#5125
yeah i don't quiteee understand her argument there


[07-Oct-20 08:55 AM] stacey#1000
All I told her about that is that we have to check in


[07-Oct-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
Like MRs do


[07-Oct-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
I didn‚Äôt tell her about we have notices too


[07-Oct-20 08:56 AM] stacey#1000
But like we can‚Äôt just go inactive for months without a notice or saying anything so


[07-Oct-20 08:56 AM] courtney#5125
mrs are able to go inactive for as long as they please as long as they have a valid notice, they just need to provide a valid update as to why they still need to be inactive each month


[07-Oct-20 08:56 AM] courtney#5125
LOL stacey


[07-Oct-20 08:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
All other arguments have some strong points though and with that I respect her for taking time to make the document.


[07-Oct-20 08:57 AM] courtney#5125
ditto


[07-Oct-20 08:57 AM] stacey#1000
For the replying to DMs thing


[07-Oct-20 08:57 AM] courtney#5125
replying to dms really shouldn't be an issue for available and active hrs


[07-Oct-20 08:58 AM] courtney#5125
if she dms an hr who's often offline for days at a time and hasn't done any activity, then she shouldnt be that expectant of an answer


[07-Oct-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
I mean if she does dm an hr to host


[07-Oct-20 08:58 AM] stacey#1000
They should respond yes


[07-Oct-20 08:58 AM] courtney#5125
but its completely understandable to be confused as to why a perfectly active and online hr ignores a dm


[07-Oct-20 08:59 AM] courtney#5125
its not hard to reply, i just responded to 220 wishing me happy birthday


[07-Oct-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
I mean sometimes I forget to reply


[07-Oct-20 09:00 AM] courtney#5125
and yes ofc a happy birthday doesnt take as long to reply to, a lot of people dm us with major concerns with long paragraphs and lots of evidence, but it still shouldn't be that difficult for each of us as a team to simply reply with "Okay, thank you so much for the report [or whatever it is]. I'll see what I can do!"


[07-Oct-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
But most of the time now I‚Äôm offline


[07-Oct-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
But to serious stuff yes I‚Äôll reply


[07-Oct-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Like this


[07-Oct-20 09:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly, I don't reply to her that much, but I have reasoning. If she DMs me with unnecessary stuff or stuff that I'm already aware of then she can't always expect a reply, I get DMs so much daily and it's a struggle trying to reply to all of them considering how long I've been a HR now; it gets repetitive. If I'm the only HR on or the situation is urgent or I need more information, then I'll reply. I always read her DMs and stuff, but I don't always reply cause I either forget or I just don't need to reply. For example, here's some DMs she sent me last week which weren't very helpful:

[07-Oct-20 09:01 AM] stacey#1000
But to the people that are like ‚Äúexcuse me?‚Äù No I don‚Äôt


[07-Oct-20 09:01 AM] courtney#5125
yeah and it isnt your fault if you just dont have time to reply to dms, but someone whos online often and active shouldnt have tooooo much of a hard time replying


[07-Oct-20 09:01 AM] courtney#5125
*is active


[07-Oct-20 09:02 AM] xM_inn#2821
For example, if she sends me an MR report or asks to host; yes, I'll reply.


[07-Oct-20 09:02 AM] courtney#5125
thats a good point min, we get plenty of dms that are just simply pointless. but honestly if we want to make improvements, maybe its time to actually respond to at least some of the small stuff


[07-Oct-20 09:02 AM] courtney#5125
just to make it a habit


[07-Oct-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
I think we should reply to them all


[07-Oct-20 09:02 AM] xM_inn#2821
Idk, but like when she DMs me at least 4-5 times a week (used to be daily up until recently), it's quite the challenge.


[07-Oct-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
Even if you are aware of it, but she is like reminding you, you can just say thank you for informing me and move on so she doesn‚Äôt think you don‚Äôt care  or are ignoring her


[07-Oct-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what she thinks


[07-Oct-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
I mean


[07-Oct-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
It does get annoying when she constantly reminds us


[07-Oct-20 09:04 AM] stacey#1000
But at same time still has to be done


[07-Oct-20 09:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
The thing is, I always read my DMs, every single DM sent to me. I just don't always reply since I have so many DMs to read on a morning when I wake up. I read every single one though, regardless of what the DM is.


[07-Oct-20 09:04 AM] Tattoblue#5828
imag barely dms me, unless shes asking if she can host for me lol


[07-Oct-20 09:04 AM] xM_inn#2821
Anyways, I do understand most of her points, but there is a few that I am opposed towards.


[07-Oct-20 09:04 AM] stacey#1000
Imag DMs me everything now lol


[07-Oct-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm happy she took time to write this


[07-Oct-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
There is stuff I disagree with too but also agree with


[07-Oct-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt agree with the inactivity thing or maturity thing


[07-Oct-20 09:05 AM] courtney#5125
yeah i'm sure we all read all of the dms we get or at least most, and no matter how many times we say we read them, the person that dms us won't ever know that we read it


[07-Oct-20 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
I agree with the management board part and the replying to DMs part


[07-Oct-20 09:06 AM] courtney#5125
when i was like a head i dmed an hr (whos currently no longer an hr so im not blaming any of u) about someone that leaked channels, and the hr was online and was active on discord. but i never received a response, so from then on, i just figured it wasnt important enough and i was hesitant to make reports on leaking like that. the hr didnt reply, so i figured it either wasnt of any importance to them or the hr team


[07-Oct-20 09:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
Wow, that isn't acceptable.


[07-Oct-20 09:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
All MR reports should be replied to, period.


[07-Oct-20 09:08 AM] courtney#5125
idk might be silly but it can be kind of discouraging bc  you feel like it really wasnt important (whether its leaking or any other situation), and people might think that they shouldnt dm hrs about similar situations that occur from then on, if they feel like it doesnt meet the standards of importance


[07-Oct-20 09:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Activity wise, idk. I feel like the HR team we have now is pretty good activity wise, I think we're in a better shape now than past years atleast. We do have to get better with the management board though, i agree with dat


[07-Oct-20 09:09 AM] courtney#5125
i agree, theres only a few of us that are inactive. and the session board is somewhat full, sometimes not tho but that could just be a lack of hrs since theres only like 6 shift managers. but yes as the months and years have gone on the management board seemed to just get more neglected


[07-Oct-20 09:10 AM] stacey#1000
It would help I guess if all of us cleared bans when we can, not just through banning sessions so it‚Äôs done more


[07-Oct-20 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
How many bans are there rn?


[07-Oct-20 09:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
I agree, y'all current HRs are amazing in what you do. We're a strong team right now.


[07-Oct-20 09:12 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey MB is full, 100+ on the overflow board.


[07-Oct-20 09:13 AM] stacey#1000
Ya that‚Äôs a lot


[07-Oct-20 09:13 AM] courtney#5125
jesus mary and joseph


[07-Oct-20 09:14 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn so when imag DMs you I think you should give her a quick response like ‚Äúok‚Äù or something so she knows you saw it

well that's something we allll should do!!


[07-Oct-20 09:15 AM] stacey#1000
She said you never reply to anything so for serious matters she wouldn‚Äôt dm you because you don‚Äôt reply


[07-Oct-20 09:15 AM] courtney#5125
if we want to make improvements, it has to be done as a team


[07-Oct-20 09:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
Regarding the MB; we've always had the Management Board be forgotten about, currently and in the past, and I guess it's just one of those things. Regardless of whether we had a full team or whether we had a small team, it's always kind of been forgotten about at times. Maybe if there was some sort of guidelines, don't really wanna put on a requirement as I don't think it's needed at this time, but a guideline where each HR should check-up on the Management Board every few days. Might help, idk. But yeah it does seem to get neglected at times.


[07-Oct-20 09:16 AM] stacey#1000
Yes I‚Äôve always been bad at looking at manager board


[07-Oct-20 09:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey Well I mean yes, but I can't be expected to reply to every single DM sent by her as she literally spams me with DMs at times (not literally, but like she DMs me a lot). If she DM'd me with a serious matter, I would reply. And just because I don't reply doesn't mean I never saw the DM, it'd help if she understood that from my perspective as someone who is DM'd a lot.


[07-Oct-20 09:17 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôll tell her to keep that in mind


[07-Oct-20 09:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alright, that'd help


[07-Oct-20 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn how to get less DMs: be fake offline like me


[07-Oct-20 09:19 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[07-Oct-20 09:19 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[07-Oct-20 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
I only go on online when I‚Äôm on pc


[07-Oct-20 09:19 AM] courtney#5125
do what bonnie does and say if they dm u they get blocked...!!


[07-Oct-20 09:20 AM] stacey#1000
When I‚Äôm on mobile like rn I on offline


[07-Oct-20 09:20 AM] courtney#5125
its kind of extreme but u gotta do what u gotta do


[07-Oct-20 09:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'd do what Bonnie does but then people will be scared to DM me, and that's not gonna help if there's an MR report or a serious matter, etc.


[07-Oct-20 09:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'll just try to reply to DMs when I can, but serious matters will be prioritized.


[07-Oct-20 09:20 AM] ethan;#0003
if seniors where allowed to pban half of her document would be solved


[07-Oct-20 09:21 AM] stacey#1000
Oh another thing about the inactivity thing, I talked to imag about it and she said the limit of one month should be increased to 2 months


[07-Oct-20 09:21 AM] stacey#1000
If shift managers got super admin to host banning sessions it would also help


[07-Oct-20 09:21 AM] stacey#1000
But shift managers when you can you should clear bans. Not all of them but like do a bit because you do get admin


[07-Oct-20 09:22 AM] xM_inn#2821
The 1 month thing is only a check-up, if you're not able to give a notice every month in regards to your inactivity status then that's concerning. I'm still not a fan of that. We introduced the 1 month thing to combat people violating our activity standards and if we upgrade it to 2 months, that's not really solving the problem on our side.


[07-Oct-20 09:22 AM] courtney#5125
i dont think allowing more power to seniors would help, just imo


[07-Oct-20 09:22 AM] courtney#5125
the hr team needs to put more effort into it, the last thing we need to do is push all of our banning responsibilities on another team


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
I feel like seniors already have enough duties and responsibilities, don't wanna over-work them


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] courtney#5125
that makes 0 improvements, it just makes us seem lazy


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
Boy, we're gonna have a lot to discuss in the next meeting LOL.


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] stacey#1000
We could host HR banning sessions where only HRs clear bans


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] courtney#5125
that would be FUN. nice BONDING TIME


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] xM_inn#2821

[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] courtney#5125
WOO


[07-Oct-20 09:23 AM] courtney#5125
i like the way u think stacey


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] ethan;#0003
i hate banning


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] ethan;#0003
so much


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'll ban u ethan


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] ethan;#0003
its SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] ethan;#0003
BORING


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] ethan;#0003
i get distracted when i do it


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] ethan;#0003
and then i forget im supposed to be banning people


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn imag said she DMed you a report or something once about an HR or MR and you didn‚Äôt reply


[07-Oct-20 09:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ask her when.


[07-Oct-20 09:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
I don't see any recently, but let me double check.


[07-Oct-20 09:25 AM] ethan;#0003
the other day i told imag to ask once when asking to host and not to respond with ? ? ? every 3 minutes


[07-Oct-20 09:25 AM] ethan;#0003
because i dont respond right away


[07-Oct-20 09:25 AM] ethan;#0003
and after 5 minutes i would get 3 messages


[07-Oct-20 09:25 AM] ethan;#0003
and i look in order of who dm'ed first


[07-Oct-20 09:25 AM] ethan;#0003
and her dm is on the top because she messaged multiple times


[07-Oct-20 09:37 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Only thing i would catch myself doing is walking over things at trainings like chairs and lines but not on purpose but because i get bored and forget im at trainings


[07-Oct-20 09:37 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But i havent used admin to teleport people constantly


[07-Oct-20 09:37 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Barely use the bring command at all


[07-Oct-20 09:38 AM] stacey#1000
@Polk imag says you don‚Äôt reply to her DMs


[07-Oct-20 09:38 AM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX I think that part like we can have fun still and I‚Äôve never noticed any of us being really really unprofessional


[07-Oct-20 09:39 AM] stacey#1000
We don‚Äôt have to be like robots


[07-Oct-20 09:39 AM] stacey#1000
That part I disagreed with reading it so ya


[07-Oct-20 09:40 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean i have fun, but in vc, i dont express it in game tho


[07-Oct-20 09:40 AM] stacey#1000
Yea that‚Äôs fine


[07-Oct-20 09:40 AM] KjRBLX#2053
> We could host HR banning sessions where only HRs clear bans
@stacey  i like this idea


[07-Oct-20 09:40 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I was thinking about it before i read


[07-Oct-20 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
I think it would be really fun


[07-Oct-20 09:41 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Because she say 5 minutes, but 5 minutes isn‚Äôt enough time to clear out suspension list by yourself


[07-Oct-20 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah it‚Äôs a lot to do anything on your own for the board. But I guess even taking 10 mins to clear 20-40 bans when you can helps too


[07-Oct-20 09:42 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve always been bad for looking at the board


[07-Oct-20 09:42 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I tend to look at it, but i would maybe hold it off til tomorrow


[07-Oct-20 09:43 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Maybe we should just start doing things in pairs


[07-Oct-20 09:43 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs a good idea. If 2 people worked on clearing suspensions, etc it would help


[07-Oct-20 09:43 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah


[07-Oct-20 09:48 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk get ur fellow online hr to help with clearing a bulk list

like i appreciate it but i dont reply to that stuff


[07-Oct-20 09:56 AM] Polk#1596
i dont rlly have time to host banning sessions anymore, as i already host 4 sessions a week and that is what i have time for


[07-Oct-20 09:56 AM] Polk#1596
but if she asks me to host then i always reply because then im ready for dms


[07-Oct-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
1. management board is full 2. rushing me to get the management board done which isnt as easy as she probably thinks it is https://gyazo.com/0198d5db4f63c6175adb3c356e7ba69e

[07-Oct-20 10:01 AM] Polk#1596
anywho, the letter from imag is very well written


[07-Oct-20 10:01 AM] courtney#5125
she also does ask very very


[07-Oct-20 10:01 AM] courtney#5125
simple questions


[07-Oct-20 10:01 AM] Polk#1596
i dont agree with some points she made but i like to see what she has done


[07-Oct-20 10:01 AM] courtney#5125
that a senior should absolutely know


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
yes, its not worth our time anymore


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] courtney#5125
its just odd to me. idk i dont think she can do much without someone holding her hand all the way through :/


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs not an HR rn


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
its like questions u would have them (a management or whatever) be directed to a senior


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
but shes the senior


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
so


[07-Oct-20 10:03 AM] Polk#1596
and about the management board, i know its dead so thats why im doing the update to it


[07-Oct-20 10:03 AM] Polk#1596
and i'll enforce new policies about it to the HR team, which we can discuss in meetings when i have decided on some


[07-Oct-20 10:03 AM] Polk#1596
such as like checking it every now and then but more detailed


[07-Oct-20 10:04 AM] stacey#1000
We got stuff to discuss at meeting now


[07-Oct-20 10:04 AM] courtney#5125
yessss


[07-Oct-20 10:05 AM] courtney#5125
i also want to discuss the mr training kinda thing i brought up a few weeks ago


[07-Oct-20 10:05 AM] courtney#5125
i wrote out a few ideas so ill bring them up then


[07-Oct-20 10:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
you know if we ever hired imag as an hr she would do a really good job on clearing the boards but unfortunately she lacks a lot on other things


[07-Oct-20 10:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
which is


[07-Oct-20 10:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
a shame


[07-Oct-20 10:06 AM] courtney#5125
she has that one good quality but she completely lacks any means of being independent and being a leader


[07-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Polk#1596
very true


[07-Oct-20 10:14 AM] Polk#1596
what i have gathered from this, excluding the bad arguments about stuff like HR activity, she is complaining about how we pass down the work to lower ranks (aka having seniors ban)


[07-Oct-20 10:14 AM] Polk#1596
and i totally get that, we used to do it all the time


[07-Oct-20 10:15 AM] Polk#1596
personally i did 300+ admin acts every week as a shift/gm


[07-Oct-20 10:15 AM] Polk#1596
letting the seniors help allowed us to relax a lot more and focus on more things


[07-Oct-20 10:15 AM] Polk#1596
but i do admit that we have gotten a little lazy and just keep using them while expecting them to do all the work, at least thats what i see


[07-Oct-20 10:16 AM] Polk#1596
but i think that can be easily fixed, which will be discussed in a future meeting about management board stuff


[07-Oct-20 10:17 AM] courtney#5125
üôå


[07-Oct-20 10:17 AM] courtney#5125
very good points


[07-Oct-20 10:33 AM] Fraux#7971
i definitely agree with some of the points as well, and i take accountability for not doing as much as i should on the board and stuff but im just so busy with school and work it‚Äôs crzy:/


[07-Oct-20 10:43 AM] Fraux#7971
and not only do i agree with the maturity of HRs at sessions, but i also feel in the discord there is a certain level , that being you should not randomly warn for fake stuff just for fun, because the MRs get reprimanded when they do so

[07-Oct-20 11:29 AM] Fraux#7971
what about Dallas


[07-Oct-20 11:41 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah, Imag brought up a lot of good points. I do agree that I tend to lack on viewing the management board, which is something I‚Äôll improve more on. Personally right now, I‚Äôm just really busy with school and tests coming up, but I‚Äôll find some time to do the little things. But like I said, she did bring up some valid points. Some points where I don‚Äôt necessarily agree but yeah.


[07-Oct-20 12:15 PM] impact#0297
Imag is female? The fuck.


[07-Oct-20 12:17 PM] impact#0297

@impact I most likely won't be able to go to the meeting, I'm about to get slammed by another hurricane again so I'm most likely going to be evacuating so I won't be home :/

ive seen this happen for 3 years now. if we hire a new shift, yes they will do management board checks but after a few weeks, they will get bored like you, me and every hr has done. the only way on fixing management board activity is just volunteering ourselves

@courtney probs will still get a new shift in the next month if this vote doesnt pass


[09-Oct-20 11:12 AM] Polk#1596
well i just quickly skimmed through the managements and i dont see anyone that stands out that much


[09-Oct-20 11:12 AM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez how long has he been manager?


[09-Oct-20 11:12 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Since May

[09-Oct-20 11:12 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah his activity is consistent


[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] katie#0200
What about mendo


[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] bonnie591#0591

[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yay


[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] Polk#1596
i will change my vote to only 1 senior so my vote matters


[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] courtney#5125
yes maybe 1 senior for right now


[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] courtney#5125
if so i vote jj or willow


[09-Oct-20 11:13 AM] courtney#5125
and a shift later in the month or whatever happens idk


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
if its 1 senior i will vote jj


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
2 id vote jj and willow


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] Polk#1596
im not sure if we need another shift yet, like maybe in december or when 2021 comes along


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] Polk#1596
and i have honestly no idea which senior we would promote anyway


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Lyss duh!!!


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] courtney#5125
werent we just talking abt lyss


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
have we ever thought of "departments"


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
of public works


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] Polk#1596
of corrections


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
like hrs are set on what they do


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] courtney#5125
shes been a senior for over a year and in the past like 6-7 months shes been really consistent


[09-Oct-20 11:14 AM] ethan;#0003
other groups do that


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lyss is really active so she definitely has my vote next vote


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] courtney#5125
s a m e


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] katie#0200

[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] courtney#5125
i feel like shed just click here


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596
well personally i think departments are awesome but we have never had any problems with how we do things


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] ethan;#0003
lyss = next senior


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] courtney#5125

you mean shift LOL


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
ive thought about hrs having a certain thing to do will be more organised but doing the same thing over and over again can get boring so


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] courtney#5125
so how do u suppose we go back in time..?


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] ethan;#0003
SHIFT


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
actually


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
@shift manager go manage shifts now


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596
that too


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
@general manager manage general stuff


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
@board of directors play stapleton


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596
its just an unneccesary change


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] courtney#5125
..


[09-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596
i would love to


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] courtney#5125
i think groups like boba can pull off departments really well but


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 What other groups do is that is changes


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] courtney#5125
i just cant see us doing something like that, we all kind of do  everything


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] ethan;#0003
like the people swap what they do


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] ethan;#0003
every week or so


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
same candy


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
do is that is changes


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] Polk#1596
dont we basically do that already


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] Polk#1596
one HR gets a report, they mainly deal with it and others help


[09-Oct-20 11:16 AM] Polk#1596
we all get work


[09-Oct-20 11:17 AM] ethan;#0003
ya ig just was an idea


[09-Oct-20 11:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
@courtney why r u not managing shifts!


[09-Oct-20 11:17 AM] Polk#1596
not a bad idea but i think bloxton can do without it


[09-Oct-20 11:17 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
do we have a meeting tomorrow


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] courtney#5125
going back to waht u said abt hiring a shift in 2021 or december @Polk lyss has been a senior for over a year and yes ik shes really dedicated but making ppl wait for so many months can do a toll on their confidence and overall activity, as we saw with holly


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] courtney#5125
@bonnie591 why are u not boarding the directors


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
i was wondering this for a while are hrs supposed to do regular shifts at the hotel


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
like weekly go on shifts


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] Polk#1596
i announce myself as the board of director being the director of shift managers handling shifts


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] courtney#5125
are u can just announce urself as "polk"


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] courtney#5125
:monkey_surrender:


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] courtney#5125
*or


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
becus i dont do shifts they are so boring üòê


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] Polk#1596
hm, well i'll have to investigate further


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] Polk#1596
lyss is a good candidate though


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] Polk#1596
i know that


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
yes


[09-Oct-20 11:18 AM] ethan;#0003
lyss for next shift!!


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
or when we fire candy


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
we can replace her


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
with lyss


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] Polk#1596
but i was a senior for 1 year and 3 months i dont feel bad if people have to wait!


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
same person tbh


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
i was senior for like


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think promoting other people over them makes a toll on their confidence an activity. as long as we dont promote others then lyss should probably still be good with activity


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
over 2 years


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] Polk#1596
ethan was a noob senior


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] Polk#1596
i remember that


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
with holly, a lot of people got promoted before her


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] courtney#5125
ehtans still a noob shift


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] ethan;#0003
i remember i would always think i would get introuble


[09-Oct-20 11:19 AM] courtney#5125
yeah i think thats obviously happening with marissa now too @bonnie591


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
so i just stopped talking to people because i would think i would be getting myself introuble


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] courtney#5125
except idm bc she hasnt been close to senior anyways


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
omg when i was manager


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] Polk#1596
i dont think others got promoted over me until i got to senior


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
i was so bad


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
i got introuble...


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
i got suspended ...

[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] Polk#1596
then i got HR and it got better!


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003
i told mallory to die


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] ethan;#0003

at the training center


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] bonnie591#0591
it can be very disheartening due to the competition now for senior and shift


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] courtney#5125
@Polk better for whom? üòÉ


[09-Oct-20 11:20 AM] Polk#1596

If a Former MR was saying a racist slur in another gc, would they have their former role taken?


[09-Oct-20 09:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm not sure, I've seen a glimpse of cases of peopel being punished for actions done elsewhere.


[09-Oct-20 09:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053

didn't think so..


[10-Oct-20 05:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah it'd be risky removing their role since it isnt in the Bloxton Discord nor relevant to us, keep an eye out for his behaviour in the Bloxton Discord though.

[10-Oct-20 01:33 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Honestly the CBs are the least of my worries, because I think they *want* to be banned just so they can come back and create a new account. I've said this before but wouldn't it be better to leave them alone, the majority of them are harmless. (obviously cursing, etc would not be categorized under this)


[10-Oct-20 01:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[10-Oct-20 01:34 PM] stacey#1000
To ban


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
> Yeah we could stop banning for being a cb
@stacey I agree, it also gets rid of people asking if someone's a CB or not


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
seniors have admin???


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@here Would is be possible for us to go to a trial period where we dont ban a CB until they're proven guilty for each account they make/have and see how that goes?


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
and i never know because theres so many CBs


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh wait


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
u mean :ban command


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
Minn seniors can server ban


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
i thought u meant admin as in shift manager+ admin


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
uh


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
i can try


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] Polk#1596
we already did that once, but sure


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Some CBs join the game, and they're instantly banned for "being a CB"- for their previous actions. How about we refrain from taking action until proven guilty?


[10-Oct-20 01:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
@impact i can but i have to scroll a little


[10-Oct-20 01:36 PM] Polk#1596
oh yeah


[10-Oct-20 01:36 PM] Polk#1596
so the ban list was still filled up


[10-Oct-20 01:36 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@here Also I trust you all enough, so I'll definitely be willing to say yes to the shifts getting super admin


[10-Oct-20 01:36 PM] impact#0297
I'd be interested in seeing the result of having this CB trial period, as long as Seniors are aware and have been given relaxed rules on banning CB.


[10-Oct-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes


[10-Oct-20 01:36 PM] Polk#1596

[10-Oct-20 01:42 PM] anna#0004
yes school is great i dont go in much tho cuz corona... anyways this was brought to my attention a while ago now but i know that a few people are upset with rule 19 (English server only). anyway some people are getting banned for just saying like "bonjour" so idk maybe we should revamp the rule a little, make it more clear what we're actually banning for because that means they have to wait a whole month, send an appeal, wait for it to be acknowledged etc just for saying a single word in another language


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
I agree anna


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Oh no way! I don't think that's ban-worthy though.


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Agree


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] ethan;#0003
people dont understand that speaking in another language isnt trolling üòê


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
agree


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
Bonjour/Hola/etc shouldn't be bannable


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] impact#0297
Ok -- let's change the definition on the rule here.


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] stacey#1000
They should only get banned if they swear in another language


[10-Oct-20 01:43 PM] impact#0297
Perhaps swearing in the other language or ..?

What if we remove rule 19 as a whole and just note in rule 2 that swearing in a different language will lead to a ban as well?


[10-Oct-20 01:44 PM] impact#0297
Sounds good with me.

[10-Oct-20 01:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so i have one thing, with seniors inactivity ive noticed that some of their notices go over 1 month. now i believe we have that its only 1 month in advanced where you can say you're going to be inactive but some of them have them in December and late November. so is it 1 month or how long do we let them be on an inactivity notice

They can be on notice as long as they want but

They have to check-in every month

Greetings Doqee,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been demoted from your position as Senior Management to Receptionist at Bloxton Hotels as of 10/10/2020. The reasoning behind your demotion is due to the following reason:

 Major Inactivity

As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a demotion in order to ensure our company is running at the best it can. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

Bloo_Berriez
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels

@everyone 

:bloxton3: **NOTICE OF DEMOTION** :bloxton3: 

Greetings Bloxton MRs,

As part of our agreement to be transparent with demotions, I regret to inform you all that Doqee has been demoted from his position as Senior Management here at Bloxton Hotels down to his former LR positions due to inactivity within the company. At Bloxton, if you're inactive for a long amount of time (usually months) without a valid reason or notice, we will begin investigating the situation and taking appropriate action. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this demotion, feel free to DM a member of the High-Rank Team. Please also remember that you may not leak this demotion to any non-MRs as that'd be leaking which can and will result in an instant termination from your position. Have a nice evening everyone.

Best regards,

xM_inn
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels

**__Once an HR finishes promotion rules with a head, they should:__**

1) Tell the newly promoted head that they are *required* to go through an MR training.
       - The training will include the following....
               ‚Ä¢ Supervise at least 1 training session (will not count towards attendance, 
                 Senior should be aware of this).
               ‚Ä¢ Supervise at least 1 interview session (will not count towards attendance, 
                  Seniors should be aware of this). 

This is simply to ensure that the head is in complete understanding of what their new responsibilities will be.

2) Tell the newly promoted head that they are encouraged [but NOT required] to go through a 5 question quiz on the things they were just taught.
    - This quiz will include the following.....
(*Note: Standardized questions, questions not to be customized for HR's preference)*
       **ALL QUESTIONS ARE DRAFTS, SUBJECT TO CHANGE)**
              ‚Ä¢ Name 3 commands you are NOT permitted to use ever.
              ‚Ä¢ What must you do once someone receives 3 warnings?
              ‚Ä¢ TRUE or FALSE? You are permitted to kick abusive staff members without 
                 permission.
              ‚Ä¢ Instead of kicking someone without permission, name one thing you should 
                do instead.
              ‚Ä¢ What will leaking always result in?

[10-Oct-20 02:24 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I think we should have standards for blacklists because some trello cards will say DO NOT APPEAL and then they eventually get appealed, so I think we should have like a set time before they can appeal or just make it so that they can not appeal.. somethin like that


[10-Oct-20 02:25 PM] Polk#1596
thats a good point


[10-Oct-20 02:26 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey yeah lucas was what made me think of that, but there have been other instances of people that have had do not appeal have gotten appealed is what im saying


[10-Oct-20 02:28 PM] katie#0200
@Bloo_Berriez i think mendo was promoted on march 1st not may 1st

While we're talking about senior activity i think its worth looking out for megan and drew in the future, stacey mentioned this a couple weeks back but megan rarely goes to sessions and when she does its only staceys sessions usually, and ive seen her on roblox before. Her inactivity is still rather recent though so maybe we can still give it more time and wait a  couple months but that's something I was thinking about. Drew has been inactive for a while as well, but he has an inactivity notice saying his computer is broken (ive seen him on roblox as well but it couldve been his moms computer or whatever) but those are 2 seniors i wanna look out for in the coming months i guess, their inactivity isnt as extreme as doges though so theyre not as important but yeah

It raises concerns for more drama happening since a lot of formers have proved they don‚Äôt deserve it something like that


[10-Oct-20 03:27 PM] impact#0297
That's a good one.

bro why do they care so much about a channel LOL


[10-Oct-20 04:45 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they can always make their own group chats or have their own server where they invite their friends

even connor our management


[10-Oct-20 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
i dont get why they take it so extremely seriously like jesus christ


[10-Oct-20 04:55 PM] impact#0297
I honestly don't care.


[10-Oct-20 04:55 PM] impact#0297
I wanted to have a former chat but it's not fucking happening under my watch anymore.


[10-Oct-20 04:58 PM] impact#0297
@Polk what they saying


[10-Oct-20 04:59 PM] Polk#1596
1. ryan is so immature, he shouldnt have done it that way, emma has a "whole novel" of things u did or something, yada yada


[10-Oct-20 04:59 PM] Polk#1596
2. they are blaming it on the former hr lounge, thats why we are not getting a former mr chat


[10-Oct-20 04:59 PM] Polk#1596
mainly emma is speaking


[10-Oct-20 05:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Emma who?


[10-Oct-20 05:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@KjRBLX former hr


[10-Oct-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
Toxic formers


[10-Oct-20 05:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Emma said #2?

[10-Oct-20 05:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ik emma


[10-Oct-20 05:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But emma said #2 of what polk said?


[10-Oct-20 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
You should make a statement that they‚Äôre behavior is literally showing the reason that their not getting a channel


[10-Oct-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
^^


[10-Oct-20 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Maybe in the future if they act better


[10-Oct-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
Is Emma trying to help or is she making things worse?


[10-Oct-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm not home so


[10-Oct-20 05:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im at the mall and im kinda lost


[10-Oct-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk is Emma helping or like siding with the former MRs?


[10-Oct-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
yeah she said both


[10-Oct-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
she is siding with former MRs


[10-Oct-20 05:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Chile


[10-Oct-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
the only thing she said that was not completely siding with the former mrs was


[10-Oct-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
"im sure cyto wants a former mr chat, he probably didnt lie about that"


[10-Oct-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
but she is literally the main person talking


[10-Oct-20 05:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Only if i was at home


[10-Oct-20 05:21 PM] Polk#1596
im talking in general to make it not all about the "debate"


[10-Oct-20 05:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053

I mean we knew this would happen


[10-Oct-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
They are just proving my point of more drama would happen and they can‚Äôt be trusted. Legit former MRs are worse then cbs in ways


[10-Oct-20 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
Not all of them but a good handful

[10-Oct-20 05:35 PM] Polk#1596
the biggest thing i dont understand is why trey and emma wants to side with the former MRs


[10-Oct-20 05:35 PM] Polk#1596
like im pretty sure they were against it the whole time as an HR?


[10-Oct-20 05:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I feel like they were against the idea of former mr lounge when they were HRs but i dont remember


[10-Oct-20 05:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah


[10-Oct-20 05:35 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i think so @Polk


[10-Oct-20 05:36 PM] Polk#1596
obviously the others dont know that so it feels like they are making themselves seem like big heroes because they are standing up for "all the former MRs"


[10-Oct-20 05:36 PM] Polk#1596
and ikr tatto


[10-Oct-20 05:36 PM] Polk#1596
she aint an HR anymore


[10-Oct-20 05:36 PM] Polk#1596
she doesnt know


[10-Oct-20 05:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
‚ÄúLook around, your raging over a non-existent channel, you‚Äôre just proving our point.‚Äù


[10-Oct-20 05:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I wanted to say that so bad


[10-Oct-20 05:37 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they're all gonna attak u if u do @KjRBLX üíÄ


[10-Oct-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
Emma and trey were against a former lounge


[10-Oct-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
And they really think they can change it now?


[10-Oct-20 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
I remember them voting no on it


[10-Oct-20 05:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Literally the thing is...former mr chat will be general but without like lrs who havent been mr before and people got their former taken away

[10-Oct-20 06:04 PM] courtney#5125

[10-Oct-20 06:06 PM] courtney#5125

[10-Oct-20 06:06 PM] courtney#5125
her and mel were really good friends


[10-Oct-20 06:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well, time to start breaking out the promo suggestions


[10-Oct-20 06:07 PM] courtney#5125
if we promote heads immediately then formers will get mad that they‚Äôre being replaced


[10-Oct-20 06:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Just do it one at time ig...but  operations cant stop because of feelings


[10-Oct-20 06:09 PM] courtney#5125
ik but we don‚Äôt need to be hated more than we already are by the formers


[10-Oct-20 06:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah eventually we'll have to. but we already fired doqee and we got a vote up currently so lol


[10-Oct-20 06:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
its nothin newww


[10-Oct-20 06:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They cant get mad at us because they resigned...


[10-Oct-20 06:11 PM] courtney#5125
im not saying that, but it‚Äôs not like we need to replace the heads immediately. we have enough as it is


[10-Oct-20 06:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
We dont have to do it instantly..just have your cards ready to play


[10-Oct-20 06:12 PM] courtney#5125
im not saying to stop operations, im only saying it‚Äôs not like we need to immediately fill in positions right at this very moment


[10-Oct-20 06:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah we have a lot of heads atm so theres no rush for new ones


[10-Oct-20 06:12 PM] courtney#5125
that‚Äôs what im saying yes


[10-Oct-20 06:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Resigning over not getting a former MR channel..


[10-Oct-20 06:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@xM_inn i think that is what it is.. lol, r4ses was in vc earlier talking about how we couldve given it a trial run


[10-Oct-20 06:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
its definetly over former mr channel for r4ses atleast, idk about the other ones that resigned


[10-Oct-20 06:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
üíÄ üíÄ


[10-Oct-20 06:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly ridiculous, but if they want to resign over not getting a **Discord channel** that isn't even relevant to them as a current MR then let them


[10-Oct-20 06:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
Keep clicking enter too early oopsies


[10-Oct-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Wait what


[10-Oct-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They are resigning over that


[10-Oct-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs so dumb


[10-Oct-20 06:15 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They are trying to use that as leverage against us to make one


[10-Oct-20 06:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ig they gon hang out in GD most of the time...


[10-Oct-20 06:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Cuz only former mr channel ik is the non existent one


[10-Oct-20 06:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And u cant type there or see anything


[10-Oct-20 06:28 PM] emily#4444

[10-Oct-20 06:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Noooooooooo


[10-Oct-20 06:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
She‚Äôs appealed previously, hasn‚Äôt she?


[10-Oct-20 06:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And then she was banned again


[10-Oct-20 06:31 PM] courtney#5125
baby or bear banned swan from the disc and they haven‚Äôt responded abt if she‚Äôs able to appeal or not


[10-Oct-20 06:32 PM] emily#4444
ooh right


[10-Oct-20 06:32 PM] emily#4444
i think she‚Äôs been banned twice before


[10-Oct-20 06:35 PM] courtney#5125
i think so yes!!


[10-Oct-20 06:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yeah I don‚Äôt trust her tbh


[10-Oct-20 06:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Causes way too much drama


[10-Oct-20 06:48 PM] bonnie591#0591

@impact really?


[10-Oct-20 07:14 PM] Tattoblue#5828

Ofc he wants to do that for the drama


[10-Oct-20 07:32 PM] impact#0297
I can't make this shit up honestly.


[10-Oct-20 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
He really thought he wouldn‚Äôt get fired for being inactive?


[10-Oct-20 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
His own fault


[10-Oct-20 07:32 PM] Tattoblue#5828

We don‚Äôt want you on the team if you ain‚Äôt going to contribute

>senior manager, inactive
>gets fired
>complains about being fired
>now complains about how formers don't get a chatroom because he was fired
>claims he resigned to help be popular with the former people


[10-Oct-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
Ya that won‚Äôt last long for him


[10-Oct-20 07:33 PM] impact#0297
"oh a MR channel would be so active"


[10-Oct-20 07:33 PM] impact#0297
"then go make your own fucking server"


[10-Oct-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
Omg did MRs legit resign over no former channel.


[10-Oct-20 07:34 PM] impact#0297
"but it's not the same!!!"


[10-Oct-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
Sorry but that shit is funny


[10-Oct-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
Resigning over no former channel


[10-Oct-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
More people will just get promoted at some point. People resign all the time so it doesn‚Äôt make a difference


[10-Oct-20 07:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can see why they want it so bad but that‚Äôs an extra channel to moderate


[10-Oct-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah they proved today why they will never get one


[10-Oct-20 07:42 PM] impact#0297
I honestly want to do this.


[10-Oct-20 07:42 PM] impact#0297
I want to make a Former Chat, but have a shit ton of bots on the highest sensitivity to swearing, slurs, etc


[10-Oct-20 07:42 PM] impact#0297
If there is ONE infraction, the bot bans.


[10-Oct-20 07:42 PM] impact#0297
No questions asked.


[10-Oct-20 07:43 PM] stacey#1000
I will forever vote no to a former chat


[10-Oct-20 07:43 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs just my opinion


[10-Oct-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
Too many formers have proved they don‚Äôt deserve it


[10-Oct-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
I honestly would be open to the following:

1) Trial for two weeks, bots ban the people who violate rules
2) People who survived, who are mostly good formers, get to stay.


[10-Oct-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
Would need a vote for that


[10-Oct-20 07:44 PM] impact#0297
But ultimately, and how I was treated today, I will probably say no from now on.


[10-Oct-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
This is why I forever vote no


[10-Oct-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
The formers always treat people like crap. Not all of them but most of them


[10-Oct-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
And they ruin it for all of them


[10-Oct-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
They get this mindset when they resign that they can do what they want when they resign


[10-Oct-20 07:46 PM] impact#0297
"Oh Sizzleburger has a successful chatroom for Former MR's"


[10-Oct-20 07:46 PM] impact#0297
"Yea cause Sizzleburger is fucking DEAD"


[10-Oct-20 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
We ain‚Äôt SizzleBurger


[10-Oct-20 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
Not to mention we are a larger community as well


[10-Oct-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
Plus I can tell you a good few formers are in the cb server and trash talk


[10-Oct-20 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
I witnessed that myself


[10-Oct-20 08:30 PM] impact#0297
does anyone remember how many people resigned after emma and trey were fired


[10-Oct-20 08:31 PM] impact#0297
I'm making a probability that a MR will resign per announcement metric


[10-Oct-20 08:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
4 HRs i think resigned @impact


[10-Oct-20 08:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
idk how much MRs resigned


[10-Oct-20 08:56 PM] Tattoblue#5828
its funny how doqee barely talked in the discord server before he got demoted and now all of a sudden he starts talkinn üíÄ


[10-Oct-20 09:00 PM] impact#0297
Damn, everytime we do a controversial announcement. There is a 22% chance that exactly 2 people will resign.


[10-Oct-20 09:00 PM] impact#0297
14% chance that exactly 1 person will resign.


[10-Oct-20 09:00 PM] impact#0297
22% of 3 people resigning.


[10-Oct-20 09:03 PM] Polk#1596

[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] Polk#1596
the he took over for the rest of the patrol


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] Polk#1596
NO


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
omg polk i rlly regret resigning from divine when i join back i wont be aide anymore :aPES_Tears:


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
BUT


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
activity is less strict i think


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
as trainee


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
so


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
idk


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
complicated


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think u drove off a cliff sir


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] Polk#1596
was it more stict as an aide


[11-Oct-20 09:49 AM] Polk#1596
strict


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] Polk#1596
i thought it was basically the same requirements


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
well


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
it might be but


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think they are less strict with trainees


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
since theres more of them


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
but idk


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
i rlly needed a retraining but aides dont get tagged for training


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
and i didnt like when people wanted to shadow me it was annoying


[11-Oct-20 09:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
i just wanna work there


[11-Oct-20 09:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
it would be cool to become high ranked thoo but i dont have tiem


[11-Oct-20 09:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
time


[11-Oct-20 09:51 AM] Polk#1596
u needed a retraining?


[11-Oct-20 09:51 AM] Polk#1596
u were so good at the job


[11-Oct-20 09:51 AM] Polk#1596
yea


[11-Oct-20 09:51 AM] Polk#1596
bloxton and stapleton for life!


[11-Oct-20 09:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think i just needed a refresher because i was starting to do some things rong


[11-Oct-20 09:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
and yaaa


[11-Oct-20 09:52 AM] bonnie591#0591
one day maybe ill try and become a higher rank


[11-Oct-20 09:56 AM] Polk#1596
what things did u do wrong @bonnie591


[11-Oct-20 09:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
well nothing bad i just


[11-Oct-20 09:56 AM] Polk#1596
if u did some things wrong i dont even wanna know what ive done LOL


[11-Oct-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
didnt know how to do some things correctly and its embarrassing when an aide gets told to do something better


[11-Oct-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think rules just change


[11-Oct-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
over time


[11-Oct-20 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
like giving holy water when hands are down only


[11-Oct-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
oh


[11-Oct-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
yeah i get that


[11-Oct-20 09:58 AM] Polk#1596
it was kinda scary cuz people are very judgemental there sometimes


[11-Oct-20 10:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
it would be cool to be a hr there but


[11-Oct-20 10:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
u would have to

dedicate your whole life to it pretty much


[11-Oct-20 10:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
and apparently the hrs get attacked a lot


[11-Oct-20 10:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
i feel bad for them theres only 5 silver ranks


[11-Oct-20 10:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
they should really promote some of them to gold ranks by now


[11-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
dont we get attacked a lot too? üòî


[11-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
yes


[11-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
thats like having 3 sergeants for 6 units


[11-Oct-20 10:02 AM] Polk#1596
not good!


[11-Oct-20 10:03 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok but its really bad there


[11-Oct-20 10:03 AM] bonnie591#0591
they are all LGBTQ+ and they get a lot of attacks because of that


[11-Oct-20 10:03 AM] bonnie591#0591
and in a hrs recent resignation they got sent death threats, porn etc


[11-Oct-20 10:03 AM] bonnie591#0591
so


[11-Oct-20 10:08 AM] Polk#1596
well ive gotten those things before too


[11-Oct-20 10:08 AM] Polk#1596
but not as often i guess


[11-Oct-20 10:08 AM] Polk#1596
yea it doesnt sound very tempting with all of those things going on

Doge's Departure from Bloxton Hotels
Doge‚Äôs Departure Letter 10th of October   The time has finally arrived, my departure from Bloxton Hotels as a Senior Management, on the date, 10th of October, 2020. This may upset some, and this may excite some, but it doesn't matter to whom I'm writing this to, as we're all d...

[11-Oct-20 10:47 AM] courtney#5125
am I the only one slightly confused as to why he clearly uses a thesaurus for so many of the words he uses.... a lot of his comments on they senior board on suggestions just didn‚Äôt make sense


[11-Oct-20 10:47 AM] courtney#5125
to each their own i suppose


[11-Oct-20 10:50 AM] stacey#1000
Bruh he was on roblox studio for a lot longer then ‚Äúbriefly‚Äù


[11-Oct-20 10:56 AM] stacey#1000
Oh well


[11-Oct-20 10:56 AM] courtney#5125
no kidding


[11-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596
this just cancels out everything he said about how he disagreed with the decision "To be honest, it doesn't have an impact on me, as I predicted it to happen, but still, it's surprising for me even though I was expected to have a fair inactivity notice before I came on the track."


[11-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596
"i predicted it to happen"


[11-Oct-20 11:15 AM] Polk#1596

apparently an MR


[11-Oct-20 01:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
is DMing all MRs


[11-Oct-20 01:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
with a survey sort of thing


[11-Oct-20 01:31 PM] xM_inn#2821

Which MRs are all doing it?


[11-Oct-20 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
Should we speak to them or something idk not much we can do


[11-Oct-20 02:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
I've already DM'd jackson


[11-Oct-20 02:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
I just want to know his intentions


[11-Oct-20 02:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cause at first they said they're going to tell us the HRs the answers... yet none of us know yet


[11-Oct-20 02:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
And now they're saying its a secret??


[11-Oct-20 02:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
Kinda sus


[11-Oct-20 02:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
So far all I know is Jackson and Maddy r doing it


[11-Oct-20 02:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
So


[11-Oct-20 02:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'll wait for Jackson to reply


[11-Oct-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
Maddy the senior is friends with cbs as I know she‚Äôs been in the cb server


[11-Oct-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
So


[11-Oct-20 02:10 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah it‚Äôs concerning


[11-Oct-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
If MRs wanted a survey thing they could‚Äôve asked the HRs to create one and make an announcement on it so we could see the answers and run it


[11-Oct-20 02:11 PM] stacey#1000
MRs want to be included in decisions, well they have to understand there is a lot of decisions they cannot make and the HRs do it behind the scenes


[11-Oct-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Exactly


[11-Oct-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Us, as HRs, are employed to make the decisions


[11-Oct-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Not the MRs


[11-Oct-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Anyways


[11-Oct-20 02:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I have a feeling its about the former MR chat idk though, it's just coincidental that they're doing this now after yesterdays announcement


[11-Oct-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
And if they wanted to do a survey, they could've at least briefed HRs prior


[11-Oct-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
The MRs dont have the experience to be making these decisions


[11-Oct-20 02:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Tattoblue Ikr


[11-Oct-20 02:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
and the former MR chat wasnt really our decision either, baby told us not to make one (not like we were going to but)


[11-Oct-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
This just goes to say my worries for Maddy.


[11-Oct-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
I think she is close to a termination herself. She‚Äôs been suspended way too many times, been warned a lot, so her next strike....well possible termination.


[11-Oct-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
And shes closer to CBs


[11-Oct-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
How many suspensions would be a demotion


[11-Oct-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
The standard was 3 but like


[11-Oct-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
we don't really enforce that in MRs


[11-Oct-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's case-by-case


[11-Oct-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
Cause


[11-Oct-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's not often we have a situation like that


[11-Oct-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
Just keep an eye on Maddy is all.

Alright, give me 10-15 minutes and I'll get the announcement rolled out

Trolling forms will just get marked as declined instantly

The form is on a 2-week trial so depending on how it works, we'll keep it or revert


[11-Oct-20 03:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
All main flaws should be patched though

When MRs start recommending Trey for an MR position, idk how I feel about this

@impact How do ya do that


[11-Oct-20 03:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey And uh, honestly, I wouldn't mind Trey as an MR again cause he's been like mega active and stuff lately, but I do think time and heavy consideration is needed. Baby and Bear would also need to approve.


[11-Oct-20 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn‚Äôt mind either as he hasn‚Äôt done anything bad since his termination and he has been fairly respectful and active. But that would be up to baby and bear


[11-Oct-20 03:15 PM] impact#0297
@xM_inn you could make it to only one account

Don't limit to one response, but make it that you need an email account to do the survey.

:bloxton3: **| INTRODUCING OUR NEW APPEAL SYSTEM**

Greetings Bloxton Hotels,

The High-Rank Team has recently been working on a more efficient way to process our appeals. Our current system is very outdated and also very untidy, therefore we've decided to implement a brand new system to make our jobs easier and to improve communication with those who submit appeals. All ban and blacklist appeals will now be processed through a Google Form which will be actively managed and maintained by our High-Rank Team. Anyone who submits an appeal will be contacted within 1 week regarding the outcome of their appeal. If you know someone who is currently blacklisted or banned from any of our platforms and you know they want to appeal, be sure to inform them of this form so that they can do so! @everyone

üîó **| https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcDF4ZIC5dipytxTgDsHW_ia2H_92yI6O9xgm0SJMK2tXI6A**

This new method of processing appeals will be on a basic 2-week trial to see whether it works well or doesn't work well, depending on the decision it will then remain in place or we'll revert back to our old system. If you have any questions or concerns in regards to our new method of processing appeals, please don't hesitate in contacting myself or another member of the High-Rank Team.

Best regards,

xM_inn
Board of Directors
Bloxton Hotels

[11-Oct-20 03:42 PM] impact#0297
@xM_inn first 3 requests are CB's


[11-Oct-20 03:42 PM] impact#0297
is there anyway you can have it so they are blocked??


[11-Oct-20 03:42 PM] Fraux#7971
@xM_inn hmm lemme think .. i don‚Äôt have a roblox email


[11-Oct-20 03:43 PM] Fraux#7971
lemme figure it out


[11-Oct-20 03:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
@impact They'll get tired eventually, let's see how it pans out within the next few hours. Idk if that's a thing on Google Forms, I'll do some research

someone is impersonting vedom


[11-Oct-20 03:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
We all know who that is


[11-Oct-20 03:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
Anyways we seem to have a few genuine appeals sliding through


[11-Oct-20 03:46 PM] xM_inn#2821
If y'all have any concerns, lmk


[11-Oct-20 03:47 PM] impact#0297
@xM_inn Let it record the emails. It'll make it easier.


[11-Oct-20 03:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright


[11-Oct-20 03:47 PM] Fraux#7971
that‚Äôs gonna be an issue with this, how do we know if someone isn‚Äôt impersonating someone. like for example if someone like a former MR appeals, but it isn‚Äôt them


[11-Oct-20 03:47 PM] xM_inn#2821

[11-Oct-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I added my old email can you add this one instead staceyRBLX@gmail.com


[11-Oct-20 03:48 PM] impact#0297
Can't you make it automatic via Google?


[11-Oct-20 03:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Fraux It's all on trial, if it becomes a major issue then we can just revert it.


[11-Oct-20 03:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
@impact No that's the only way it allows it.


[11-Oct-20 03:48 PM] impact#0297
Take it off then.


[11-Oct-20 03:48 PM] xM_inn#2821

[11-Oct-20 03:51 PM] Fraux#7971
@xM_inn yeah definitely!! im totally excited to see how it works out


[11-Oct-20 03:51 PM] Fraux#7971
also i was reading up what i missed


[11-Oct-20 03:51 PM] Fraux#7971
y r they doing surveys about mr power and stuff...


[11-Oct-20 03:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
That's what imma try find out


[11-Oct-20 03:52 PM] Fraux#7971
And then @stacey i wouldn‚Äôt be against trey as an mr bc he‚Äôs pretty active and i personally havent seen him act out whatsoever since his termination but like you said that‚Äôs a baby and bear thing


[11-Oct-20 03:52 PM] Fraux#7971
@xM_inn do they want us to let heads host session or something like-


[11-Oct-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
Ill bring it up next meeting


[11-Oct-20 03:53 PM] impact#0297
I'm extremely against Trey becoming MR.


[11-Oct-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
Reasons?


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
We should take a vote on it


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
on meeting


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
just to see every HRs opinion on it


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] impact#0297
If he has any access to our lounges or information that is non-public, I think he would be a greater risk considering his relationships with people who want to harm BH.


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] Fraux#7971
@xM_inn send me a friend request


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
I really don't think Trey is a person who would leak


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
Given he could've leaked a lot of HR+ information when he was terminated and he did not


[11-Oct-20 03:54 PM] impact#0297
He isn't, but the people around him are.


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] Fraux#7971
i don‚Äôt think he would spread any mr+ information


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
He is not a person who would tell them and i don't think we should hold that against him just because he still talks to some former HRs


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] impact#0297
Plus, he just became a bartender. We hold people down there for a LONG time before they come up to head.


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
I still talk to former HRs


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
He became a bartender 2-3 months ago


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
Right after he was terminated


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] impact#0297
So do I.. I had a conversation with him about Former MR Chatroom yesterday after the announcement.


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
well


[11-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
like August


[11-Oct-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
Im just saying we shouldnt assume he would leak when hes shown good behaviour


[11-Oct-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
Im not saying he should become an MR right now but it could maybe be considered in a month if he remains active

@bonnie591 there is no abuse of admin.. in order to move people.. you need to have the move abilities in BOTH channels on discord.. so people with my role could pull someone who wanted to play Among Us could go into VC3 and get moved..


[11-Oct-20 05:09 PM] impact#0297
and then they would get moved to my office


[11-Oct-20 05:09 PM] impact#0297
I was supervising it as well.. I was planning on taking it away after Flyro finished the game


[11-Oct-20 05:10 PM] impact#0297
I get your concern, but it's only for BOTH channels


[11-Oct-20 05:10 PM] impact#0297
So it eliminates your concern (and mine frankly) of admin abuse


[11-Oct-20 05:10 PM] impact#0297
Plus, Trey was playing games with Flyro, and trust me, I would know very quickly from Trey if there was any admin abuse...


[11-Oct-20 05:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Still, they shouldn't have the power to move people out of vc3. The mrs was highly against it in staff lounge even though it was only vc3. Ur ok to do it again but  maybe consider a temporary vc for it instead of using one of the main voice channels


[11-Oct-20 05:12 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn dont appeal treeseeker he is perm banned no appeals


[11-Oct-20 05:12 PM] ethan;#0003

[11-Oct-20 05:12 PM] ethan;#0003
he said he dmed u


[11-Oct-20 05:12 PM] impact#0297
Sounds good. I didn't want to create the channel to cause a disturbance, but I can do that next time.


[11-Oct-20 05:15 PM] ethan;#0003
is there another way to view the responses to the fourm?


[11-Oct-20 05:15 PM] ethan;#0003
its hard to read it on that sheet


[11-Oct-20 05:15 PM] ethan;#0003
idk where responses end and start

Ayesha and annie resigned i believe..thats the topic in SL right now


[11-Oct-20 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank I let ayesha resign to lr instead of just going down to hotel guest. I believe that's fine as resigning to an LR position doesn't affect anything


[11-Oct-20 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
Ya that‚Äôs fine


[11-Oct-20 06:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@bonnie591 i think its a good idea


[11-Oct-20 06:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i dont think anyone will utizile it


[11-Oct-20 06:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
utilize


[11-Oct-20 06:07 PM] courtney#5125
i think it‚Äôs fine to resign to an lr rank, but it‚Äôs a huge no go for resigning to head or management for me


[11-Oct-20 06:07 PM] Polk#1596
Gotta go with a no on that one, it sounds alright but I don't see a purpose to it


[11-Oct-20 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
It would get confusing


[11-Oct-20 06:08 PM] courtney#5125
thats just... it‚Äôs just rlly out of system and its way too complex. if they resign, then they‚Äôre off the mr team until they earn it again


[11-Oct-20 06:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh yeah that is true


[11-Oct-20 06:08 PM] courtney#5125
plus it could potentially make ranks really uneven at some point


[11-Oct-20 06:08 PM] Tattoblue#5828
that kinda ruins the point of resigning


[11-Oct-20 06:09 PM] courtney#5125
right, i don‚Äôt like the idea of it


[11-Oct-20 06:12 PM] courtney#5125
was flyro given admin permissions to be able to move ppl from voice chats to different voice chats...?

Let's do a promo week


[11-Oct-20 06:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya know I'd consider promoting trey if I were u guys


[11-Oct-20 06:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
He's shown true loyalty


[11-Oct-20 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I honestly don‚Äôt mind trey coming as an MR either. he really has tbh


[11-Oct-20 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he‚Äôs never really been an issue


[11-Oct-20 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder thoughts on allowing trey to become an MR again? MRs are recommending him and he has shown no issues since he was terminated, he remained respectful and is active. Your choice though.


[11-Oct-20 06:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
Dibs on promoting if baby and bear approve.


[11-Oct-20 06:48 PM] stacey#1000

[11-Oct-20 08:40 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank Did anyone remove Dawson_z former MR role? Just need to confirm if he left the server or not so if he requested his former MR role again to deny it.


[11-Oct-20 08:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ye


[11-Oct-20 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
what did he do?


[11-Oct-20 08:40 PM] stacey#1000
tbh he should just be banned from the server


[11-Oct-20 08:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
Anna did due to his behaviour and breaking rules in vc


[11-Oct-20 08:41 PM] stacey#1000
He played ear rape and caused drama in general


[11-Oct-20 08:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u have reason to ban then go ahead


[11-Oct-20 08:41 PM] stacey#1000

Hi Bonnie


[12-Oct-20 01:52 AM] stacey#1000
I hosted a Envtops gamenight for first time


[12-Oct-20 01:52 AM] stacey#1000

[12-Oct-20 10:47 AM] katie#0200
@courtney do you know when her role was removed?


[12-Oct-20 10:52 AM] stacey#1000
@katie no she‚Äôs in the cb server and trash talks in it


[12-Oct-20 10:53 AM] courtney#5125
she‚Äôs trash talked very recently?


[12-Oct-20 10:53 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[12-Oct-20 10:53 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs involved with cbs


[12-Oct-20 10:53 AM] katie#0200
do you have proof


[12-Oct-20 10:53 AM] stacey#1000
I saw her in the server when I was in it and no I can‚Äôt get proof I was kicked from the server


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] stacey#1000
But since she‚Äôs involved with cbs now I vote no


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] courtney#5125
also Katie she was banned a few months ago and appealed abt a month ago, so I‚Äôm assuming it was removed after her ban


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] courtney#5125
wait but Stacey i thought u were in the server several months ago


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] stacey#1000
It was 2 months ago


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] emily#4444
kenzi can still be pretty rude sometimes, i don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs changed


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] stacey#1000
And either way what I witnessed from her I won‚Äôt vote yes


[12-Oct-20 10:54 AM] courtney#5125
good point


[12-Oct-20 10:55 AM] stacey#1000
Lauren has turned very rude as well


[12-Oct-20 10:55 AM] courtney#5125
yeah that‚Äôs true Emily, she‚Äôs still kind of rude at times when talking in general discussion


[12-Oct-20 10:55 AM] stacey#1000
Not to your face but behind your back she‚Äôs rude af


[12-Oct-20 10:55 AM] katie#0200

@High Rank Please make sure you log accepted and declined appeals on the HR board as explained in the information document. All you need to do is add a card with the format Username | Type of Appeal and then comment the row that their appeal is located within the sheet. Trolling applications don't need to be logged under declined, but otherwise declined appeals should still be logged!


[12-Oct-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Also ensure you're filling out the final bit, whether it's a troll application or not. There shouldn't be any blank spaces under section 5. https://gyazo.com/b4b79cd0ddd180bda440d4388d99ead0

He was acting really shady at first and kept trying to refer me to marissa (alistelle) instead


[12-Oct-20 03:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
Doesn't seem like the biggest of deals, however I'd note those 4 individuals involved for future reference


[12-Oct-20 04:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"certain issued have remained unaddressed for far too long"


[12-Oct-20 04:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What issue tho?


[12-Oct-20 04:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
That's like a teacher marking your paper as a F, but not marking the questions that you messed up on.


[12-Oct-20 04:38 PM] ethan;#0003

[12-Oct-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
So idk if I can promote her


[12-Oct-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
If her activity has dropped maybe second guess promoting her rn


[12-Oct-20 08:09 PM] courtney#5125
well i wouldnt second guess it


[12-Oct-20 08:10 PM] courtney#5125
she just went on a notice bc of the hurricane in her area


[12-Oct-20 08:10 PM] courtney#5125
if fraux is still in texas like he said, im assuming thats where she is too


[12-Oct-20 08:10 PM] courtney#5125
i still believe she deserves management, not her fault the weather doesnt allow her to come online for the time being


[12-Oct-20 08:13 PM] Fraux#7971
@stacey we have been dealing with the hurricane


[12-Oct-20 08:14 PM] stacey#1000

[13-Oct-20 10:25 AM] bonnie591#0591
what if we had a board where


[13-Oct-20 10:25 AM] stacey#1000
huh


[13-Oct-20 10:25 AM] bonnie591#0591

[13-Oct-20 10:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
suspension


[13-Oct-20 10:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
any other information we might need to record


[13-Oct-20 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
That a good idea cause I always forget how many times people have been suspended


[13-Oct-20 10:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
its not needed but it would be cool


[13-Oct-20 10:26 AM] bonnie591#0591

[13-Oct-20 10:27 AM] stacey#1000

MR TRACKING DATABASE!


[13-Oct-20 10:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
That'd be so cool as well


[13-Oct-20 10:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
It could be like the old attendance board, except it won't be used for session attendance, unless y'all want to use it for that but it might make sessions a bit more complicated!


[13-Oct-20 11:58 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

Kylieenoir for Management or with her close friends that resigned maybe wait?


[13-Oct-20 01:41 PM] courtney#5125
i would vote her for management, im just unsure of her dedication to the group after she lost so many friends. she was thinking about resigning only a few days ago, sooo


[13-Oct-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
what would L_3ee for management? I know he had issues with maturity and such in the past, but has also helped with a lot of stuff at the hotel. Has he improved recently or not ready for management yet?


[13-Oct-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
and if so how long would you say?


[13-Oct-20 02:45 PM] courtney#5125
i personally dont think hes improved, just from my standpoint. he still seems pretty immature in-game and he can be rude on discord. maybe a few weeks or so if he shows improvements, imo


[13-Oct-20 02:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i see him a lot, but he's definetly still immature and comes off as rude sometimes.


[13-Oct-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
alright so give him more time


[13-Oct-20 02:46 PM] courtney#5125
omggg cat's winning the senior vote


[13-Oct-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
we gotta work at getting more heads rn


[13-Oct-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
we very low on heads since a lot resigned


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] courtney#5125
yeah for once i dont always have 8 mrs at interviews all the time


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
lets look into getting new heads


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
im gonna add one


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
I see her all the time


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
lia_trey


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] courtney#5125
i see her a lot!!


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] courtney#5125
u have my vote


[13-Oct-20 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
would make a good rank 10


[13-Oct-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
let me add


[13-Oct-20 02:48 PM] courtney#5125
im going to add linnvy too. shes been a head for 2 months


[13-Oct-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
pls vote!


[13-Oct-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
https://trello.com/c/Legk7Z05/37034-liatrey-receptionst


[13-Oct-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
oo yes ill vote her


[13-Oct-20 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
since we could use more management too


[13-Oct-20 02:49 PM] courtney#5125
yay!


[13-Oct-20 02:50 PM] courtney#5125
@KjRBLX tbh u could add kylie if u were thinking abt adding her. shes been very consistent for nearly three months now, and if she hasnt resigned already because of her friends, i doubt she will


[13-Oct-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
ya id vote her


[13-Oct-20 02:50 PM] courtney#5125
same yes


[13-Oct-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
how about Jspace1?


[13-Oct-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
another receptionist I see a bit


[13-Oct-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
or xAuroraii rank 5


[13-Oct-20 02:52 PM] stacey#1000
im gonna add xAuroraii


[13-Oct-20 02:52 PM] courtney#5125
yes id vote for xAuroraii. a bunch of managers were talking abt her being good like a month or so ago. but she had only been in her position for 2 weeks then, but i think shes good now!


[13-Oct-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
alrighty I added!


[13-Oct-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
Ill stick with those 2 for now


[13-Oct-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
get a new rank 10 and rank 9


[13-Oct-20 02:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah I'd recommend against L_3ee for now, not the most mature, more time needed.


[13-Oct-20 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
go vote people!!


[13-Oct-20 02:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes ma'am


[13-Oct-20 02:56 PM] stacey#1000
2 more votes needed :DD


[13-Oct-20 03:00 PM] anna#0004

[13-Oct-20 03:03 PM] courtney#5125

ooohh nvm


[13-Oct-20 03:28 PM] stacey#1000
I banned him, he played ear rape in vc and was warned about 5+ times by a manager and senior, then continued. He was also quite rude in general discussion and caused drama. After being given multiple chances and warned his former role was taken and then I banned him @courtney


[13-Oct-20 03:29 PM] courtney#5125
yeah I saw a brief description of that in the ban reason. thank you for more of an explanation!!


[13-Oct-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah a manager reported it to me and I just decided banning him was best from what I heard about his behaviour. Disappointing for a former MR.


[13-Oct-20 03:30 PM] courtney#5125
right no kidding.. D:


[13-Oct-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
1 more vote needed for promotion opinions!!!


[13-Oct-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
@stacey do u remember anything exactly that he said that was rude?


[13-Oct-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
Not exactly no


[13-Oct-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
In a public voice chat he played loud music purposely, was server muted, given a couple more chances then played loud music again


[13-Oct-20 03:51 PM] stacey#1000
Then caused drama


[13-Oct-20 04:17 PM] stacey#1000

@courtney itd be hard to give proof of him because everything was in the Snapchat group (not everything but a lot) and it‚Äôd expose that addie exposed their group chat so they‚Äôd probably put 2 and 2 together and figure out it was addie


[13-Oct-20 05:32 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Trying to play it off as if he‚Äôs innocent

Yesterday, Skypanda44 was once again was suspicious.


[15-Oct-20 03:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And yesterday, I decided to join a server at the hotel where other mrs were and skypanda was in


[15-Oct-20 03:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
There were mrs standing behind skypanda...I stood close..and now

I think of skypanda suggesting herself on alts.


[15-Oct-20 03:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Now I talked to one of her believed alts, the user even suggested Skypanda...I asked the user if they knew who Skypanda was, they said no but a little few seconds later they corrected themselves


[15-Oct-20 03:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I haven't spoke with Skypanda44..


[15-Oct-20 03:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Now, why would she be suspicious of being blacklisted, if "she didn't do anything"?


[15-Oct-20 03:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
MRs even told me that they talked to her and the people that suggested her at the same time, and after one finishes speaking the other one starts talking.

[15-Oct-20 03:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ebay?


[15-Oct-20 03:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean, you probably could of got the Windows Installer, downloaded a copy of windows onto like a flash drive, plug it into the broken, I think you would boot off the flash drive,  and it would take u to an installer I believe


[15-Oct-20 03:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If it was really just windows that was broken.


[15-Oct-20 03:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
üò≥ üò≥ thats confusing, im terrible with PCs


[15-Oct-20 03:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
is it a gaming computer üòè  @xM_inn


[15-Oct-20 03:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
somewhere around windows media creation tool


[15-Oct-20 03:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Tattoblue yes!


[15-Oct-20 03:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If your windows was activated, when you use the flash drive, I believe it should auto reactive, because Microsoft servers I believe log your hardware so if you try to use a key and the hardware doesn't match up, it won't let u use it


[15-Oct-20 03:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but u can also sometimes transfer a windows activation key to another computer


[15-Oct-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
i put free hat promo codes in event announcements


[15-Oct-20 03:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
what wud we do without u @ethan;


[15-Oct-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
hey hey hey i have


[15-Oct-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
a


[15-Oct-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
request


[15-Oct-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
can we make another announcement to managers and seniors talking about this again https://discord.com/channels/381478223567126531/459647111902920705/734834239408832522


[15-Oct-20 03:50 PM] courtney#5125
bc i had 2 managers dm me saying they 1) didnt know if it was still a thing 2) said that a lot of seniors still make them choose mrs to train ranks that arent their own and 3) said that many managers arent aware of it


[15-Oct-20 03:51 PM] courtney#5125
just like a clarification announcement so everyone is on the same page again


[15-Oct-20 03:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes


[15-Oct-20 03:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
whoops


[15-Oct-20 03:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
yes aannouncement


[15-Oct-20 03:57 PM] anna#0004
i mean ya they can get a manager to train sec or have an lr train sec while a manager or the host just demonstrates cuffs but heads should have training guides for all ranks anyway so making them train sec rather than their own shouldnt be too much of an issue - just because lrs cant use the cuffs

but ya an announcement would be good to clear it up!!


[15-Oct-20 04:04 PM] courtney#5125
woo perfect!


[15-Oct-20 04:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
@courtney already done


[15-Oct-20 04:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
U probably know but just saying


[15-Oct-20 04:26 PM] courtney#5125
yes i saw!!


[15-Oct-20 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591

[15-Oct-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Oct-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
so yeah just keep an eye on her more


[15-Oct-20 05:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
:Thumbsup:ill try to keep an eye out, and ill look at the card later inbetween the end of my trainings and start of interviews


[15-Oct-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
tyty!


[15-Oct-20 05:46 PM] ethan;#0003

[15-Oct-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Oct-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
sessions


[15-Oct-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Oct-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Oct-20 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
im just saying shes improving activity wise is all


[15-Oct-20 05:47 PM] ethan;#0003

[15-Oct-20 05:47 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Oct-20 05:47 PM] stacey#1000

[16-Oct-20 02:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey has the leaking continued? I'm planning on promoting dooner in the next few weeks and if it starts again with management content then he's our suspect


[16-Oct-20 10:14 AM] courtney#5125
can vibeskies have the former mr roleeee? its been over a month since his termination


[16-Oct-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 not that I know of


[16-Oct-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
@courtney yes

omggg cat won the senior vote yayfayay


[16-Oct-20 03:20 PM] ethan;#0003
@anna do you remember there was two people optimistic and 1 other person who where on hold then not on hold for manager


[16-Oct-20 03:20 PM] ethan;#0003
doubt it optimisitic


[16-Oct-20 03:21 PM] ethan;#0003
but i dont remember the other person


[16-Oct-20 03:21 PM] ethan;#0003
because manager board hasn't been leaked in a LONG LONG time


[16-Oct-20 03:21 PM] anna#0004
wasnt that dooner who was on hold


[16-Oct-20 03:21 PM] ethan;#0003
it was 3 people


[16-Oct-20 03:21 PM] ethan;#0003
buried


[16-Oct-20 03:21 PM] ethan;#0003
buried dooner optimistic where on hold


[16-Oct-20 03:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they leak anything in management lounge and we can prove its bst then


[16-Oct-20 03:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
buried probably


[16-Oct-20 03:22 PM] anna#0004
oh right, well so far they havent leaked anything from the board as far as i know, but they seem to be planning on it soooo we'll just keep an eye out


[16-Oct-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
well who says x


[16-Oct-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
after sentences


[16-Oct-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
un ironicly


[16-Oct-20 03:24 PM] ethan;#0003
that will really narrow it down

wasn‚Äôt hxshsmh also only a head

uh


[16-Oct-20 03:28 PM] anna#0004
yeha


[16-Oct-20 03:28 PM] anna#0004
yeah


[16-Oct-20 03:29 PM] courtney#5125
plus it‚Äôs hard to blame random ppl simply for saying ‚Äúx‚Äù. so much of the British population and even non British ppl say ur ironically and unironically. it‚Äôs just a thing


[16-Oct-20 03:29 PM] courtney#5125
*say it


[16-Oct-20 03:29 PM] courtney#5125
it barely narrows it down, so many ppl do it. just the new trend


[16-Oct-20 03:32 PM] anna#0004
if im being completely honest, it is mainly girls who use it though, i barely see boys using x at the end. if we were going to name former managers who use it then i know amira does sometimes but we're gonna need a lot more proof obviously to determine who it is


[16-Oct-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; the manager board was leaked about a month ago


[16-Oct-20 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003
O


[16-Oct-20 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003
it was?


[16-Oct-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
Remember when like


[16-Oct-20 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003
oh yeah i remember


[16-Oct-20 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
Someone sent a photo of the board to a cb


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
we suspended uni


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
but never figured out who


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
i mean


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
SUSPECETED


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
not suspended


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
We thought it was chief as well


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
that was more then 1 month


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] ethan;#0003
like right after cheif was promoted


[16-Oct-20 03:37 PM] courtney#5125
but cheif also isnt bst


[16-Oct-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah we never figured out who it was


[16-Oct-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney everyone knows there is a management board so unless stuff is leaked from management lounge there might not be a management leaker


[16-Oct-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
I think


[16-Oct-20 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
@anna


[16-Oct-20 03:38 PM] courtney#5125
well


[16-Oct-20 03:38 PM] courtney#5125
not everyone really knows of the board


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
Well it‚Äôs knowledge a lot of people know


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] courtney#5125
at least i dont think they do


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
So I think if they just say there is a a management board at the hotel but no content from management lounge


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
Or bans on the board


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
Then idk


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
But it could be buried bear if it is


[16-Oct-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
He was promoted now right?


[16-Oct-20 03:40 PM] courtney#5125
he was promoted just the other day


[16-Oct-20 03:40 PM] courtney#5125
and hes bst


[16-Oct-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
So it could be him


[16-Oct-20 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
If stuff is all of a sudden getting leaked but we should try to get evidence of stuff from management lounge getting leaked


[16-Oct-20 03:41 PM] anna#0004
yeah a lot of people do know, but they might start leaking stuff, well thats what it seems like, so just incase we do get reports of leaking anytime soon then we'd have seen it coming and also we just got new management in


[16-Oct-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
We know who to suspend if so


[16-Oct-20 03:42 PM] anna#0004

I mean we could do that but we said we didnt want an appeals trello so idkk


[17-Oct-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
there is probs a way to put it on discord


[17-Oct-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
because its difficult to read on the fourm


[17-Oct-20 06:22 PM] ethan;#0003
very small


[17-Oct-20 06:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[17-Oct-20 06:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
it'd be neat to have it in discord :Think:


[17-Oct-20 06:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
easier to read em


[17-Oct-20 06:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we'll probably get through more too


[17-Oct-20 06:28 PM] ethan;#0003
it might be hard becus cards would get lost


[17-Oct-20 06:28 PM] ethan;#0003
since you can only scroll up and down


[17-Oct-20 06:28 PM] ethan;#0003
not left and right


[17-Oct-20 06:29 PM] ethan;#0003
and you might miss one and not see it


[17-Oct-20 06:29 PM] Tattoblue#5828
if we have it in discord we can add reactions to see


[17-Oct-20 06:29 PM] Tattoblue#5828
if it got appealed or denied


[17-Oct-20 06:29 PM] Tattoblue#5828
and if one has no reaction youll know

rope cross is easy! if u find it difficult, make ur mouse sensitivity really low and go in first person and look at the line


[19-Oct-20 02:58 PM] Polk#1596
then u just walk forward and keep ur mouse on it

yes i say make an announcement. that should soooo not be happening, it happened so much with vedom bc mrs would trash talk him to the point where it became sad to even read. people are fired or terminated for trash talking in other servers, like cb servers, and mrs are aware that people are fired for it bc of the termination announcements. they should be 100% that it‚Äôs not okay to say such awful things about a person, regardless of if that person will ever see it or not

[19-Oct-20 05:06 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, and he dmed me abt it a few weeks ago telling me that he was really upset about it after seeing what terrible things were said about him before he was promoted


[19-Oct-20 05:12 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey I think it‚Äôs worth making an announcement. They never know who might get promoted and they‚Äôre supposed to be role models so it no look good on them

Comments Made in Staff Lounge

Greetings, MRs. 

It has been brought to the HR teams attention that many conversations in staff lounge involve trash talking LRs. This is unacceptable behaviour as you all should be respecting your members of staff, even if it is in a private channel the LRs cannot see. How do you think they would feel if they came to see the comments you have made regarding them?  

Staff lounge is meant for you all to be able to have conversations with each other, get to know each other, while remaining respectful to everyone. Remember, staff lounge is a privilege that can easily be taken away if needed.  It has been done before.   So please, be mindful of the comments you make against others even if they cannot see it. 

Going forward, if we see anyone trash talking LRs, such as showing PMs with them and laughing at them, etc there will be consequences. Staff lounge is not a place for you to disrespect, trash talk and make fun of other staff members. If we see this happening after this announcement is made, expect to receive a warning, suspension, or termination. Even if the person is disrespectful to you, it doesn‚Äôt give you the right to treat them the same way back. Remember to treat everyone how you wish to be treated.  We do not tolerate bullying under any circumstances. 

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask any member of the HR team. 

Sincerely,
staceyvx 
General Manager 
Bloxton Hotels

okay thanks for letting me know!!


[21-Oct-20 04:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
On the appeal spreadsheet, I setup a formula for the columns E,J,O,U, so when you highlight over the row to turn it green or red you don't have to go back and change the blank colums back to black


[21-Oct-20 04:32 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, I can't deliver the decline letter by looking them up in the quick message so do I even bother? Or I have to send a FR?

Should I just put "not long ago behavior"


[21-Oct-20 10:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Cuz I don't think I can put "because Stacey saw you in the CB Discord Server involved with CBs."

[22-Oct-20 07:07 PM] ethan;#0003
when you make an announcement its just people who think they are funny  they bring up parts of it that make people mad and then they purpously try to argue with people


[22-Oct-20 07:24 PM] Fraux#7971
I didn‚Äôt rly mean a big public announcement like that‚Äôs way too unnecessary, just a little heads up to seniors to keep an extra eye out while it occurs

If anyone noticed something on the spreadsheet like x column cells are Yellow or Purple, I added a automatic format for if it detects certain words in that cell, then it will color it. 
**Purple detects "not log" for the words "Not logged"** 
**Yellow detects "Letter" for words "Letter Awaiting"** I selected those because thats the way I would type it out when I'm making a decision.
Example: "Accepted, Letter Awaiting, Not Logged"
If you take out "Not logged" then the cell will turn Yellow because "Letter Awaiting" is still in the phrase. Vice Verse if you remove "Letter Awaiting" and keep "Not logged"
**The only reason I did that was because I'm just going through and reading, and doing the extra steps later.** and the color formatting will help me know which ones to go back too


[23-Oct-20 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX there see she admitted she was in the cb server in august and I was in it during July and saw her in it.

Questioning because of the username on row 69 of the appeal sheet.

Apparently one of Vedom's friends Lior was framed as a CB when a CB trolled and claimed his main was his account?


[24-Oct-20 01:57 AM] babymariobebe#7563
This is all the proof that was sent.. What am I supposed to do with this


[24-Oct-20 01:58 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[24-Oct-20 05:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
I handled it already


[24-Oct-20 05:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Basically he just wanted to make sure he could play bloxton without getting banned


[24-Oct-20 05:46 AM] babymariobebe#7563
which I reassured him is the case, yes. And that he shouldnt be banned unless he is trolling or stuff


[24-Oct-20 05:47 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Basically just nothing


[24-Oct-20 05:47 AM] babymariobebe#7563

[24-Oct-20 10:48 AM] bonnie591#0591

Ticket-0023, a user says someone is in their dm's talking bad about a HR and that their a staff.


[24-Oct-20 11:31 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Honestly, it might be that Mark guy.


[24-Oct-20 11:31 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Should I get them to send the proof or just tell them to just block them if they feel uncomfortable talking to them and just close the ticket?


[24-Oct-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000
Tell them to send proof then to block the user


[24-Oct-20 11:48 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Ticket-0023 proof sent.

@High Rank @Hilton Founder 

Hi folks. I hope you are all having a wonderful Sunday. I would've liked to hosted a meeting this weekend, but I have been busy with some other real life issues. There is a couple things that I want to bring to all of your attentions, and preferably, a comment or two:

1) Cam & Kkx have both reached out to me, asking for the opportunity to possibly return back to Hilton Hotel's in a high rank capacity. I know our policy on this is pretty strict, but I wanted to hear what you all have to say.


[25-Oct-20 03:41 PM] ethan;#0003
cam üòç


[25-Oct-20 03:42 PM] courtney#5125
wait you mean let them back on the hr team..?


[25-Oct-20 03:42 PM] impact#0297
2) I just had some discussions with senior managers, they are tired of some high ranks closing their direct messages to friends only. If that's you -- please remove that.


[25-Oct-20 03:43 PM] ethan;#0003
other groups have things that former HRS can come back has mrs


[25-Oct-20 03:43 PM] courtney#5125
i mean itd be cool if they could come back as mrs but letting them come back as hrs seems like a bit muchhh :/


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] Polk#1596
when we gave kj back his HR rank people went wild, i dont think its the smartest idea


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] Polk#1596
i love both of them though, super cool people


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] ethan;#0003
cam resigned under very short notice


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] impact#0297
3) I've had some complaints regarding the way we announce terminated middle ranks -- some MR's are wondering why we announce their termination (especially since some didn't want an announce apparently) -- can we review our policy on this?


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] ethan;#0003
because he felt attacked


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] courtney#5125
if we're in need of shift managers, we have many capable seniors who would love the opportunity instead of former hrs whove been on the hr team for months in the past


[25-Oct-20 03:44 PM] Polk#1596
i would rather hire new senior managements like normal


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] Polk#1596
cyto you'll have to ask min about that


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] courtney#5125
and yes what polk saiddd, ppl would not be a fan of that. it was hardly a liked decision the first time


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] impact#0297
@babymariobebe @Beartikal 4) inappropriate audio on the boomboxes have been rising occurrences, can you please fix this? https://youtu.be/BR4upq3CMqs

[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I'd love to have them both back, but last time we brought people back it wasnt recieved well by the public. I am against bringing them back to the HR team though


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] Polk#1596
he somewhat made the policy


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] impact#0297
@Polk 5) some seniors are wondering on the status of the management board fixup ??


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
there is no way to fix that


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
innapropriate boomboxes


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] courtney#5125
id like to see some seniors join the hr team instead of having 2 hrs who have already had their chance for months


[25-Oct-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
it will always exist


[25-Oct-20 03:46 PM] Polk#1596
its not gonna be done yet


[25-Oct-20 03:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
> id like to see some seniors join the hr team instead of having 2 hrs who have already had their chance for months
@courtney agreed


[25-Oct-20 03:46 PM] Polk#1596
i know imag keeps pushing me about it


[25-Oct-20 03:46 PM] courtney#5125
yay tatto


[25-Oct-20 03:46 PM] impact#0297
@Polk lol imag is pushing me too.. but let's get that done


[25-Oct-20 03:48 PM] Polk#1596
it will be done whenever ive written all of the different pieces and put them together


[25-Oct-20 03:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
Is there any previously terminated MRs in particular that have raised their concerns? MRs are told about terminations as a form of being aware of who they should avoid communicating with and who to be aware of. MRs work closely with one another and deserve to know if another player has been removed from their position for malicious activity. A lot of other groups do this and I think it's fine the way it is right now. Our current MRs tend to appreciate being informed when one of their colleagues has been terminated as well. If you didn't get terminated in the first place then essentially it wouldn't be a problem. @impact


[25-Oct-20 03:48 PM] Polk#1596
but assuming she wants everything she recommended, it wont be an overnight change


[25-Oct-20 03:48 PM] impact#0297
@xM_inn That's what I thought too.. do you mind if I copy and paste that and send it back in response?


[25-Oct-20 03:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
as much as Kkx and cam were amazing Hrs, strongly disagree with bringing them back as hrs. Like candy said we have seniors who would love the opportunity to become HRs and it just wouldn‚Äôt be fair at all.


[25-Oct-20 03:49 PM] courtney#5125
yesyesyes


[25-Oct-20 03:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
@impact Yeah go ahead


[25-Oct-20 03:49 PM] katie#0200
agreed with bloo!


[25-Oct-20 03:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
And about Kkx and Cam, I absolutely love them 100% but I feel like public relations wise it isn't going to go down well


[25-Oct-20 03:50 PM] courtney#5125
yaaa ppl were upset enough the first time! no tyyy


[25-Oct-20 03:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
Seniors may also feel discouraged as well if we keep hiring former HRs


[25-Oct-20 03:50 PM] courtney#5125
agreeeed min


[25-Oct-20 03:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah and we don‚Äôt want that


[25-Oct-20 03:50 PM] Fraux#7971
personally, I‚Äôm not in favor of the HRs being able to come back as HRs. However, back when they used to be able to come back as management that is the max I would agree with


[25-Oct-20 03:50 PM] courtney#5125
the ones whove been working for a year+ and hopefully want to see themselves on the hr team someday will definitely be prettty upset abt that


[25-Oct-20 03:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
good hrs but no im not up to welcoming them back as a hr unless they work towards it


[25-Oct-20 03:51 PM] courtney#5125
itd be interesting to have them come back as mrs but when arty was ranked to management randomly, people werent really fans of that


[25-Oct-20 03:51 PM] ethan;#0003
I dont think pepople would mind if they came back as mrs


[25-Oct-20 03:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they earn it back sure


[25-Oct-20 03:51 PM] impact#0297
To be blunt, I don't think either of them can come back (public backlash) -- but I don't have any problems putting them on management and running special tasks from high ranks


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
I dont think they should come back as HRs


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] Fraux#7971
ONLY those that do not give any issues should be able to come back


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
I wouldn't mind giving them head or maybe management


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
But a lot has changed within management duties so we'll need to ensure they're fully trained


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
I feel like start them off as head would give them some experience as to what has changed


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] courtney#5125
free ranking them period isnt the best but ig itd be better to let them be mrs than hrs if we had no other option..


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
Mainly for Kkx


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
Im good with allowing them to come back as MRs, but as for HRs I think we should do a proper shift vote as there as senior managers that deserve the chance to be an HR


[25-Oct-20 03:52 PM] Polk#1596
why should we allow them back as MRs


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
no matter what rank we give them if its head or board of directors we'd get backlash. if they want mr then they can train and work towards it like others


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
free ranking people to HR just doesn't go well


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] ethan;#0003
We should have some type of thing where former hrs who have no conflict or drama after they resign can come back as a head or manager


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
so if we let them back, are we gonna have that for all former hrs to be able to come back as a head or manager


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] ethan;#0003
a lot of other groups have that


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] Polk#1596
im pretty sure baby or bear abolished the rule about coming back as management if youre a former HR


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
here is the thing though


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
we used to do that ethan but we dont anymore


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] courtney#5125
free ranking people to ANY rank doesnt go well either


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
i believe baby decided to stop allowing it


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] impact#0297
Cam hasn't caused drama, but he has been the victim of major accusations of dating someone from BH irl... but he states that's not true and I believe him


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] courtney#5125
if they want to become mrs, they need to work for it. just like slee did and just like trey seems to be doing :/


[25-Oct-20 03:53 PM] impact#0297
There is no concrete evidence -- other than they met IRL, nothing more nothing less.


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
id free rank them to lr, thats all


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
if we allow them back as MRs, whats the difference between letting trey back as an MR? the founders said  to give him more time as there is LRs that deserve it as well, and giving kkx and cam free ranks to MRs destroys that purpose.


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lol right


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
I havent seen kkx and cam do anything, they should have to earn it like trey does


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
well even then they might as well just go to training and interviews if we're going to rank them to lr


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
i agree stacey


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
at least slee truly worked hard for a month+ for his mr rank


[25-Oct-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
Like if we allowed kkx and cam back to MR, then Id like to see trey be given that chance too. i think they should have to earn it


[25-Oct-20 03:55 PM] courtney#5125
cant just free rank people when they regret leaving or miss the community, thats not how its worked in the past and i dont think we should change it now


[25-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
Agreed


[25-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
Kkx has not been an HR for over a year


[25-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
things have changed


[25-Oct-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
I think if they want to work here again, they need to earn it like everyone else


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
kkx resigned before i got hr


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] Polk#1596
well free ranking just isnt the way to go anyway


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
its been over a year and a half


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] Polk#1596
free ranking was only done that one time when baby and bear did the reform


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I understand they may miss it after a while but it was their decision to resign. I mean cam I understand his situation and he was in a tough position so I feel for him but the public will not like that.


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
free ranking shows we are biased and have favorites


[25-Oct-20 03:56 PM] impact#0297
hey so guys.. I was free ranked to strategic advisor.. quick question for you all: when do you want me gone?


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] Polk#1596
even if cam gets back, how will his situation of being attacked change


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] courtney#5125
uh well never


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] Polk#1596
the people are still there


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
you were ranking during the reforms and you have done a lot of good work so far, so thats your choice personally


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
I still have what the cbs said in their server about cam


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] courtney#5125
same as stacey


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] courtney#5125
!!


[25-Oct-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
if he came back he'd get hate again even more then before and just resign again because of it


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
he has to earn his rank again


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
yes like that aint gonna work out


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
strategic advisor isnt something you can progress up to, you're selected by the founders to be a strategic advisor so it isnt really a free rank


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] courtney#5125
im not even sure why exactly he wants to come back, since he was so overwhelmed by the amount of hate he got


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don‚Äôt see how much has changed in like what 2-3 months since he‚Äôs been gone.


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
you're still honor member in the group too


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] courtney#5125
being free ranked would only add to the hate he got :/


[25-Oct-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
I like how the founders said trey has to earn it more and work longer as there is LRs that deserve it more, it should be the same for kkx and cam


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
if they really want to come back, they should show it through hard work and dedication like everyone else


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] stacey#1000
If they work hard and show they are dedicated, then for sure they could get promoted


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
anyway back to my game. for the record im massively against this


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
nay from me


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok bye


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Polk#1596
ok


[25-Oct-20 03:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
bye sir


[25-Oct-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
bye


[25-Oct-20 04:01 PM] emily#4444

I dont think this user was suppose to be unbanned


[25-Oct-20 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
he was blacklisted


[25-Oct-20 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
so there shouldve been an HR vote on his appeal in HR announcements i think


[25-Oct-20 04:25 PM] stacey#1000
idk

Now, in the process of unbanning the user, I just noticed ethan put "no appeals" in the ban reason **In GAME**


[25-Oct-20 04:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
instead of on the card.


[25-Oct-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
o


[25-Oct-20 04:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
After i have sent out the letter and everything


[25-Oct-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
ya i think its too late now cause he shouldnt have gotten appeal


[25-Oct-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
hes been like


[25-Oct-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
blacklisted before I think


[25-Oct-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
and appealed before


[25-Oct-20 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
or banned before if not blacklisted


[25-Oct-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
rip he has to get unbanned now just monitor him is all


[25-Oct-20 04:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I will.


[25-Oct-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
i told him I contacted him for you


[25-Oct-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
so u can unban whenever


[25-Oct-20 04:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I got his message I just got home tho


[25-Oct-20 04:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Has he been annoying after he got appealed?

so like


[25-Oct-20 04:43 PM] stacey#1000
rip if people can only appeal once.....


[25-Oct-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
that was added when the form was first released to prevent spam


[25-Oct-20 04:47 PM] xM_inn#2821
since time has passed, i'll disable it now


[25-Oct-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
alrighty


[25-Oct-20 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003
Treeseeker has been told 100 times he can‚Äôt appeal


[25-Oct-20 05:43 PM] courtney#5125
I put a notice up in the inactivity notices column, so if a bod could approve that when available, that‚Äôd be great!!


[25-Oct-20 05:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
mhm! @courtney


[25-Oct-20 06:14 PM] courtney#5125
tysm!


[25-Oct-20 07:02 PM] impact#0297
@xM_inn @stacey honestly I kinda like that.. you can only appeal once.. after that you fucked up idk


[25-Oct-20 07:02 PM] courtney#5125
but it doesn‚Äôt really help for people who want to appeal a hotel ban and a discord ban!


[25-Oct-20 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
yea thats what it was for


[25-Oct-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
like he appealed for training or something


[25-Oct-20 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
then couldnt send in another appeal for discord


[25-Oct-20 07:04 PM] impact#0297
Why can't we make them select multiple ban appeals options?


[25-Oct-20 07:04 PM] impact#0297
Hotel + Discord?


[25-Oct-20 07:20 PM] courtney#5125
that would be helpful ya, and it‚Äôd still prevent spam forms !!

One of my "alarms" went off... I don't know the exact hour im suppose to get up..so I base it off an alarm. Once the first alarm go off, i start rushing to get ready.


[27-Oct-20 06:41 AM] KjRBLX#2053
So.. one of my "alarms"


[27-Oct-20 06:42 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I say "alarms" because one went off but I don't have one scheduled for 6:29 AM or before


[27-Oct-20 06:42 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And one went off before that time ^


[27-Oct-20 06:42 AM] KjRBLX#2053

I was probably crying in my sleep.


[27-Oct-20 07:03 AM] KjRBLX#2053

[27-Oct-20 11:24 AM] courtney#5125
yeah that girl just wants to hate on Libby for zero reason, I don‚Äôt get itttt but whatever !!


[27-Oct-20 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
I bet you that‚Äôs a cb


[27-Oct-20 11:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Ain doing nothing but wastin my free time at school


[27-Oct-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
They are usually the people that say people are promo thirsty and think they can decide who gets promoted or not


[27-Oct-20 11:26 AM] courtney#5125
I couldn‚Äôt really tell if it was a cb when I was talking to her, she just seemed jealous butttttt


[27-Oct-20 11:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I just blocked her


[27-Oct-20 11:26 AM] courtney#5125
yeah I did that a while ago, I was tired of her being bratty


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
So like she‚Äôs complaining about someone not being promoted?


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
Or what idk what she‚Äôs complaining about


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] courtney#5125
No she was complaining bc she didn‚Äôt want this one girl to be promoted


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
Was it someone that was promoted?


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
Which girl was she talking about


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] courtney#5125
No, just someone she doesn‚Äôt like who‚Äôs an LR!


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
Oh


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] courtney#5125
libbvyy


[27-Oct-20 11:27 AM] courtney#5125
is that LR that the girl has been harassing


[27-Oct-20 11:28 AM] courtney#5125
*the


[27-Oct-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
Oh I know her


[27-Oct-20 11:28 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Then she said to suspend candy because she was rude


[27-Oct-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve seen libby a few times


[27-Oct-20 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
So if we ever wanted to promote Libby she can‚Äôt stop us


[27-Oct-20 11:28 AM] courtney#5125
I was being ‚Äúrude‚Äù bc she was being really mean abt br1vnna being inactive and she kept telling me she wanted her to be fired


[27-Oct-20 11:29 AM] anna#0004
she keeps dming me too, its also weird because she *keeps* on talking about how this girl is so "active at the hotel, sticks up for hrs, always at training" and she says things like that and keeps saying **not** to promote her. but idk for some reason i keep thinking shes on an alt and is just saying not to promote the other girl for being active so that we *do* promote her and its her alt BUT THATS JUST ME it just seems like thats what shes trying to do by what shes saying


[27-Oct-20 11:29 AM] courtney#5125
yeah exactly Stacey but this girl just thinks her opinion changes the entire hr team‚Äôs view on someone


[27-Oct-20 11:29 AM] anna#0004
look what she says, doesnt that just seem like shes on an alt and trying to say those things to get herself promoted

[27-Oct-20 12:38 PM] impact#0297
she leaves when there is a bad announcement to stick it back to us.. then comes back asking for former mr (rinse and repeat)


[27-Oct-20 12:47 PM] stacey#1000
@anna never


[27-Oct-20 12:48 PM] stacey#1000
reasons being


[27-Oct-20 12:48 PM] stacey#1000
I blacklisted her, l meant to put never appeal if I didnt already


[27-Oct-20 12:48 PM] stacey#1000
she trash talked in a cb server, then tried to get promoted on an alt acc, begged an MR to leak stuff to her


[27-Oct-20 12:49 PM] anna#0004
Oh yeah you commented it, my bad! and alright thank youuu


[27-Oct-20 12:49 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Oct-20 12:49 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Oct-20 12:49 PM] anna#0004

[27-Oct-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
@courtney hm?


[27-Oct-20 12:52 PM] courtney#5125

[27-Oct-20 12:53 PM] anna#0004
oh wow, she keeps dming me saying her blacklist was false and she never did any of the stuff that got her blacklisted lol which obviously is a lie


[27-Oct-20 12:54 PM] stacey#1000
the evidence said otherwise LOL


[27-Oct-20 12:54 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Oct-20 12:54 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Oct-20 12:59 PM] anna#0004
yeah i think there were just too many situations with her tbh so appealing her wouldnt be the best idea


[27-Oct-20 01:00 PM] anna#0004
yeah haha she saw it coming


[27-Oct-20 01:00 PM] stacey#1000
tbh if she hadnt been dumb and went to a senior saying she wants to get promoted on an alt acc, tell them the alt acc, then ask them what was being said about her in staff lounge begging them to leak and not lie about everything, maybe she could've appealed some day.


[27-Oct-20 01:06 PM] anna#0004
LMAO thats so dumb, well she brought it upon herself sooooo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact I can‚Äôt give her the former role because she leaves the discord too much?


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] ethan;#0003
That‚Äôs not really a reason...


[27-Oct-20 01:19 PM] ethan;#0003
And she only did that once from what I can remember


[27-Oct-20 01:24 PM] impact#0297
@ethan; I'm attempt to get rid of silly formers like that who only attempt to cause drama -- then we'll re-consider the former mr chat


[27-Oct-20 01:24 PM] impact#0297
I'm playing the long game here -- really long game.


[27-Oct-20 01:24 PM] impact#0297
One-by-one, taking out bad former mr's and then allowing the chat for the good ones.


[27-Oct-20 01:25 PM] ethan;#0003
What am I supposed to tell her?


[27-Oct-20 01:25 PM] ethan;#0003
She can‚Äôt have it because she has left the discord 2 times?


[27-Oct-20 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
She isn‚Äôt one of the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù ones


[27-Oct-20 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
That‚Äôs cat


[27-Oct-20 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
And that‚Äôs why the toxic ones are banned


[27-Oct-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; i dont see why not


[27-Oct-20 01:39 PM] stacey#1000
if shes done nothing since then


[27-Oct-20 01:55 PM] impact#0297
Cinder is literally best friends with Cat.. lol


[27-Oct-20 01:55 PM] impact#0297
give to her if you want but it won't take too long


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
idk who cat is lol


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
I only think of Cat, the newest senior


[27-Oct-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I for some reason dont have access to view appeals


[27-Oct-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
im looking on google forms, nothing shared with me so


[27-Oct-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
I cannot do any appeals


[27-Oct-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
appeals on google forms is confusing


[27-Oct-20 03:12 PM] courtney#5125
yeah the appeals being on google forms is a tad hectic


[27-Oct-20 03:12 PM] courtney#5125
I mean sheets**


[27-Oct-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
o its on sheets


[27-Oct-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
let me see if I can see it


[27-Oct-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
o I can see it


[27-Oct-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
ya this is confusing


[27-Oct-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
where do i read individual ones


[27-Oct-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
if we had a trello board it would be better


[27-Oct-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
just my opinion


[27-Oct-20 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
like maybe they can still send appeals to managers like they did before, then the managers add a card to it to an appeal board and we review it there


[27-Oct-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney what you think of that idea


[27-Oct-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
this google sheets is on a trial basis


[27-Oct-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
so I still think a board would be better


[27-Oct-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
I find it really hard to read one appeal


[27-Oct-20 03:24 PM] courtney#5125
hmmmm I mean I think it being on a google form for them to submit is good, but if their answers could go to a Trello board that‚Äôd be great


[27-Oct-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
sorry im not doing appeals I find it very hard to read one and I dont work on google sheets well


[27-Oct-20 03:25 PM] courtney#5125
having another trello board isn‚Äôt necessarily ideal, i admit, but it‚Äôd be a lot more organized and clearer to read


[27-Oct-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
so my idea fully is like:


[27-Oct-20 03:25 PM] courtney#5125
having it on google sheets is very chaotic, like the words almost pile on top of each other and fill up different boxes and it‚Äôs just hectic to deal with


[27-Oct-20 03:27 PM] stacey#1000
People send an appeal to managers like they did before, then the manager adds the card to a board under the list on if its a discord ban appeal, hotel ban appeal, or a blacklist appeal, then they put their appeal in the description of the card. We can then read it easier and if it gets denied we can put it in accepted or denied and comment the reason if it gets denied so managers can contact them why it may be denied. On forms there is not really a way to tell people if it's denied either and when they can send another one.


[27-Oct-20 03:28 PM] stacey#1000
and it's also hard for them to send in another appeal if one is denied so.


[27-Oct-20 03:28 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn thoughts on making a board for appeals instead and having people send in appeals to managers like before, then managers add a card? the forms is good but I find it very hard to read one appeal


[27-Oct-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
it has been more then 2 weeks so the trial is done now


[27-Oct-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
so now we decide if we keep it or not

I see on 06/16/2020 Ramm and Cam has a slight conversation about his former mr role.


[27-Oct-20 03:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053

Nevermind, seems Cyto is handling something with that.

@stacey we already said in a previous meeting that we dont want a trello board because of the amount of boards we already have. The 2 week trial period will be reviewed soon but atm I think its working perfectly fine using the google sheets. If u read the information guide as well then you'll get used to reading appeals on sheets in no time. I also dont want to start letting managers take appeals as that got very messy.


[28-Oct-20 07:12 AM] ethan;#0003
ngl i think if we did a vote i think a majority wouldnt mind another trello board


[28-Oct-20 07:12 AM] ethan;#0003
becuase the current way of reading appeals is kinda difficult

id consider reinstatement of manager or head but not senior


[29-Oct-20 05:36 PM] ethan;#0003
he had months to put an inactive notice up


[29-Oct-20 05:37 PM] Polk#1596
Had enough chances


[29-Oct-20 05:37 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I wouldn‚Äôt say manager maybe head if we do consider adding him back but he‚Äôs had more than enough chances


[29-Oct-20 05:37 PM] courtney#5125
id consider nothing, he was demoted fairly. he did nothing for months without a notice, made excuses to hrs who talked to him abt it, continued to not make any efforts to improve after he was warned, was constantly on games and online, yet he thinks we‚Äôre the ones in the wrong?


[29-Oct-20 05:38 PM] courtney#5125
he was a senior for like


[29-Oct-20 05:38 PM] courtney#5125
a year or almost a year. pretty sure he‚Äôs had enough chances and he had sooo much time to genuinely improve. he made the choice not to, fair and square


[29-Oct-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
He didn‚Äôt even have an inactivity notice in august LOL


[29-Oct-20 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
It‚Äôs funny how he suddenly became active once he got demoted


[29-Oct-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
He was just inactive with no notice at all


[29-Oct-20 05:39 PM] courtney#5125
not to mention his constant rudeness towards other ppl on discord while he was an mr. definitely would hate to see such bad attitude return to the mr team


[29-Oct-20 05:40 PM] emily#4444
ya i agree w candy he had many chances


[29-Oct-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah no he is not becoming a senior again just to be inactive


[29-Oct-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
He was sent an inactivity notice letter and that was his chances


[29-Oct-20 05:41 PM] courtney#5125
ur demoted then ur demoted, u don‚Äôt get to come back with a rebut when ur rude and it was fair :/


[29-Oct-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
He just needs to move on and accept responsibility for his actions instead of making excuses


[29-Oct-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
This whole thing if his excuses is just comedy to me


[29-Oct-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs so funny


[29-Oct-20 05:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
He‚Äôll have more time to focus on his school work and what not now  or he can always rejoin and work as an LR and get promoted the fair way again ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[29-Oct-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125
if he‚Äôs sooooo busy with developing and school then id just love to see the major benefits he‚Äôll bring to the senior team once again ...


[29-Oct-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
He probably wants to become an MR again so he can get evidence to leak to people and create a tea doc


[29-Oct-20 05:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
^


[29-Oct-20 05:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Risky


[29-Oct-20 05:43 PM] courtney#5125
and advertise his dev stuff in his status again


[29-Oct-20 05:43 PM] courtney#5125
that was annoying üôÑ


[29-Oct-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah it was


[29-Oct-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
Like we have managers that deserve senior


[29-Oct-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
We don‚Äôt want to bring back an old inactive one when there are managers that can do 1000 times better then he can activity wise


[29-Oct-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
Like JJ


[29-Oct-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 if you are looking for people to promote I asked managers to post more people in promotion opinions jsyk if that helps


[29-Oct-20 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
I mean promotion suggestions


[29-Oct-20 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
ty!


[29-Oct-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; didnt u say u had concerns about megans activity before like i did


[29-Oct-20 07:53 PM] stacey#1000
I forget if u mentioned it before or not


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003
she is inactive


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003
very inactive


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
and shes been on among us


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
for like the past 3 hours


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
and been on roblox


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] ethan;#0003
she is online every day


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
so her notice is invalid


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
if u want u can make an inactive seniors card for her


[29-Oct-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
since the thing was announced


[29-Oct-20 07:55 PM] ethan;#0003
when was the last time she hosted?


[29-Oct-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000

[29-Oct-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000

oct 7th she assisted


[29-Oct-20 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
at a training


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] ethan;#0003
this is the last time she hosted her own server


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
the big question is


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
whens the last time she hosted for someone thats not me?


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
she is biased


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] courtney#5125
shes never hosted for me before


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
yes im good friends with her but like


[29-Oct-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
she shouldnt only host for me


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
and shes not doing anything rn period


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
august 12th


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
she hosted for fraux


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
so she should be sent a legit notice


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
I think its time she get sent an inactive notice


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
ive had enough convos with her regarding her activity


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
she was a little active in august hosted 11 sessions


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003
before that was june 3rd


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
but that was like


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
2 months ago right?


[29-Oct-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
so


[29-Oct-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
what do you think, give it more time or just get the inactive notice rolling


[29-Oct-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
?*


[29-Oct-20 07:58 PM] ethan;#0003
her notice ends on november 1st


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
oh yeah true


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
if she puts another one up after then id probs put her on inactive thing


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
because that would be 2 months without hosing


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
longer then doge i think


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
ok so just keep an eye on her I just wanted to know your thoughts since I know you are concerned about her activity like me


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
but her notice is only from october the start of it


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] ethan;#0003
doesnt explain all of september without hosting once


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
if she makes a new notice


[29-Oct-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
and is inactive at bloxton but still active on other games

Oh he uses his moms


[29-Oct-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
megan is busy with drama and stuff but if she has time to do among us for 3 hours she can at least do 2 sessions a week


[29-Oct-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
she was on it last night too


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
drew hosted 2 times this month


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000

[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
and last week he got 25% on his checklist


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
at least he is doing stuff


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
megan assisted at 1 training


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
all month


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
thats it


[29-Oct-20 08:02 PM] ethan;#0003
if drew cant do shifts and sessions we should probs recommend him to help with applications


[29-Oct-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
he can do apps on mobile yea


[29-Oct-20 08:03 PM] ethan;#0003
and quwanterz should be getting active again soon


[29-Oct-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
legit im done with reminding megan to do stuff


[29-Oct-20 08:03 PM] ethan;#0003
since he is now he is settled down in school


[29-Oct-20 08:03 PM] ethan;#0003
he told me the other day he has more free time now


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
thats good


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
so the only senior concerning rn is


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
megan really


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Omg I kinda forgot about Quwanterz he kinda went off of the radar at the end of august


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
and fvarr


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
i forgot fvarr was even a senior


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
isnt she like


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
sgt timezone


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
she has never been active


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah but she has never been active


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
since she got senior


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
and i  promoted her


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
true


[29-Oct-20 08:04 PM] ethan;#0003
and i remember thinking that i never see her


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
I never see her either


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
any senior card with less then 20 comments


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
we should look into


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
other then quwanterz and drew since they have reasons


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
shes doing stuff tho


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
she got 100 percent last week


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
and did stuff this week


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
so its probably just her timezone that u dont see her


[29-Oct-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] ethan;#0003
probs


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I kinda forgot about emm_yy but looking at her activity card she seems to be doing some stuff at least


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
yeah fvarr is fine


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
megan is the only one that majorly concerns me


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
shes gone through training for firstone


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
and has applied to work there


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
and yet does nothing at bloxton


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] ethan;#0003
seniors  i dont see are emmy, kiki, megan


[29-Oct-20 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
yeah kiki is really inactive rn too


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] ethan;#0003
omg like a year ago i think she almost got senior instead of you


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] ethan;#0003
LOL


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Kikis notice ran out a few days ago


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Actually


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] ethan;#0003
but she went super inactive for like 2 weeks


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I just noticed


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] ethan;#0003
last time kiki hosted was august 16th


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
thats like more inactive then megan


[29-Oct-20 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
yikes


[29-Oct-20 08:08 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Oct-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000

she was so active when I promoted her


[29-Oct-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
her old card has 200 comments


[29-Oct-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
is it sad that megan has never had over 200 comments


[29-Oct-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
on any card


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
bruh


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
I think it is shes been a senior over a year


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
REALLY?


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah

[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
out of every senior she concerns me the most


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
megan has always had issues with activity


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
i brought it up before


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000

[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Omg the last time Megan hosted for me was in may :FlushedEgg:


[29-Oct-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
oml


[29-Oct-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
Idc that im good friends with her she has no excuse for not being active if she can play among us for 3-4 hours in one day


[29-Oct-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
shes just holding up a senior spot at this point


[29-Oct-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000

LOL WTF


[29-Oct-20 09:11 PM] ethan;#0003
the former mr das_ies sent me an appeal 



I‚Äôve been blacklisted since January 2019. This is almost 2 years. During this time I have done a lot of things that were considerably worse but I have became a lot more mature. My proof being that firstly, I have not even had anything to do with Bloxton which is negative for the last few months. I have sent a lot of reports of people who needed to be fired with a lot of evidence so that it could be dealt with and if I didn‚Äôt want to be part of the community again I simply would not do this. I am not really a toxic person and since I have been improving Bloxton wise I have apologised to many people who I trolled or did bad things to in the community and have moved on or even became friends with them. I have changed so much in the last few months and I just want a chance to prove this, and I would not blow it after all of this time. Most importantly I honestly have nothing against bloxton and have tried so hard to come back whereas before I would constantly troll and then say I want to come back and go full circle, but this just does not happen anymore. I have changed my ways because I haven‚Äôt CBed, caused drama or made any sort of inconvenience really in the community for several months, and I honestly just want to be able to come back to the disc server so that I can speak to my friends and also show that my bad record of things that happened from before is not how I act now

[29-Oct-20 10:23 PM] courtney#5125
i mean its an interesting complainttttt


[29-Oct-20 10:24 PM] courtney#5125
its only 10:30 and 11:30 for them tho lol so idk why its that big of a surprise theyre awake. its first come first serve, though. its not like we can go through every single seniors card at every session that they ask for just to see if theyve hosted "a lot" or not compared to however many other seniors


[29-Oct-20 10:25 PM] courtney#5125
and the seniors that get servers that havent formed are more than welcome to assist or they can co-host too, so its still easy to get credit even if youre not the only host if a server


[29-Oct-20 10:26 PM] courtney#5125
and its not exactly rushing to get in a server, i usually look at the server list to see whos in a server and people are always in their servers 5-10 minutes early


[29-Oct-20 10:26 PM] stacey#1000
she was gonna send me that but then said nvm


[29-Oct-20 10:27 PM] courtney#5125
idk how she can blame people just for being up in "her time". makes little to no sense :/


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
I mean


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
when I host


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
and I get 2-4 seniors asking me to host like earlier


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
and I know ace hosted a second server for me already for example


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
ill give the second server to another senior


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
and let ace co-host


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
so like you shouldnt be going by who dms you first


[29-Oct-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
thats not fair


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
you should consider if you know another senior hosted for you


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
and another one asks that hasnt


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i do a similar thing because jess asks super quickly like every single time. but its not like i can give jess the fifth server and give someone who asked 10 minutes late the first server


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
to give that chance to someone else


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
im meaning if they all ask at the same time


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] courtney#5125
but im also not going to look through everyones card of who asked and see how often theyve hosted on that particular day


[29-Oct-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
if someone asks 10 mins later obv they shouldnt expect a second server


[29-Oct-20 10:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Last time madi hosted for me was like 10/02/20, and I do about 5 sessions a week.


[29-Oct-20 10:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
10/02/20 was the last message ever sent to her from me.


[29-Oct-20 11:15 PM] courtney#5125
i mean its definitely something ill keep an eye out for; making sure that if one senior has hosted multiple times for me in a day, then ill give them the third or fourth. but she cant blame seniors just for being awake and asking in her supposed claimed timezone !


[29-Oct-20 11:15 PM] courtney#5125
and its not really rushing when u get there 5 to 10+ minutes early, but i understand part of her argument there


[30-Oct-20 06:58 AM] xM_inn#2821

@stacey megan has time to help build for the theme session, but doesnt have time to host. That really says something...


[30-Oct-20 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
mhm


[30-Oct-20 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
she does have time to host


[30-Oct-20 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
but doesnt for some reason


[30-Oct-20 05:33 PM] ethan;#0003
she just chooses not to


[30-Oct-20 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
she needs to be sent an inactive notice as a wake up call


[30-Oct-20 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
im not being the one that sends it tho


[30-Oct-20 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
she legit would not listen to me


[30-Oct-20 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
i can send it


[30-Oct-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
can u add her to inactive MRs


[30-Oct-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
so we can vote on it and get a start on it at least


[30-Oct-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
add Kiki too


[30-Oct-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; also yknow shes only here cause shes host bias right


[30-Oct-20 05:36 PM] ethan;#0003
oh i knew that already


[30-Oct-20 05:36 PM] ethan;#0003
its so obvious


[30-Oct-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
can that be in her inactive notice or no


[30-Oct-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
cause like


[30-Oct-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
its not an official rule is it


[30-Oct-20 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
but like it should be obv she shouldnt host for just me


[30-Oct-20 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
bruhhhh she's building ? üíÄ


[30-Oct-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000

[30-Oct-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
shes building but not hosting


[30-Oct-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
and again only here cause its my session :/


[30-Oct-20 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
if someone wants to talk to her about being host bias they can but trust me i aint the person to do it


[30-Oct-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
because im close to her she wont listen


[31-Oct-20 12:35 AM] courtney#5125

[31-Oct-20 12:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Because, I just did a search on their name on trello and it came up as one of your interview cards.


[31-Oct-20 12:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
which they should of contacted a long time ago.


[31-Oct-20 12:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
