please


[01-Apr-21 12:11 AM] xM_inn#2821

Yes do it


[01-Apr-21 12:13 AM] babymariobebe#7563
alright LOL


[01-Apr-21 12:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
if you wanted to change the role colours to trick people and confuse them for the day you could do something like:

BOD - Bright Blue

General Manager - Bright Pink

Shift Manager - Bright Green

Senior Management - Bright Yellow

Management - Bright Red

Heads - Bright Orange

LRs - Bright Purple

Talkative - Dark Grey / Maybe Black?

of course just dont forget to change them back to the original role colours after april fools is over


[01-Apr-21 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
Management= Mangoes


[01-Apr-21 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
Idk


[01-Apr-21 12:15 AM] Polk#1596
If u change the role colors make sure to save the color codes before u do


[01-Apr-21 12:15 AM] Polk#1596
I'd be heartbroken to lose the bod color üò≠


[01-Apr-21 12:15 AM] Polk#1596
but yes that would be really funny LOL


[01-Apr-21 12:16 AM] stacey#1000
Can we change general Manager role colour permanently after it‚Äôs too close to honor member role color and people keep thinking i resigned


[01-Apr-21 12:17 AM] Fraux#7971
All colors need an update it‚Äôs been too long ü•≥


[01-Apr-21 12:17 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'll put all colour codes for our current role colours in #hotel


[01-Apr-21 12:18 AM] Polk#1596
I'd rather change the honor member color instead


[01-Apr-21 12:18 AM] Polk#1596
I really like all MR+ colors


[01-Apr-21 12:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yea


[01-Apr-21 12:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
It'd be confusing if we changed the role colours permanently imo


[01-Apr-21 12:19 AM] xM_inn#2821
but it'd be funny for april fools to make them completely different along with the role name changes


[01-Apr-21 12:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
I need sleep gn


[01-Apr-21 12:21 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah just change honor member role to a green similar to former MR role then


[01-Apr-21 12:21 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs too close to gm role color


[01-Apr-21 12:23 AM] courtney#5125

[01-Apr-21 12:31 AM] Polk#1596
But it would be hilarious if we turned the colors upside down by having baby give us the LR colors or something for 24 hours


[01-Apr-21 12:47 AM] babymariobebe#7563

well, she is probably never getting shift manager at this point yeah


[03-Apr-21 04:28 PM] stacey#1000

@bonnie591 speaks well for reasons why on card


[03-Apr-21 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
If she got shift she would cause a lot of drama I think


[03-Apr-21 04:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
the thing is we have the best hr team rn


[03-Apr-21 04:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
like


[03-Apr-21 04:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
the best ive seen


[03-Apr-21 04:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
if we hired her


[03-Apr-21 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like if imag got shift


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
There would be drama like when Emma was here


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
sorry but it would ruin it and it may go back to the atmosphere of bman and emma


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
acel and drizzle


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
would be perfect, they wouldnt cause drama


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
i honestly dont want to hire just one of them


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
id rather do 2 or none! they both deserve it equally


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
I really want both of them yes


[03-Apr-21 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
One for BST and for EST


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
Both of them are so active


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
BST morning and EST night lacks sessions


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
I can never host later at night


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe drizzle is a lazy teen and gets up at mid day but whatever


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
I host 6-7 est. after that no


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
acel probs wont be late night either but u know maybe


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they could


[03-Apr-21 04:31 PM] bonnie591#0591

[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591

[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont have a problem with anyone here! yes that means i dont have a problem with u either lyss


[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
Yes Jess is so nice and respectful I want to see her as HR so bad. And drizzle is so active and kind as well I remember when I promoted her to rank 8, she‚Äôs never had issues


[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
and drizzle ethan!


[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] ethan;#0003
idk drizzle


[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] ethan;#0003
ive never spoken to her


[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] emily#4444
dont do what i do omg


[03-Apr-21 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah timezone differences


[03-Apr-21 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
Drizzle and Jess always ask to host for me


[03-Apr-21 04:34 PM] stacey#1000
They are the only seniors I see that go beyond their requirements


[03-Apr-21 04:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
we just gotta be careful not to understaff seniors but im sure emma and addie will be able to staff senior well, and maybe even tati if the founders allow it


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
but if we can only get 1 shift manager, id rather wait till we get 2 tbh


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
it would be so unfair to just hire one


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] cory!#8287
yes ace for shift


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
Yes Emma and Addie would do great they are my top 2 pick rn for senior


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] cory!#8287
I hosted 3 sessions yesterday and she asked to host for all of them


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] lyss#0709
i forgot, are we not having jackie for senior now?


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
jackie did something


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
Jc6kii lost my vote because of the way he talks to LRs


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
it wasnt like major but defo not this time


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
It was announced recently


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] lyss#0709
right, yeah


[03-Apr-21 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
If he‚Äôs rude and disrespectful to LRs he needs more time


[03-Apr-21 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
So I vote Addie and Emma and if we are allowed 3, then Tati as well


[03-Apr-21 04:36 PM] lyss#0709
well, they arent rude and disrespectful to lrs, i just know they kind of struggle with certain things like that but it still isnt an excuse


[03-Apr-21 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
I mean not majorly rude but like


[03-Apr-21 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
Just the way he speaks to them sometimes doesn‚Äôt look good


[03-Apr-21 04:37 PM] cory!#8287
im def gonna vote emma and prob tati since I see her more than addie


[03-Apr-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
they are still good, but when theres a tight competition between 4 people for senior it sets them apart


[03-Apr-21 04:37 PM] stacey#1000
^^


[03-Apr-21 04:37 PM] stacey#1000
I agree deciding between Addie and Tati is hard too. I see both of them all the time


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
But if we only allowed 2 I might vote Tati over Addie as well because Tati has been a manager over a year and I see her all the time


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
3 please @Hilton Founder üôè


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
She was also inactive for a bit too


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] lyss#0709
if it was between tati and addie id probably want tati first


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think we gotta wait to get more heads first tho


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs so hard!!


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
like reach the rank limit


[03-Apr-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591

If anyone wants a head to be promoted then feel free to add a head opinion promo card thing to the list. There's currently one spot available.


[05-Apr-21 06:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
If anyones promotion due date needs an extension feel free to dm me


[05-Apr-21 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
After this card is added and the other people are also promoted, we will be at the rank limit


[05-Apr-21 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
I will try and get us a senior vote and shift vote once we reach that


[05-Apr-21 06:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
As a short term solution to our full head ranks, we will use the same tactic as senior votes, just like we implemented with manager promotions


[05-Apr-21 06:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
So we can choose the best people for the position


[05-Apr-21 06:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
But this can be considered as the last normal card method, so whoever puts it on first gets it, make sure they are hard working!

[06-Apr-21 07:22 PM] lyss#0709
he just does it to be nice


[06-Apr-21 07:22 PM] ethan;#0003
he keeps hitting on the female mrs in these messages


[06-Apr-21 07:22 PM] ethan;#0003
every session


[06-Apr-21 07:23 PM] lyss#0709
its not just towards the females, he just seems to pick a random person and compliment them


[06-Apr-21 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
idk maybe, but at my sessions its just been females


[06-Apr-21 07:24 PM] lyss#0709
im sure his intentions are completely platonic, at least from what i have seen


[06-Apr-21 07:24 PM] ethan;#0003

Question, am I allowed to host a public toontown gamenight? I ask because you have to download something to actually play the game, such as like downloading the loader for roblox


[09-Apr-21 11:38 AM] bonnie591#0591
as long as its not sketchy sure


[09-Apr-21 03:22 PM] Fraux#7971

[10-Apr-21 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
theres no owner status on trello so


[10-Apr-21 03:28 PM] stacey#1000

nope


[10-Apr-21 06:46 PM] cory!#8287
added some inactive managers on the hr board if yall wanna leave ur opinions on them!


[10-Apr-21 06:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ty


[10-Apr-21 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
If these 2 cards get 5 votes, who would be interested in sending letters?


[10-Apr-21 08:07 PM] courtney#5125
me me me


[10-Apr-21 08:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk about the removing tools because dont we allow other staff to work at their non-traineed jobs with permission? Or im tripping


[10-Apr-21 08:28 PM] cory!#8287
I can do one


[10-Apr-21 08:29 PM] cory!#8287
yes I agree with cats suggestion if someone would be willing to make that


[10-Apr-21 08:31 PM] cory!#8287
and for Emma‚Äôs I think the way we do trainings is fine atm. All the stuff she talked abt is usually in training guides and the helper gives them questions abt when you should use the tools, when to give warnings, etc.


[10-Apr-21 08:31 PM] cory!#8287
it‚Äôs mainly the trainees fault for not paying attention or forgetting ig


[10-Apr-21 08:32 PM] courtney#5125
yess i was thinking itd be cool to have that kind of thing programmed for the interface. for training, idk i mean its not fair to be that strict, we're trying to employ them after all. if they dont do their job well then theyll face consequences, and if they have questions then they should ask. taking the time to gather evidence for staff members and report them each shift is unavoidable, some people just dont want to play the game properly


[11-Apr-21 05:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
@courtney @cory! assigned to an inactive manager. Send a notice, they have a week to respond. If they respond screenshot the response, put it on the card and notify me please. Thanks for offering to do it!


[11-Apr-21 07:31 AM] cory!#8287
alrighty!


[11-Apr-21 06:02 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 so we can change rules?


[11-Apr-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yup


[11-Apr-21 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 can you make the muted role not be able to see questions


[11-Apr-21 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
cause they are just causing stuff in questions channel now


[11-Apr-21 06:10 PM] stacey#1000
ok im going back to my schoolwork have fun


[11-Apr-21 06:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Trying to do it


[11-Apr-21 06:44 PM] cory!#8287
gotta love it when all those people that got muted are dming me about why they were muted and if i can remove their warnings ü§ó


[11-Apr-21 06:44 PM] stacey#1000
I think we need an HR meeting to discuss all this stuff


[11-Apr-21 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
regarding muting, warnings, banning, etc for discord server


[11-Apr-21 06:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
Indeed, plus we could re structure rules and info


[11-Apr-21 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll work on something, bring it to the meeting and see what y'all think


[11-Apr-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
we also need to discuss stuff we announce in the discord


[11-Apr-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
im done my course on wednesday so anytime after that is good for me for a meeting


[11-Apr-21 06:49 PM] stacey#1000
ill announce something for a meeting to get an idea of when people are available


[11-Apr-21 06:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure


[11-Apr-21 06:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll bring a proposal thing and like an idea on how rules and info should look


[11-Apr-21 06:51 PM] cory!#8287
is bloo still gonna make that moderation guide for managers


[11-Apr-21 06:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm gonna draft something


[11-Apr-21 06:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Similar kinda


[11-Apr-21 06:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
We'll see


[11-Apr-21 06:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Polk is typing....


[11-Apr-21 06:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Rules and info and the FAQ needs to be redone tbh


[11-Apr-21 06:55 PM] Polk#1596
some MRs told me that drama went down in general once again, i know you guys already dealt with it but i just wanna say after this i am NEVER announcing something unrelated to bloxton again with maybe the exception of new years. i highly suggest you guys dont make the same mistake as me because this drama initially started with how i announced prince philip's death a few days ago. they dont have the decency to respect things like that, nor understand the intention of it being announced (which was obviously to pay respect as a large portion of our community is from the UK), and they start bringing up completely irrelevant things to make us look bad. i dont want any more of that, so please dont make the same mistake as me and only announce such things at ur own risk. it will most likely only stir up drama and make general discussion toxic

some people who are walking on thin ice right now are people like:
aidannnx, uyzeia, caatgirl, dazaisu
please keep an eye on them if they're talking smack in general (sorry for the ping) @High Rank


[11-Apr-21 06:56 PM] Polk#1596
once we're doing that i can update it to look more like our trello


[11-Apr-21 06:56 PM] cory!#8287
i mean we could announce like a little paragraph for special holidays and not ping for it


[11-Apr-21 06:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
uhhh what?


[11-Apr-21 06:56 PM] Polk#1596
if you guys didnt know


[11-Apr-21 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk an MR is dming me a bunch of evidence to get all those people banned and im making a doc with all evidence and will post to get a vote on banning them all soon


[11-Apr-21 06:56 PM] cory!#8287
since theyre all mad we dont announce ramadan and stuff


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] Polk#1596
i spent half of my evening the other day talking some sense into these kids


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] Polk#1596
and they think of me as some sort of villain because of it


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
People pressed that you made a paragraph to pay respects to a dead royal man (not to be rude)


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
?


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk those are all the people harassing me over not banning someone and saying i dont support trans people and call of transphobia minor, they are on thin ice for sure


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] Polk#1596
you can, but if you miss something you'll probably get called racist or whatever over some religion you forgot


[11-Apr-21 06:57 PM] Polk#1596
i just cant be bothered with it anymore


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] cory!#8287
but yeah idk why they madw a whole deal outta u announcing his death üòê


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
alright that is good


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Should we make a resources channel instead of putting everything in rules and info


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Makes it messy


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
pretty much yeah


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
once i announced it


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
everything popped off


[11-Apr-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
"he was racist" "he was a nazi"


[11-Apr-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
and they kept making the same joke over and over again for 30 minutes "if jello touched him he would dissolve"


[11-Apr-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
its alright to joke but they tried speaking for everyone else saying nobody cared


[11-Apr-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
at that point it just got really offensive


[11-Apr-21 06:59 PM] cory!#8287
yeah theyre just disrespectful and cause drama


[11-Apr-21 07:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
what happened in general today?


[11-Apr-21 07:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
there was more drama?


[11-Apr-21 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
i heard there was more drama


[11-Apr-21 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
i dont wanna check because i know its already gonna be stupid


[11-Apr-21 07:00 PM] Polk#1596
but its the same people causing drama


[11-Apr-21 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
the thing about them isnt how theyre disrespectful, that is a mistake everyone makes and its okay if you realize it & apologize accordingly


[11-Apr-21 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
its how they value their own opinions up until the point where everyone elses opinion is just pure trash to them


[11-Apr-21 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
and they think theyre always in the right


[11-Apr-21 07:01 PM] Polk#1596
thats where it begins to get toxic


[11-Apr-21 07:02 PM] Polk#1596
i was told bonnie dealt with it so u can ask him


[11-Apr-21 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
I allowed managers to just mute them


[11-Apr-21 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
For 5 hours


[11-Apr-21 07:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
If they continue after then ban


[11-Apr-21 08:26 PM] ethan;#0003

[11-Apr-21 08:26 PM] stacey#1000

[11-Apr-21 08:27 PM] Beartikal#9760

[11-Apr-21 08:27 PM] Beartikal#9760

I know how im gonna check Mxstake2 for safechat.


[13-Apr-21 01:49 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm gonna wait til she goes to training. Before it starts. I'm going to make everyone line up in the lobby


[13-Apr-21 01:51 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Name all "Bloxton", check Mxstake, make a server message saying "One of you might be getting a promotion." then leave the server to make them all nervous.


[13-Apr-21 01:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
ooo nice


[13-Apr-21 01:52 AM] KjRBLX#2053
If any of you see Mxstake2, let me know.


[13-Apr-21 02:06 AM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL, one thing I like to do is look back at the chat when I got promoted to shift and see all the people be like "WHO IS KJ?!?!"


[13-Apr-21 02:06 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I get such a good laugh out of it.

@High Rank So uh I updated Dark after ranking him to Head of Services and the bot auto-banned him for being the ALT of a banned user, I'm not too sure how long ago this was or if the account even still exists but I'll look into it a little more. For now, I'll unban and let him back in the server. Something to keep an eye on though. https://gyazo.com/f5102a05c2858a78713b7bb458529d48

I mean, major spamming isn't that serious to be fair


[13-Apr-21 04:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
There's no date so it's probs ages ago


[13-Apr-21 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
And we don't know how long ago it was


[13-Apr-21 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah


[13-Apr-21 04:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Wait


[13-Apr-21 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's whatever, I'll just let him back in but it's definitely something to watch for


[13-Apr-21 04:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Let me try something one sec

Can someone get the id of the banned account. Just go to bans and search 1f84


[13-Apr-21 04:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053

Ah


[13-Apr-21 04:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
It looks like he made a new Discord account to bypass his original ban I guess


[13-Apr-21 04:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
Either way, it's now a year later and I'd like to think he's changed


[13-Apr-21 04:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
lol i would mess with him and make him appeal


[13-Apr-21 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hope so, but someone to keep an eye on and if we consider him for manager


[13-Apr-21 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
But we should probabaly update people before we promote them in future just to be sure


[13-Apr-21 04:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I wonder what he spammed


[13-Apr-21 04:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll go check kj and Stacey's promo


[13-Apr-21 04:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
thank god i didn't make the game public yet


[13-Apr-21 04:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
I wonder what he spammed too however


[13-Apr-21 04:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
He was housekeeping when he was banned


[13-Apr-21 04:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
and he's still housekeeping now


[13-Apr-21 04:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
So unless there's any fire records, I don't think anyone filed a termination request


[13-Apr-21 04:43 PM] ethan;#0003
its the same account


[13-Apr-21 04:43 PM] ethan;#0003
same roblox account


[13-Apr-21 04:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't think it's a major concern, it was just a bit surprising when he was got banned üíÄ poor general discussion though I updated him in there and then he vanished, everyone was confused


[13-Apr-21 04:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah that‚Äôs a little awkward


[13-Apr-21 04:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lol


[13-Apr-21 04:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[13-Apr-21 04:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
Dark went to sleep I think, so he should be in the Discord whenever he wakes up


[13-Apr-21 04:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
Btw

aren't seniors only allowed to host 2 games a day for game nights?


[14-Apr-21 10:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
if ur referring to madi hosting 3 today, thats allowed since they were consecutive and had no gaps between them. if she hosted another one now and another later, then thats when it breaks guidelines


[14-Apr-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
bruh


[14-Apr-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003

that his main account got appealed here


[14-Apr-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
but idk what his main is

he is now exploiting in firestone üòê

[14-Apr-21 08:40 PM] courtney#5125
soooo display names were released in some areas, not to everyone, but still some people have access to that update now. wont that make it difficult for managers to name staff members at training, since it just shows a user's display name on the leaderboard?

@courtney we having the meeting on Saturday at 2 est so I think bring this topic to meeting to discuss


[14-Apr-21 08:56 PM] courtney#5125
noted!


[14-Apr-21 10:41 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah, unfortunately that's a core script, so roblox forces that onto us unless we develop a custom leaderboard. Normally this would change the name above their head too, but with our system it uses player.Name not player.DisplayName. So if you look at their character you can do that then. We may add a spot for their display name too because people might want support for that, but because of room giving and trollers/impersonators we will always ensure their real name is displayed.


[14-Apr-21 11:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What might be helpful is a new gui. There are 5 pages. Trainee, Housekeeping, Bartender, Security, Receptionist. Users are auto sorted by their ranks on these pages and with their actual usernames.

If you want to go deeper with it, add a teleport button beside each name. Maybe a picture of the character beside the persons name too.


[14-Apr-21 11:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It would also help for some who use the command bar. When you use the command bar, it resets the scroll position of the leaderboard so u tend to loose track of where u started.


[15-Apr-21 12:00 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Tbh, roblox should of made a way to disable it for the games


[15-Apr-21 01:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
@bonnie591 I go to in person school. I get out of school right at 3:00 PM CST/4:00 PM CST, but I won't get into the house until like at most maybe 3:10 PM CST. So I might be a few minutes late, if it happens today.

I‚Äôm gonna block him too


[15-Apr-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I already told him before he can‚Äôt appeal and he‚Äôs heard it from many other HRs and doesn‚Äôt need me to tell him the same thing


[15-Apr-21 05:26 PM] ethan;#0003
ive told him that before that if he was to ever get unbanned he wouldnt be welcomed


[15-Apr-21 08:18 PM] stacey#1000
If someone named Dev_Natzepp#5071 dms any of you for a ban appeal dont appeal him

is it just me or do mrs literally race through interviews just to get done and go to training faster. ive had mrs ask me to leave for training before its even allowed for them to attend


[16-Apr-21 09:55 AM] courtney#5125
ill get mrs that try to finish within a few minutes of starting and then ask to leave for training right after


[16-Apr-21 10:02 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I make everyone wait atleast xx:30 to leave. Idk why tho


[16-Apr-21 10:03 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I just feel u should atleast stay thru like most of the session.


[16-Apr-21 10:08 AM] courtney#5125
yeah i agree. itd be one thing if they were naturally finishing quickly once in a while, but a lot of them speed through it every single time

[17-Apr-21 04:36 AM] bonnie591#0591
If an MR doesn't follow pms at sessions more than once, then feel free to just issue them a warning and log it in #warnings


[17-Apr-21 04:37 AM] bonnie591#0591
If its ever just a one off with an mr though, just remind them. But repeated offense is warnings, which will eventually lead to a suspension once they achieve 3

[17-Apr-21 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
to clear all warnings you need to use ?clearwarn


[17-Apr-21 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
to clear one warning you need to do ?warnings user and then ?delwarn [warningid]


[17-Apr-21 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey


[17-Apr-21 02:13 PM] bonnie591#0591

we cant have a lot of uniforms for every gender identity


[17-Apr-21 02:59 PM] ethan;#0003
what is gender dysmorphia


[17-Apr-21 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
people can wear whatever one they want


[17-Apr-21 02:59 PM] stacey#1000
if we did a uniform for every gender identity it would be too many


[17-Apr-21 02:59 PM] cory!#8287

ok so


[17-Apr-21 03:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
shall we do the 2 other things first before we discuss our main topic?


[17-Apr-21 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
can I just say my idea first


[17-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[17-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
go ahead


[17-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
and include the addition of the username thing too!


[17-Apr-21 03:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
we can rename inactivity-notices to mr-notices


[17-Apr-21 03:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes that would be helpful if they changed their username to something stupid


[17-Apr-21 03:07 PM] anna#0004
ya that sounds good


[17-Apr-21 03:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[17-Apr-21 03:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
okay so what baby said was the reason why they dont really want senior/shift votes is because they are really busy with college now and they'd rather be here to oversee the group and stuff. they said they should be more available in may so ill ask again in a few weeks

ok!


[17-Apr-21 03:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
heads arent really in need of a vote since spots open very frequently for them and theres not as many who really deserve it compared to managers. so whenever a head spot is available feel free to still do the old way @stacey


[17-Apr-21 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591

[17-Apr-21 03:26 PM] ethan;#0003

[17-Apr-21 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh and if a user hits like 9 warnings all together (excluding report warnings) then they can be banned


[17-Apr-21 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
to make the mutes work, we wont kick at 3 and 6 warnings anymore because we are basically muting someone and then just kicking them


[17-Apr-21 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
some rule violations include kicks anyway


[17-Apr-21 03:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[17-Apr-21 03:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
for rule 3, what consequence do you guys think should happen at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd offense etc


[17-Apr-21 03:35 PM] cory!#8287
I‚Äôll show an example


[17-Apr-21 03:35 PM] ethan;#0003
mute then kick


[17-Apr-21 03:35 PM] ethan;#0003
then ban


[17-Apr-21 03:36 PM] ethan;#0003

will do! i might discuss it with the managers too to make sure they agree with it. if you have any spare time id recommend doing them picture things or whatever and ill let u know when im done!


[17-Apr-21 03:38 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 rule 3 should be a mute kick or ban based on how severe it is


[17-Apr-21 03:39 PM] ethan;#0003
up to the descression of the person giving them the punishment


[17-Apr-21 03:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think if its like major discrimination and stuff then they should be banned


[17-Apr-21 03:39 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah based on the severity of it


[17-Apr-21 03:39 PM] Polk#1596

if its just insulting people and stuff then maybe warn and mute first then if repeated banned

[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] Polk#1596
its kinda funny because she is literally just restating my rules


[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] Polk#1596
as i was going thorugh them


[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] stacey#1000
no


[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] cory!#8287
yes every single head does that i think


[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] katie#0200

[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] Polk#1596

[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] Polk#1596
i mean its not that big of a deal


[17-Apr-21 03:50 PM] cory!#8287
yes whenever I host sessions I always see them do that


[17-Apr-21 03:51 PM] Polk#1596
but they are taking away the attention from our rules


[17-Apr-21 03:51 PM] Polk#1596
and we are saying the exact same thing


[17-Apr-21 03:51 PM] Polk#1596
so its like just unnecessary


[17-Apr-21 03:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wait ive never had a head do that at my session LOL


[17-Apr-21 03:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
That was so frustrating


[17-Apr-21 03:51 PM] xM_inn#2821

[17-Apr-21 03:54 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Apr-21 03:54 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] Polk#1596

[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i find theme sessions stressful tbh. they're fun in the end but making sure all the builders get there and we get done on time stresses me out lol


[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] cory!#8287
I let just seniors and some experienced managers help at my st. Patrick‚Äôs day themed session and it was super organized and coordinated


[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
and caused drama over not undoing stuff


[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] Polk#1596
im coming


[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk look at chatlogs then look at pansy chatlogs


[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
you can see her begging for people to undo stuff


[17-Apr-21 03:55 PM] cory!#8287
it‚Äôs probably one of the heads


[17-Apr-21 03:56 PM] cory!#8287
Or inexperienced btools builders


[17-Apr-21 03:56 PM] stacey#1000

@KjRBLX Hi! Since you added the blacklist, what are your opinions on vickysglow's appeal? https://trello.com/c/SJ8kk4LG/1423-vickysglow-489288518 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/482532745801629696/831976223735283722/Screenshot_2021-04-14_at_21.36.09.png

That‚Äôs funny but idgaf. I‚Äôm bi whether people believe it or not.


[18-Apr-21 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
@cory! what discord server is that in


[18-Apr-21 09:04 AM] cory!#8287
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a discord server I think it‚Äôs a gc


[18-Apr-21 09:04 AM] cory!#8287
cuz pansy sent me that proof


[18-Apr-21 09:04 AM] stacey#1000
Lol


[18-Apr-21 09:05 AM] stacey#1000
This is why Wyatt or whatever their name is are banned from the discord server


[18-Apr-21 09:07 AM] cory!#8287
they‚Äôll probably never change either


[18-Apr-21 09:11 AM] stacey#1000
Probs not. There is always fake people that think they are better then everyone and assume stuff about people.


[18-Apr-21 09:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Looks good to me, really good. Hopefully the others have learned the consequences of their actions too.


[18-Apr-21 09:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
Okay ty I'll unblacklist.


[18-Apr-21 10:15 AM] cory!#8287

Who are these folks anyway


[18-Apr-21 10:32 AM] stacey#1000
Get their discord name and tags so we can make sure they are banned from the discord with no appeal


[18-Apr-21 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
I knew there would be people that would be upset over her promotion but there is always someone upset over every promotion


[18-Apr-21 11:25 AM] cory!#8287
cj is casonmusicstar


[18-Apr-21 11:25 AM] cory!#8287
and briana is vbri_anna


[18-Apr-21 11:25 AM] cory!#8287
the rest are already banned


[18-Apr-21 11:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
vbri_anna...


[18-Apr-21 11:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
isnt that..


[18-Apr-21 11:26 AM] KjRBLX#2053
heard that name before


[18-Apr-21 11:26 AM] cory!#8287
she‚Äôs a former mr


[18-Apr-21 11:27 AM] KjRBLX#2053
thought so but wasnt too sure


[18-Apr-21 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! pansy is new so if she gets consequences just give her a verbal warning reminder


[18-Apr-21 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
she hasnt been an mr for even a week so


[18-Apr-21 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
shes only been an MR for like 2-3 days so she is likely not aware


[18-Apr-21 04:48 PM] cory!#8287
i wasnt gonna give her anything it was mainly canary that did the abusing


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
it looked like it was mostly pansy and canary


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
is that at my interviews rn?


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] cory!#8287
no it was at mine


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'd suggest warning would be best


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
ok I would do a written warning for canary then


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
shes been an MR long enough to know


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
but I would at least message pansy as well


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
not like warn her


[18-Apr-21 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
just remind her so she knows


[18-Apr-21 04:50 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[18-Apr-21 04:50 PM] cory!#8287
does anyone wanna send the warning to canary since im making the announcement?


[18-Apr-21 04:51 PM] cory!#8287
and the reminder to pansy


[18-Apr-21 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
im hosting my own int rn


[18-Apr-21 04:51 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Apr-21 04:51 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[18-Apr-21 05:34 PM] cory!#8287
sent canary her formal warning & reminded pansy


[18-Apr-21 06:33 PM] cory!#8287
they have amazing responses in their application, but idk much about their group history or background


[18-Apr-21 06:34 PM] katie#0200

[18-Apr-21 06:34 PM] katie#0200

Second game was that paranormica game I believe. I've seen that background before


[19-Apr-21 03:59 PM] cory!#8287
id look into that more


[19-Apr-21 03:59 PM] cory!#8287
considering people can probably impersonate him with display names


[19-Apr-21 03:59 PM] cory!#8287
not sure if people can do that


[19-Apr-21 03:59 PM] cory!#8287
but


[19-Apr-21 04:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think with display names, the username still shows up in chat


[19-Apr-21 04:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Now, I remember Canary bypassed in some laundromat game. It was let go. Now, I think Jaiden would be let off too, but the second image.........


[19-Apr-21 04:01 PM] cory!#8287
yeah he said a slur which is.... bad!


[19-Apr-21 04:02 PM] cory!#8287
idk how these display names work or anything so it could be him but idk


[19-Apr-21 04:03 PM] cory!#8287
it seems out of his personality for him to say that in my opinion


[19-Apr-21 04:04 PM] cory!#8287
but i could be wrong!


[19-Apr-21 04:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah, I've heard someone say once that its sad that you guys aren't in the loop because you're HRs, don't remember quite who said it tho

[19-Apr-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! I dont really see how shes being disrespectful to me it seemed more to be lexi as she was the one that called people promo thirsty. saying you dont know someone that got promoted is not really that major and anything we can do about because a lot of people can say they dont know someone its not really disrespectful


[19-Apr-21 04:54 PM] stacey#1000
at least to me it isnt


[19-Apr-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
we cant really do anything about it


[19-Apr-21 04:55 PM] stacey#1000
its not a fireable, or even warnable offence for saying "i dont know this person that got promoted"


[19-Apr-21 04:57 PM] cory!#8287
alrighty


[19-Apr-21 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
as for the jaiden one yikes


[19-Apr-21 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
he should get consequences


[19-Apr-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
or at least held back from a promo


[19-Apr-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000

Anywho we will worry about that manager spot at a later date, we don't want to drop too far in heads in the future


[20-Apr-21 04:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank As we have 3 pending manager promotions, you may add up to 3 promotion opinions for heads if there's any you want to promote or someone who stands out. If you don't want to promote feel free to just not join the card!

Greetings Eddie,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've received a formal warning at Bloxton Hotels as of April 26th, 2021 at 12:20 EST. The reasoning behind your formal warning is due to making up excuses on numerous occasions as to why you cannot train a certain rank. As a head, you MUST have a guide for every rank as you can train any rank. If you don‚Äôt have a proper guide, we also have guides provided in the discord so we should never hear any excuses as to why you cannot train a certain rank. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a formal warning in an effort to remind you of your wrongdoings. We ask you to take this formal warning as a reminder and work towards improvement in the future to prevent any further implications. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,
staceyzn
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels

Hes acting like it‚Äôs a major thing and asking why he was warned if according to him it only happened once

Why can‚Äôt he just accept the warning. Can we rank lock him to head for now. He‚Äôs not ready for manager for awhile

[26-Apr-21 01:30 PM] ethan;#0003
i think we should make it so when an mr changes there name or changes there display name they should put it in notices channel


[26-Apr-21 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
we already have it for username changes


[26-Apr-21 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
but not for display name changes


[26-Apr-21 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
as thats not needed


[26-Apr-21 03:11 PM] cory!#8287
can we at least make it a rule that MRs cant change their display names to something dumb like this https://prnt.sc/123sndt

@katie @ethan; hii do you need extensions on your promos


[27-Apr-21 11:29 AM] katie#0200
hi yes pls


[27-Apr-21 04:10 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe im going to try and promote tonight


[27-Apr-21 04:10 PM] ethan;#0003
but if i dont then yes


[27-Apr-21 04:57 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey staff lounge isnt the same as it used to be


[27-Apr-21 04:58 PM] ethan;#0003
whenver i go on its just a spam of people responding to "daily pings" or people calling each other besties


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
I literally dont even talk in staff lounge much if at all tbh


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
cause it usually would just end up getting leaked or i dont really know the mrs now


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who was the head


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] ethan;#0003
same


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
but with people feeling left out Im out of ideas on how to resolve it


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont know any of the mrs anymore


[27-Apr-21 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
noah

[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
if we get rid of "daily ping" out of staff lounge


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
that would resolve part of it


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
Daily pings itself annoy me


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
they are SOOOO STUPID


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
they are POINTLESS


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
like at first it was just in general


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
then somehow it moved to staff lounge


[27-Apr-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
and before it moved to staff lounge, we didnt have this problem


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
because iof the "daily pings" people feel left out because they dont think someone is their friend because they arent in their "daily ping"


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call it a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù we only have MRs that feel like this every once and while


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
what about when people are like tagging so many people being like "happy 17 months!!!"


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
ok thats POINTLESS


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
like


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
they just copy and paste what one person says


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
its not major either though


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
and like its a chain of 10 people


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean I don‚Äôt know what else to do other than just tell them to get involved


[27-Apr-21 05:01 PM] ethan;#0003
who say the same thing


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
the months thing isnt as bad as daily pings


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
but one time i got tagged like 15 times of people saying happy 14 months to me


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
and i was like "wtf idc about this"


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Sometimes you just gotta get yourself involved to not feel ‚Äúleft out‚Äù I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs intentions to leave anyone out in Sl Tbh


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
daily pings is probaly the root of the problem of people feeling left out


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
yeah same


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
i got tagged for like 6 months as gm im like


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
what


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
i didnt even know about this


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
this issue itself is just annoying to me at this point


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
someone complains they feel left out


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
and like


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
idk what to do about it anymore


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
cause we cant force all of them to be bffs either


[27-Apr-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
its hard to get involved anymore in SL


[27-Apr-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
whenever i speak, i just get ignored


[27-Apr-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
i ask a question


[27-Apr-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
nobody responds anymore


[27-Apr-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
its just not the same as it used to be


[27-Apr-21 05:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well sometimes it could just be the chat is going fast and people missed it or something


[27-Apr-21 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
ill go say hi in it rn to see who replies to me


[27-Apr-21 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
people responded to me


[27-Apr-21 05:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Every time I pop into SL it seems as everyone is getting along, I never notice anyone being left out or anything


[27-Apr-21 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[27-Apr-21 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
anyone have any suggestions of what I should tell noah


[27-Apr-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
or is my response good

[27-Apr-21 05:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
noah is getting left out?


[27-Apr-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
yeah and idk what to tell him


[27-Apr-21 05:05 PM] ethan;#0003
a few months ago didnt we think of adding something where you get warned or kicked if you tag a certain amount of people in one message


[27-Apr-21 05:05 PM] cory!#8287
i dont think the exclusion is intentional cuz as bloo said the chat was probably going fast or people were just engaged in a convo


[27-Apr-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
im just annoyed over this thing


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] ethan;#0003
another thing i dont understand


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] ethan;#0003
is why do people say "thank you"


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] ethan;#0003
when they get pinged


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] ethan;#0003
in daily pings


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] cory!#8287
idk i hate daily pings


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
idk if we added anything for that


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
i hate them too


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] cory!#8287
i get like a random daily ping from this random LR ive never talked to before


[27-Apr-21 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
maya started tagging me in "daily bestie pings" and im annoyed over it


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
so then someone else i dont even know adds me to theirs when im not even their friend


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] ethan;#0003
if i get a daily ping from general chat they get blocked


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] ethan;#0003
and everyone knows that


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] ethan;#0003
because ive blocked multiple peopel


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] ethan;#0003
so they know not to add me to a daily ping


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
oh noah replied


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
all he said was thanks I appreciate it


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
but like idk what im supposed to do to resolve it...??


[27-Apr-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
ok then


[27-Apr-21 05:08 PM] ethan;#0003
you should ask him his thoughts on daily pingfs


[27-Apr-21 05:08 PM] ethan;#0003
pings


[27-Apr-21 05:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
well, i dont think u guys should get too worked up about daily pings


[27-Apr-21 05:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I used to get daily pings in general but I think we announced something about it, and then it stopped. I mean me personally I don‚Äôt really mind them I just ignore them and move on lol


[27-Apr-21 05:08 PM] cory!#8287
same i just ignore them


[27-Apr-21 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
thats what I usually do as well


[27-Apr-21 05:09 PM] cory!#8287
idk what you could do about the exclusion tbh, obviously another announcement wont work so


[27-Apr-21 05:10 PM] stacey#1000
yeah im not announcing that again


[27-Apr-21 05:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ask noah why does he think he's being excluded..


[27-Apr-21 05:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
because honestly out of all people..i wouldn't think noah would be excluded


[27-Apr-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
i mean sl is all responding to me rn


[27-Apr-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
they dont seem to exclude people


[27-Apr-21 05:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
There's no way they'd ignore an hr lol


[27-Apr-21 05:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
Exclusion is a problem but we can't rlly do anything about it


[27-Apr-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
noah says its the same people ignoring him


[27-Apr-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
so im just asking him who


[27-Apr-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
nvm he wont even tell me who it is


[27-Apr-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
oh well

Just ask them to remove you


[27-Apr-21 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
^


[27-Apr-21 05:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
If they refuse to remove you from daily pings then u can warn them


[27-Apr-21 05:32 PM] ethan;#0003
thats a troll they are just tagging every online mr+


[27-Apr-21 05:32 PM] ethan;#0003
people who do that are probs alts


[27-Apr-21 05:34 PM] cory!#8287

[27-Apr-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

@Bloo_Berriez Archive liviiqz's card? She can be re-added if she comes back active and you can have the next manager promotion if you'd like.


[28-Apr-21 10:22 AM] bonnie591#0591
We'll do another manager vote in a week or so. I'll wait for the current promotions to be done first

[28-Apr-21 02:34 PM] cory!#8287
its def a current manager cuz all of that was said before those 4 managers resigned


[28-Apr-21 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
we should probably get them to stop discussing promos there and make promotion suggestions private but then they will have the satisfaction of getting it changed


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
hmm


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
admircbIe is a really good worker


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
but


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
they got lr on their first day of roblox


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
and has quit a few times


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
recent time they become lr was 23rd march


[28-Apr-21 03:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
so they are more than a month

speech for best artist award thing


[28-Apr-21 03:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
they seem genuine. i doubt they are an alt of a violent troller but they are probs either an alt to avoid safechat or maybe even a former cb whos gone nice


[28-Apr-21 03:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
thoughts? @High Rank


[28-Apr-21 03:13 PM] cory!#8287
they seem pretty sweet and have a good personality so i wouldnt mind them


[28-Apr-21 03:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
yea


[28-Apr-21 03:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could just give them a chance and just be careful when it comes to them potentially becoming a management


[28-Apr-21 03:14 PM] cory!#8287
mhm


[28-Apr-21 03:15 PM] cory!#8287
also for the leaking stuff, im sus of dovellia cuz i think she was fired before for leaking, matt because he has a close relationship with cbs and trollers, and sophia cuz she leaked as a manager before and is like best friends with every single toxic person


[28-Apr-21 03:15 PM] cory!#8287
mainly sophia


[28-Apr-21 03:16 PM] cory!#8287
like every single appeal she has sent in was from a toxic person trying to appeal


[28-Apr-21 03:18 PM] bonnie591#0591

[28-Apr-21 08:13 PM] cory!#8287
heres more


[28-Apr-21 08:13 PM] cory!#8287
i personally think is sophia cuz she already leaked as a manager


[28-Apr-21 08:13 PM] cory!#8287
but


[28-Apr-21 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
there hasnt been a new manager in a month


[28-Apr-21 08:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmmm, are we sure it‚Äôs none of the managers who resigned? when we had those wave of managers resign, that was on 4/20-4/21 and most of these messages are from 4/18-4/19


[28-Apr-21 08:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean I haven‚Äôt seen anything newer than that


[28-Apr-21 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
when did it happen


[28-Apr-21 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
today?


[28-Apr-21 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003
what was posted in announcements


[28-Apr-21 08:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wdym what happened today, the troller at the hotel leaking messages?


[28-Apr-21 08:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
theres been like a leaker since the mass shift or whatever


[28-Apr-21 08:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
they could be two diff people or the same people


[28-Apr-21 08:21 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Let me look at one of the messages


[28-Apr-21 08:22 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez what day where the leaked messages sent? did u say


[28-Apr-21 08:22 PM] ethan;#0003
the day whey where said in manager lounge


[28-Apr-21 08:22 PM] ethan;#0003
was it saturday?


[28-Apr-21 08:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Has there been anything that‚Äôs been leaked from the lounge that‚Äôs dated like this week or something? cause like I said a lot of the messages that were leaked were from 4/18-4/19.


[28-Apr-21 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
3 managers have resigned since the 17th


[28-Apr-21 08:24 PM] ethan;#0003
or 3 have resigned that put it in the channel

[28-Apr-21 08:27 PM] cory!#8287
its none of them


[28-Apr-21 08:27 PM] cory!#8287
cuz they were talking about recent promo suggestions


[28-Apr-21 08:27 PM] ethan;#0003
i found a suspect possibly


[28-Apr-21 08:27 PM] cory!#8287
that were sent after they resigned

[28-Apr-21 08:28 PM] ethan;#0003
i think this might be an alt


[28-Apr-21 08:30 PM] KjRBLX#2053
they've been management all this time..why start now? or why start leaking into the out and open?


[28-Apr-21 08:34 PM] courtney#5125
aurora's been an mr at boba before tho


[28-Apr-21 08:34 PM] courtney#5125
i doubt an alt intended for bloxton would make the effort to become an mr at other groups too


[28-Apr-21 09:09 PM] ethan;#0003

[28-Apr-21 09:52 PM] stacey#1000
It can‚Äôt be jess7ca. She‚Äôs a former senior and I doubt she would leak


[28-Apr-21 09:56 PM] lyss#0709
i don't think imogen would have done it either


[28-Apr-21 11:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how do you know it‚Äôs someone from BST? @ethan;


[29-Apr-21 06:36 AM] ethan;#0003
The messages they leaked showed the time


[29-Apr-21 06:37 AM] ethan;#0003
They copy and pasted the time


[29-Apr-21 09:18 AM] stacey#1000
They could‚Äôve easily changed the time to try and throw us off too


[29-Apr-21 09:18 AM] stacey#1000
So it could be anyone


[29-Apr-21 09:39 AM] ethan;#0003
Doubt they are that smart


[29-Apr-21 10:13 AM] bonnie591#0591
its probably a bst but we 100% cant rule out the other timezones


[29-Apr-21 10:34 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn please don‚Äôt make movie night a thing again I‚Äôm never hosting one again. Exploiters just joined and made everything lag out from the chat so I won‚Äôt be doing that again.


[29-Apr-21 10:35 AM] stacey#1000
So for may madness this year no movie night


[29-Apr-21 11:07 AM] xM_inn#2821
fair, what about an mr-only movie night though?


[29-Apr-21 11:12 AM] stacey#1000
If there is a leaker I don‚Äôt feel comfortable hosting one


[29-Apr-21 11:12 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn


[29-Apr-21 11:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
yea


[29-Apr-21 11:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
agreed with stacey


[29-Apr-21 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
Last time I hosted an MR only movie night and posted in staff announcements it got leaked and I got Dm complaints asking why I give people special treatment and host movie nights for MRs. After that I‚Äôve never hosted a movie night again unless it was for like my group of friends.


[29-Apr-21 11:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
bruhh


[29-Apr-21 11:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah no movie night pls


[29-Apr-21 12:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
i was kinda suspicious about modern ngl


[29-Apr-21 12:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
id say suspend and investigate both. do a vote first tho @cory!


[29-Apr-21 12:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn oi u!


[29-Apr-21 12:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
suspend and investigate matti first


[29-Apr-21 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
leave modern unsuspended for now


[29-Apr-21 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
if the leaking continues while matti is suspended, we know its not him


[29-Apr-21 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
if it stops, thats definitely a red flag


[29-Apr-21 12:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
modern is encouraging trool to bypass ban right


[29-Apr-21 12:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
so that should probs get a punishment too


[29-Apr-21 12:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
yikes..


[29-Apr-21 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
I would say so


[29-Apr-21 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
but I think we should investigate them 1 at a time


[29-Apr-21 12:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
As we can observe the status of the leaking while gathering more information from both of the people suspected


[29-Apr-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
YA


[29-Apr-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
yaa*


[29-Apr-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
true


[29-Apr-21 01:00 PM] cory!#8287
okay I‚Äôll do a vote


[29-Apr-21 01:09 PM] ethan;#0003
@cory! they where both on the list of BST managers


[29-Apr-21 01:14 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn @bonnie591 @cory! last night I got the list of all BST managers and compared it to the mrs who marked that they where going to the mass shift and MordernWrld and Matt both did not mark yes


[29-Apr-21 01:14 PM] ethan;#0003
There was 4 or 5 BST managers who didn‚Äôt mark yes


[29-Apr-21 01:15 PM] ethan;#0003
And ModernWrld and Matt where two of them


[29-Apr-21 01:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah its probs them


[29-Apr-21 01:16 PM] ethan;#0003
When I get home I‚Äôll search for info


[29-Apr-21 01:16 PM] ethan;#0003
Istg one is probs Aidan


[29-Apr-21 01:25 PM] cory!#8287
yeah that‚Äôs sus


[29-Apr-21 01:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And Matti has trool in his bio. must be that close if he puts his name in his bio

[29-Apr-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
it also seems like the Nojjyrue discord account he deleted it or changed the tag after he left the discord on 4/25/2021


[29-Apr-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
because i cant tag the user ID


[29-Apr-21 02:07 PM] ethan;#0003
just the fact that his alt account that was demoted in june left the discord on the day there was leakers is VERY suspicious


[29-Apr-21 02:08 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591


[29-Apr-21 02:17 PM] cory!#8287
damn, after seeing that he‚Äôs prob the leaker


[29-Apr-21 02:17 PM] cory!#8287
and modern maybe


[29-Apr-21 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yea that's concerning


[29-Apr-21 02:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Get matt suspended pending investigation


[29-Apr-21 02:28 PM] ethan;#0003
@cory! the only evidence of mordernworld doing anything wrong is him responding to trool with a vpn name


[29-Apr-21 02:29 PM] cory!#8287
yeah but hes also close with trool so he could have leaked something as well


[29-Apr-21 02:29 PM] cory!#8287
but yeah i agree with suspending matt


[29-Apr-21 02:29 PM] ethan;#0003
thats not enough evidence to investigate someone off of


[29-Apr-21 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
if they ask for proof or something


[29-Apr-21 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
we have none


[29-Apr-21 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
other then they are friends


[29-Apr-21 02:30 PM] cory!#8287
yeah true


[29-Apr-21 02:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah honestly with the pictures Ethan sent up there, most likely Matti the one leaking. Now we just need to question and see what we get out of him or like a confirmation.


[29-Apr-21 02:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
are you gonna suspend cory?


[29-Apr-21 02:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Once we are done dealing with matt, modern should definitely get a warning and possibly a rank lock for encouraging someone to bypass their ban


[29-Apr-21 02:36 PM] cory!#8287
sure i can suspend


[29-Apr-21 02:36 PM] cory!#8287
does someone wanna question them with me?


[29-Apr-21 02:37 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[29-Apr-21 02:37 PM] ethan;#0003
me


[29-Apr-21 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ask minn if he wants to as well cuz he's like super scary to people


[29-Apr-21 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
And very good at it


[29-Apr-21 02:38 PM] cory!#8287
@xM_inn u wanna help investigate?


[29-Apr-21 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
I remember when I was good at investigations


[29-Apr-21 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Not anymore


[29-Apr-21 02:38 PM] cory!#8287
ok ethan


[29-Apr-21 02:39 PM] ethan;#0003
the best investigation ive ever done was the one with claire/cece


[29-Apr-21 02:39 PM] ethan;#0003
resulted in 4 almost 5 mrs getting fired


[29-Apr-21 02:39 PM] ethan;#0003
i removed him from the manager board @cory!


[29-Apr-21 02:40 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[29-Apr-21 02:40 PM] cory!#8287
i was just checking to see if he was at any sessions before i suspended


[29-Apr-21 02:42 PM] ethan;#0003
@cory! is he ranked suspended yet


[29-Apr-21 02:43 PM] cory!#8287
yup just did it


[29-Apr-21 02:46 PM] cory!#8287
hes offline atm so ill let u know when he responds to my message


[29-Apr-21 02:46 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Apr-21 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821

[29-Apr-21 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821

[29-Apr-21 03:32 PM] ethan;#0003

That type of question isn't appropriate for staff lounge

He seemed to say it with innocence though so idk

@ethan; @cory! Um, did you have him search any of these words before you just asked him to search the word leak? https://gyazo.com/e03c5aa71cceff33d3e1ff1477c86903

no

Because if not, that means he's been searching leak, leaking and TOS before..

[29-Apr-21 05:21 PM] cory!#8287
or one of those channels


[29-Apr-21 05:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
I've been recording the entire thing so I'll check


[29-Apr-21 05:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
One moment


[29-Apr-21 05:23 PM] cory!#8287

[29-Apr-21 05:23 PM] cory!#8287

Isn't Pansy an MR??


[29-Apr-21 05:24 PM] cory!#8287
the management color in that channel


[29-Apr-21 05:24 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[29-Apr-21 05:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
Is that the same Pansy who's an MR


[29-Apr-21 05:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
Because if so she's just admitted to bypassing on an ALT..

PANSY#4444

[29-Apr-21 05:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
Same person


[29-Apr-21 05:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
During the period of time in which that screenshot took place (April 15th around then), her tag was that


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
While we don't have her tag, the name it identical


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
So I guess we have another MR to investigate for violation of Roblox TOS + Hotel Guidelines on an ALT


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003
She could be joking, seems like she said it in a joking manner


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
She *could*


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
But considering who she's associating with


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] ethan;#0003
ill ask who zam is


[29-Apr-21 05:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
She also could've been fr on an ALT


[29-Apr-21 05:29 PM] cory!#8287

are beyond questionable at this point


[29-Apr-21 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
They're too blurry to see from my recording so I just copied the link of one of them and wow ok

[29-Apr-21 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
Hmm


[29-Apr-21 05:35 PM] ethan;#0003
Did his phone die


[29-Apr-21 05:35 PM] ethan;#0003
again


[29-Apr-21 05:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
His phone seems to die at interesting moments


[29-Apr-21 05:36 PM] cory!#8287
he said he crashed but is still in the vc


[29-Apr-21 05:36 PM] cory!#8287
unless he meant the screen sharing


[29-Apr-21 05:37 PM] ethan;#0003
You can tell, the stream freezes


[29-Apr-21 05:37 PM] ethan;#0003
That he crashed or something


[29-Apr-21 05:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If his phone keeps dying he's probably doing it on purpose. why not just charge it instead of letting it die


[29-Apr-21 05:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
he is very suspicious


[29-Apr-21 05:39 PM] ethan;#0003
his phone is legit at 0% LOL


[29-Apr-21 05:40 PM] ethan;#0003
I can believe what he is saying some of it.


[29-Apr-21 05:40 PM] ethan;#0003
Like if he knew that there was a leaker


[29-Apr-21 05:40 PM] ethan;#0003
He wouldnt ask for information about it


[29-Apr-21 05:40 PM] ethan;#0003
He would just go into info or names


[29-Apr-21 05:40 PM] ethan;#0003
But he asked what happend


[29-Apr-21 05:41 PM] ethan;#0003
Becauase he truely did not know

kylie


[29-Apr-21 05:49 PM] ethan;#0003
she probs leaked it


[29-Apr-21 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
It looks like the email you get sent when someone adds you to a Trello board


[29-Apr-21 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
so it could be a current or old management for all we know


[29-Apr-21 05:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah


[29-Apr-21 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
Either way, as long as they didn't leak the contents I'm not too concerned about that


[29-Apr-21 05:49 PM] xM_inn#2821
definitely interesting though :/

talked to little about matt and this is what I got (screenshots of the highlights). I think we should just be weary about him considering he was really suspicious during that investigation in my opinion

Worked well, only thing is there's no button to dismiss all hands, but i could just turn off hand raises and clear them all out


[30-Apr-21 05:22 PM] cory!#8287
why was he being so disrespectful tf


[30-Apr-21 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can't rlly control their behaviour in gcs but like modern did also encourage someone to bypass their ban so


[30-Apr-21 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think we should probs suspend to try and fix his behavior


[30-Apr-21 05:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll wait for more thoughts and do a vote tomorrow


[30-Apr-21 06:15 PM] cory!#8287
i agree


[30-Apr-21 07:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah i def think he needs a suspension for encouraging someone to bypass their ban. the group chat, i mean we can't really do much since it's not really bloxton related but def know he won't be getting a promo. should probs be rank locked
