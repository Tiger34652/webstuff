I see you fake offline stalking general


[01-Feb-21 12:20 AM] stacey#1000
Come to this one for a min


[01-Feb-21 12:20 AM] lyss#0709
ah yes


[01-Feb-21 12:20 AM] lyss#0709

[01-Feb-21 12:21 AM] stacey#1000
So people were talking about builder right


[01-Feb-21 12:21 AM] lyss#0709
rightt


[01-Feb-21 12:21 AM] stacey#1000
And wanting to report him for apparently being a homophobe and say the hr team will ignore it and won’t do anything


[01-Feb-21 12:21 AM] stacey#1000
Well look what evidence they trying to use

This is from July. When he was a head


[01-Feb-21 12:22 AM] stacey#1000
Some former MR leaked


[01-Feb-21 12:22 AM] stacey#1000
Legit people expect us to be able to do stuff with old evidence.......


[01-Feb-21 12:22 AM] lyss#0709
oh my


[01-Feb-21 12:23 AM] lyss#0709
yeah what could we possibly do about it now


[01-Feb-21 12:23 AM] lyss#0709
plus he literally put it in quotes, which, not to say it justifies using the word, he clearly wasnt saying it TO someone


[01-Feb-21 12:23 AM] lyss#0709
so like


[01-Feb-21 12:23 AM] lyss#0709
idk why theyre THAT mad about it


[01-Feb-21 12:23 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I’m talking to Alex too


[01-Feb-21 12:24 AM] stacey#1000
She told me about it


[01-Feb-21 12:24 AM] stacey#1000
And what they were trying to report


[01-Feb-21 12:25 AM] stacey#1000
So I told her I would tell you about it too


[01-Feb-21 12:25 AM] lyss#0709
if he was actually saying it to someone with the intentions of being malicious, yeah thats a problem, but 1. it was many many months ago 2. he couldve easily not understood the severity of the word and 3. he wasnt even directing it to someone, he was just quoting it


[01-Feb-21 12:28 AM] stacey#1000
If you get a report of it just ignore it


[01-Feb-21 12:28 AM] stacey#1000
Idk how they expect us to be able to do anything about it


[01-Feb-21 12:28 AM] lyss#0709
okay


[01-Feb-21 12:29 AM] lyss#0709
and yeah theyre blowing it way out of proportion, it does not seem at all like he was trying to be homophobic or offensive towards anyone on purpose


[01-Feb-21 12:30 AM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[01-Feb-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
I feel bad for builder. He’s getting so much hate


[01-Feb-21 12:34 AM] lyss#0709
yeahh me too tbh


[01-Feb-21 12:34 AM] stacey#1000
Everyone causing drama over in in gd rn gets warned and if they continue kicked


[01-Feb-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709
oh story just dmed me about it now


[01-Feb-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709
interesting


[01-Feb-21 12:35 AM] lyss#0709

Tell her it happened months ago and he was a head as well. Tell her he also did change it and he didn’t direct it at anyone. We cannot take action against someone from months ago.


[01-Feb-21 12:37 AM] stacey#1000
What do people expect us to do? We cannot fire or terminate for that....


[01-Feb-21 12:37 AM] stacey#1000
Like fr


[01-Feb-21 12:38 AM] stacey#1000
Well


[01-Feb-21 12:38 AM] stacey#1000
Just say it was months ago and we can’t do stuff if it was months ago like that I guess


[01-Feb-21 12:38 AM] lyss#0709
okay, thank u!


[01-Feb-21 03:20 AM] lyss#0709
oh i forgot to mention this but fa9ke did :info all at the hotel the other day -- idk how important it is or if it even matters but figured id just bring it up

are mrs allowed to be in gcs with cbs that trash-talk the group


[01-Feb-21 10:16 AM] cory!#8287
id assume not but just asking


[01-Feb-21 11:17 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I messed up one day


[01-Feb-21 11:17 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I did the /e


[01-Feb-21 11:17 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But i put a space before


[01-Feb-21 11:18 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And it put it out to public


[01-Feb-21 11:18 AM] lyss#0709
hey what are ur guys' thoughts on letting tango (iiitango/tangottr) have a chance to appeal? my friend has told me that she'd like to


[01-Feb-21 11:18 AM] lyss#0709
her blacklist ^


[01-Feb-21 11:19 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I was so scared, nobody attempted to do the command


[01-Feb-21 11:26 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yikes i had a feeling she was involved


[01-Feb-21 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
and this is why ive said krysal cant get promoted in the past


[01-Feb-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
kystal was involved with cbs and is not involved with the best people and doesnt have great maturity to get promoted


[01-Feb-21 11:34 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Lets see, out of all the people i promoted in January - i think only tr2vl is the last one


[01-Feb-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
@cory! is that server a trash talk server an alt acc could get in to spy on


[01-Feb-21 11:37 AM] cory!#8287
yeah


[01-Feb-21 11:37 AM] cory!#8287
but I wouldn’t join yet since they just made it


[01-Feb-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
do u want to join it on an alt acc with me


[01-Feb-21 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
and we can pretend to be friends on the alt accs to not look sus


[01-Feb-21 11:38 AM] cory!#8287
sure


[01-Feb-21 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
we dont need to join it rn though


[01-Feb-21 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
maybe in a couple days


[01-Feb-21 11:38 AM] cory!#8287
yeah cause it’s probably only them 6 in it rn


[01-Feb-21 11:39 AM] KjRBLX#2053
If you get a invite link, keep posting it in a certain place and it will show how many is in it


[01-Feb-21 11:39 AM] KjRBLX#2053
So u can decide when its a good time to join


[01-Feb-21 11:39 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Prob can get the invite link in the picture and test it out


[01-Feb-21 11:39 AM] cory!#8287
mansion is an admin in the server so he said he will give us invites if they expire


[01-Feb-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
i want to spy on an alt


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
tell me when i can join it


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
and send me invite when i can


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] cory!#8287
okay


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] cory!#8287
I told him to tell me when they start inviting people


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
spying on an alt in the cb server helped us get rid of 2-3 MRs that were toxic


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
it was great


[01-Feb-21 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
so ill do it again


[01-Feb-21 11:42 AM] cory!#8287
I’m pretty sure the luvariela person made the server


[01-Feb-21 11:42 AM] lyss#0709
^


[01-Feb-21 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
Idk


[01-Feb-21 11:44 AM] lyss#0709
weLL her blacklist card says no appeals permitted so i just wanted possible opinions on if she should be


[01-Feb-21 11:44 AM] lyss#0709
given the chance


[01-Feb-21 11:45 AM] lyss#0709
considering she was blacklisted almost 10 months ago


[01-Feb-21 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
If it says no appeals I wouldn’t


[01-Feb-21 12:02 PM] stacey#1000
Idk what she was blacklisted for


[01-Feb-21 12:41 PM] lyss#0709
okayy i can tell her no then


[01-Feb-21 12:42 PM] lyss#0709
i dont remember the exact reason but i think it was just for trolling and bypassing a lot @stacey


[01-Feb-21 02:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
guys do we let MRs spectate at interviews, is that a new thing i dont know about


[01-Feb-21 02:37 PM] lyss#0709
umMm i wouldn't think so


[01-Feb-21 02:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok cause 2 mrs asked me about it and i was like "uhmmm, noo?"


[01-Feb-21 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez if they are a new mr and have never done interviews yes


[01-Feb-21 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
you should


[01-Feb-21 02:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well yeah i said new mrs but they werent new mrs


[01-Feb-21 03:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i understand a new mr asking


[01-Feb-21 05:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@High Rank If anyone wants to take 2ky_le, the person I was gonna promo, go for it. It’s been kinda hard for me to get around promoting him so if anyone wants to take him, I can extend the due date by a couple days for you!


[01-Feb-21 05:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ummm nah


[01-Feb-21 05:48 PM] cory!#8287
I haven’t seen him at all since that card was made for him


[01-Feb-21 05:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah he’s kinda been off and on. He went to a session couple days ago, and then there was a huge gap where he wasn’t going so idk! if no one wants him we can re-evaluate his activity and then maybe bring him back around. I just personally haven’t seen him but if anyone wants him just lmk.


[01-Feb-21 06:04 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX join me at trainings


[01-Feb-21 06:05 PM] cory!#8287

[01-Feb-21 06:13 PM] cory!#8287
if we did suspend her again shes just gonna act worse 🤷‍♂️


[01-Feb-21 06:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@xM_inn You gotta get mamajo to rejoin. I did :fly m instead of :fly me because i panicked when u dropped all of us off the platform


[01-Feb-21 06:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
idk if the server is slocked or not


[01-Feb-21 06:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
nvm he crashed anyway

[03-Feb-21 01:33 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 01:33 PM] lyss#0709

vickyglow is the person who was leaking to kylie correct?


[03-Feb-21 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
cus she is matching usernames with her it says in her bio


[03-Feb-21 02:01 PM] lyss#0709
yeah


[03-Feb-21 02:01 PM] lyss#0709
i believe so


[03-Feb-21 02:02 PM] lyss#0709
right yeah bc thats why she was fired


[03-Feb-21 02:03 PM] lyss#0709
i wouldnt really be surprised if little did something since vicky was terminated, and then both vicky and little have matching users with victorsglow, who is allegedly a cb or blacklisted user

its possible it could be annazzy and this account was used to upload decals when she worked here


[03-Feb-21 02:12 PM] ethan;#0003

[03-Feb-21 02:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oop, interesting


[03-Feb-21 02:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Feb-21 02:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
she said someone was ranting to her?


[03-Feb-21 02:42 PM] lyss#0709
yeah apparently, she said id know who it was but i have no clue


[03-Feb-21 02:54 PM] lyss#0709
now shes just ignoring me


[03-Feb-21 02:55 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 02:55 PM] ethan;#0003

Nvm


[03-Feb-21 05:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They used to be i think


[03-Feb-21 05:24 PM] cory!#8287
I’m surprised y’all wanna terminate her


[03-Feb-21 05:24 PM] cory!#8287
I was thinking just a warning or suspension


[03-Feb-21 05:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
She should know not to accept bribes


[03-Feb-21 05:26 PM] cory!#8287
true


[03-Feb-21 05:28 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 can we terminate her?


[03-Feb-21 05:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Denied, not termination worthy


[03-Feb-21 05:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Or at least with the evidence you have


[03-Feb-21 05:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Go with suspension if you want though


[03-Feb-21 05:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
@cory!


[03-Feb-21 05:30 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[03-Feb-21 05:35 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 3 day suspension ok?


[03-Feb-21 05:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ye


[03-Feb-21 05:35 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[03-Feb-21 05:39 PM] cory!#8287
im gonna wait until shes done with training to suspend


[03-Feb-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
yeah termination is way too strict


[03-Feb-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
I was about to say


[03-Feb-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
we cant fire for the minor things


[03-Feb-21 05:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
^


[03-Feb-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
like all i see is she is saying "ill promo suggest you if you give me this"


[03-Feb-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
tbh I would even say a warning over a suspension


[03-Feb-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
cause like how is that major


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah tbh


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Like


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh they promo suggested to 5 hrs


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
they never suggested to me


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
but like promo suggesting people is not even major-


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
What's that actually gonna do they don't have access to promo suggestion channel, if a head dmed me a promo suggestion I'd just tell them I don't accept them


[03-Feb-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
like not everyone that gets suggested gets promoted


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Shall we just do a warning


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
so like what exactly are we suspending for....???


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
legit this is so confusing


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
and minor


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! @stacey


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
yall are confusing me on why you want a termination or suspension


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
I vote formal warning


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
do a formal warning


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
Pls pls dont be so strict for the smallest things guys


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
this is not even a rule


[03-Feb-21 05:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ye like ur basically saying that's as bad as leaking!


[03-Feb-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
like no rule was violated


[03-Feb-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
there is


[03-Feb-21 05:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thing is what if its a joke


[03-Feb-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
no rule against promotion suggesting people


[03-Feb-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
just do a warning for bribing people to promotion suggest them


[03-Feb-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX @Tattoblue @courtney @ethan; tagging because you all voted for terminate


[03-Feb-21 05:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Dw about it but if the termination did go ahead and the founders saw I don't think they'd be too impressed


[03-Feb-21 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
its good we need BOD approval and do team votes


[03-Feb-21 05:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yuh. I remember when we could just promote people to head without any vote or anything, I mean nothing went wrong with it but better to have agreements


[03-Feb-21 05:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
uh hold up


[03-Feb-21 05:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
wait a second


[03-Feb-21 05:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
Omg- I don't think I've seen a senior vote with this much variety


[03-Feb-21 05:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[03-Feb-21 05:51 PM] cory!#8287
she wanted to leak hr channels of his group


[03-Feb-21 05:51 PM] lyss#0709
well threatening to leak and actually leaking arent the same thing


[03-Feb-21 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
if there is actually evidence of her leaking then yeah but that doesnt show her leaking stuff


[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] lyss#0709
i think we should just hire them all 😁


[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Do u


[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] stacey#1000
ya there is too many good candidates


[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] lyss#0709
they can all fight to the death to host servers :)


[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] cory!#8287

[03-Feb-21 05:52 PM] lyss#0709

thats crazy


[03-Feb-21 05:53 PM] lyss#0709
or we should at least hire three!! 😁😁


[03-Feb-21 05:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i dont think ive ever seen this before


[03-Feb-21 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
no 2 new seniors is good


[03-Feb-21 05:54 PM] stacey#1000
i might change my vote but for now thats who i vote


[03-Feb-21 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well lyss, we can! However we will be 3 people over the rank limit! Don't worry though, I have a simple solution to this. We will fire imag, hire two current seniors as a shift. Unfortunately I don't want the inconvenience of too many hrs so I will host some wonderful reforms where we demote you to management!


[03-Feb-21 05:54 PM] lyss#0709
yeah just demote me


[03-Feb-21 05:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh good u agree!


[03-Feb-21 05:54 PM] lyss#0709
yeah! then all of the candidates can get senior :) self sacrifice = worth it


[03-Feb-21 05:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ahh idk who else to vote for


[03-Feb-21 05:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

idrk about them, theyre active but theyre kinda mean


[03-Feb-21 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Frappe hr or something


[03-Feb-21 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Alright person tho


[03-Feb-21 05:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
BUT I have a better idea


[03-Feb-21 06:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Change all the head ranks to "Supervisors", then create a new rank between management and senior and then just rename management, the new rank and senior. Then allow the new rank to host second servers and allow the senior people to ban and like idk hr intern


[03-Feb-21 06:01 PM] lyss#0709
that


[03-Feb-21 06:01 PM] lyss#0709
sounds


[03-Feb-21 06:01 PM] lyss#0709
um..!


[03-Feb-21 06:01 PM] lyss#0709
interesting..!


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ikr


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
ACTUALLY I GOT AN EVEN BETTER IDEA


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] lyss#0709
we should just COMPLETELY forget about the rank limit!!


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
We will copy-


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
That would be a disaster


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] lyss#0709
extend it by 3 !!! :D


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] KjRBLX#2053
me trying to figure out what ur trying to say :what:


[03-Feb-21 06:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
We will copy divine sister and rename the hr ranks to imperial ranks. @Bloo_Berriez WE ARE GONNA BE AN IMPERIAL MONARCH


[03-Feb-21 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOL kj


[03-Feb-21 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
A rank limit of 28? How ugly!


[03-Feb-21 06:03 PM] lyss#0709
idk man im giving u GREAT ideas here


[03-Feb-21 06:03 PM] lyss#0709
itd be worth it!! :D


[03-Feb-21 06:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Reminder to never give lyss bod otherwise we will have 50 seniors and 2 managements

hey im just trying to help u out here!!!! 😁


[03-Feb-21 06:04 PM] cory!#8287
cant even imagine 50 seniors


[03-Feb-21 06:04 PM] lyss#0709
i think i have great ideas


[03-Feb-21 06:04 PM] lyss#0709
thatd be so fun


[03-Feb-21 06:04 PM] cory!#8287
"Sure, 25th server!"


[03-Feb-21 06:04 PM] lyss#0709
we would need 2 million group members


[03-Feb-21 06:04 PM] lyss#0709
for that to even work


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
hmmmmmmmmmm


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
well


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
with the math


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
1 m group gets us like 5 servers maybe


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] lyss#0709
hey woah im just a pixel hotel hr not a math genius


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Or just stop lrs helping at sessions so trainees are all in one or two servers! Or we could make our app system automated and make it super easy like Sizzle burger!


[03-Feb-21 06:05 PM] lyss#0709
yeah!


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
We got 2 servers at 100k


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
So


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
3 probs


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Kj ur an old hr


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Get robots to do the helping and training


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
What did u get


[03-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
How about we make a gamepass for 3333 robux


[03-Feb-21 06:07 PM] lyss#0709
i think "Buy Shift Manager" for about 16 robux will do wonders


[03-Feb-21 06:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
-proceeds to move Shift Manager under heads rank-


[03-Feb-21 06:08 PM] lyss#0709
well bonnie youve got just so many amazing options to choose from! 😁


[03-Feb-21 06:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
it would take about 5m group to get 25 servers


[03-Feb-21 06:09 PM] lyss#0709
well....surely we'll get there!


[03-Feb-21 06:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
bloxton hotels training server holds


[03-Feb-21 06:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
50 folks


[03-Feb-21 06:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
50*25


[03-Feb-21 06:10 PM] lyss#0709
we could just make the servers smaller!


[03-Feb-21 06:10 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Feb-21 06:10 PM] lyss#0709

i feel like alex is similar to megan in the sense that she doesnt do anything for months, but comes back rarely to do some sessions and shifts


[03-Feb-21 06:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
The thing is


[03-Feb-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
she was only inactive for a period of time for personal family reasons


[03-Feb-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
but shes been back since like


[03-Feb-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Feb-21 06:25 PM] cory!#8287

[03-Feb-21 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh dear


[03-Feb-21 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
I legit always forget to do it


[03-Feb-21 06:26 PM] stacey#1000

Top middle there's like all the members


[03-Feb-21 06:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’m sorry but Alex is not ready for senior right now.


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Go to the +80 or whatever


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
im not saying yall have to vote her


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Find her


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Her activity is not consistent


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
Click her


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ur phone things the userids are phone numbers?


[03-Feb-21 06:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
call and see if a_ves will pick up


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
ok so looking at it


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
she did nothing in december for holidays im guessing


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
then is active again in jan


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] cory!#8287
i hope tati remains active after this vote cause i rlly want her to be a senior one day


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Her reports for January have been okay, November nothing much. October, was pretty decent and then August was decent. She’s very here and there.


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
let me do a gif thing


[03-Feb-21 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah but Stacey im kinda curious to why u vote her but not other active seniors. She's been on the team for a long time but fails to actually meet our management requirements according to attendance logs. You say that she goes to ur sessions but if she went to ur sessions twice a week then that would just be completing the minimum and arguably host biased.


[03-Feb-21 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
shes been a manager since 2019


[03-Feb-21 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
if she was very inactive she wouldve been fired


[03-Feb-21 06:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Shes not very inactive, but she isn't very active


[03-Feb-21 06:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
She’s not inactive to the point where she’s gonna get fired though. She’s not consistent that’s the thing


[03-Feb-21 06:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
Either active or just an acceptable standard


[03-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
shes not the most active but she is still doing stuff is my point


[03-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
like sure she doesnt like


[03-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
do a lot of sessions everyday


[03-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
and thats her choice but she is still doing stuff and has been a manager for so long I dont see why she doesnt deserve a chance thats just my opinion


[03-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
she is still doing stuff when she can


[03-Feb-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
idc if she doesnt win the vote


[03-Feb-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
im just voting for her because its my opinion on it


[03-Feb-21 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
same reason i voted for vac


[03-Feb-21 06:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
I get that but we can only hire 2 seniors usually per vote and we have a rank limit, if she is only attending ur sessions and isn't that active then how do we expect her to complete her checklist and help out with our servers at other hr sessions. I mean yeah ur entitled to ur own opinion and ur entitled to vote whoever u want but just pointing out hiring her wouldn't really be the best option


[03-Feb-21 06:32 PM] lyss#0709
i feel like the only thing shes got over any of the other managers is how long shes been a manager


[03-Feb-21 06:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
^


[03-Feb-21 06:33 PM] lyss#0709
but every other candidate on the list beats her in terms of activity, so itd be unfair to take the spot away from them just so she could be an inactive senior


[03-Feb-21 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
I mean you do make good points


[03-Feb-21 06:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And not gonna lie, it’s like what Lyss said if she were to become a Senior, I personally feel like her activity wouldn’t be the best cause her management activity is like she’s active here for a couple days and then she’s inactive. Idk, just curious as to why you voted for her but it’s a Senior vote so I guess we all see different things.


[03-Feb-21 06:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
Also I find it amusing how every vote roxie / Emma gets the "I'll vote next time or just in the future". If she's been nominated this many times and is pretty new then she must be good, but when are we all gonna vote for her? I get others are like more experienced but EH


[03-Feb-21 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
I also legit have no other clue who else to vote for


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
so even if i changed my vote idk who I would vote


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
I mean it is a tricky vote


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Never seen such a variety


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] lyss#0709
ill probably vote for emma next time


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
I know I for sure want vac


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] stacey#1000
I wanted vac last vote


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes but will u


[03-Feb-21 06:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Cuz we can say that and then next time u won't


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] lyss#0709
thing is, each time, the managers from the previous vote always start winning the next vote


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] lyss#0709
so its


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] lyss#0709
difficult


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean I’m pretty firm with mendo. He’s active, and deserved it honestly


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but idk who to give my 2nd vote FR


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
for*


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] lyss#0709
i really want mendo for sure


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I mean addies here and there. I see her sometimes at my sessions but I’d say give her more time


[03-Feb-21 06:36 PM] lyss#0709
and i also do want jackson bc hes sooooo active for the aedt timezone


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
What’s AEDT


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
where is that at


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm iffy on mendo but if u all want him then sure, I will have more to say if he's ever nominated for shift though!


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] lyss#0709
hes just like willow


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Has Courtney voted on this senior vote yet


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
ill probably change my vote from alex to someone else or just unvote and not for


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
cause idk who else to vote for


[03-Feb-21 06:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
What’s up with mendo @bonnie591 like what’s holding you back


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
yall make valid points on alex


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
i dont want to vote mendo


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
but if u guys do its fine


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] lyss#0709
yeah im confused whats wrong with mendo


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
is there something that happened that I don’t know happened


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
same


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don’t think we’ve ever got major reports on him have we


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] lyss#0709
hes literally the best person to vc with like hes got a great personality yk


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] lyss#0709
and hes very active


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] lyss#0709
and professional in-game


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
what's wrong with mr mendo?


[03-Feb-21 06:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I’ve been on VC with him and he seems really nice


[03-Feb-21 06:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
I was doing something harmless for fun literally harmless and he was just toxic about it, but maybe he was having a bad day? I will observe him during his time as senior though as maybe I'm wrong about him!


[03-Feb-21 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
hes active


[03-Feb-21 06:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Hmm okay.


[03-Feb-21 06:39 PM] stacey#1000
but sometimes is just like a rude attitude


[03-Feb-21 06:39 PM] lyss#0709
i dont think ive ever noticed him being rude and ive been really close with him for months


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’ve never had that experience with him, I know Bonnie said that too which I’m assuming with that incident up there but I personally have never seen him been rude


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
I regret having erick hired as senior, why would we want rude seniors.


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] lyss#0709
not at all to say that youre wrong though


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
I unvoted alex


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
They can be seniors though


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
But,


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
and idk who to vote now


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
idek who sarah is


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] stacey#1000
I never see her


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] lyss#0709
yeah welp some seniors are just gonna be practically rank locked at senior for eternity


[03-Feb-21 06:40 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Let me have a look at jacks activity rq. I know I’ve seen him around at my sessions a lot


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but gotta always look at other things too


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
If I'm not sure about someone in a shift vote in future I don't want them hired tho. I don't want a toxic hr in our LOVELY HR TEAM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
I want to vote addie but like


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
I still think she needs more time


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] stacey#1000
and she is busy with fs too


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] lyss#0709
u let me slip by tho! :)


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Addie is alright, maybe vac desveres my vote tho idk


[03-Feb-21 06:41 PM] lyss#0709
i like addie i think she'd make a good senior in another vote someday


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] lyss#0709
u ALSO let cory slip by


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i wouldnt want erick as a shift just my opinion


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] lyss#0709
now that hes back


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] cory!#8287
what u trying to say lyss.............


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] lyss#0709
oh


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] lyss#0709
dw about it!


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
I really want ot see vac as senior


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
like for sure im not removing my vote for vac


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
But no, ur a great hr lyss and I have no regrets on having you hired as a shift manager. Your true colours have shown, yes ur different to how u were as senior in my view but so is everyone once they get shift! Ur a good hr u just want to QUIT 24/7


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] cory!#8287
same i think vac would make a good addition


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
hes been a manager over a year


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh idk. I think we might as well give vac the chance at Senior. I think that’s our best option rn


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] cory!#8287
i always see him helping out managers


[03-Feb-21 06:42 PM] stacey#1000
and is really active


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk who else tbh


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] lyss#0709
well bonnie the thing is


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Jack if he keeps up his activity then def I’ll vote for him next time


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
I literally dont know who else to vote for


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] lyss#0709
i simply became better friends with kyle and thats about it for my personality changes


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] lyss#0709
.


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
im leaning towards addie but


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
addie is professional and nice


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] cory!#8287
u changed kyle lyss


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
let me see her activity


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I don’t think Kyle likes me anymore


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] lyss#0709
also on the day of my promo when u dmed me saying "ur true colors will show" i have never stopped thinking about that bc it is


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] cory!#8287
yeah addie is super active


[03-Feb-21 06:43 PM] lyss#0709
horrifyingly scary


[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] cory!#8287
if she keeps up her activity id vote for her next time


[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] lyss#0709
tbh i dont think kyle is changeable!


[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Literally every hr ever changes once they get promoted to shift!


[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] stacey#1000
o addie is really active


[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
I have observed it for 3+ years


[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[03-Feb-21 06:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh well


[03-Feb-21 06:45 PM] lyss#0709

[03-Feb-21 06:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[03-Feb-21 06:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Feb-21 06:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] stacey#1000
if vac gets in im happy


[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
When will the voting end? Imma have to think


[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I might could break a tie if i do wait


[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

idk how i feel


[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
U were always like really happy in my dms and stuff when u were senior and insulted Courtney with me, but like when u got shift manager it didn't change that much but ur not exactly like ur senior self, u are still happy u just want to quit!


[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN


[03-Feb-21 06:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] lyss#0709
thats probably bc


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] lyss#0709
i didnt


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] lyss#0709
talk to u


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] lyss#0709
often


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] lyss#0709
as a senior


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I feel like me and lyss KINDA got close? idk LOL


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
BUT u did like a few weeks before when I dmed u about Courtney


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
what made me get promoted to shift in like 6 months


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
im still confused on that


[03-Feb-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Feb-21 06:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
But whatever its my opinion and its nothing bad or whatever cuz like ur a very good hr. The things I don't like is bad true colours such as Emma and Jack @lyss


[03-Feb-21 06:48 PM] lyss#0709
stacey i would never be able to think of a reason u WOULDNT have gotten shift


[03-Feb-21 06:48 PM] cory!#8287
throwback to when lyss would do asmr 🤢


[03-Feb-21 06:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I feel like as Senior wise I only talk to a few people. The only seniors I really talk to rn are JJ Jr, Kyle, Acel, and little bit to Armani

[04-Feb-21 03:55 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hmmmmm is Grandmaswrinklybut :what:


[04-Feb-21 04:04 PM] katie#0200
ya ive noticed that too - she hasnt asked me to host in ages but i always noticed that she joins a server after shes asked


[04-Feb-21 04:08 PM] lyss#0709
yeah its weird, she has no reason to not know that rule


[04-Feb-21 04:08 PM] lyss#0709
one time i reminded her and then she still continued to not be in a server before asking


[04-Feb-21 04:14 PM] cory!#8287
YES SHE DOES THAT EVERY TIME WHEN SHE ASKS TO HOST FOR ME


[04-Feb-21 04:15 PM] lyss#0709

so


[04-Feb-21 10:11 PM] Fraux#7971
i just wanted to come and kinda clarify my inactivity bc i really don’t want u guys to think i just don’t wanna be active :( basically im just super busy bc it’s my senior year, plus i have a job with that so that takes up a lot of my time... also ive just finally been diagnosed w depression so along with that has taken motivation for me to do things as well as just eliminating my good moods in general. ik this is kinda tmi but i rly just don’t want anyone thinking bad about me!


[04-Feb-21 10:11 PM] Fraux#7971
but hopefully my meds will bring me back to doing the things i like so i do have some hope!

[08-Feb-21 05:21 AM] bonnie591#0591
@Polk transcripted ur old office, can i delete or do u still need it


[08-Feb-21 05:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
i would keep the management lounge archive and the staff lounge archive as they're very OG


[08-Feb-21 05:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
the others aren't as important


[08-Feb-21 06:54 AM] Polk#1596
ill delete it myself so it wont have a painful death


[08-Feb-21 03:47 PM] cory!#8287
am I allowed to tell an executive intern apart of sizzleburger why vUn1x was fired. they wanna know cause she probably applied to become an MR there so they probably want clearance if they should hire her or not

[08-Feb-21 04:36 PM] Beartikal#9760
whoever watching AOT final season damnnn its insane


[08-Feb-21 04:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal I caught up with the manga because the wait between each episode was killing me 😢


[08-Feb-21 04:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Now waiting for each manga chapter is killing me too


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
what


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
the manga isnt fully done yet?


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
No


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
It’s ending in April


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
2 more chapters to go


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
oh


[08-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
it seems like


[08-Feb-21 04:44 PM] Beartikal#9760
the anime is coming close to the manga


[08-Feb-21 04:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
im an anime-only because reading isnt the same as watching with music/sounds/voices, etc


[08-Feb-21 04:45 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Nah the anime is still like 20 chapters behind a lot of stuff happens it gets crazier than it already is


[08-Feb-21 04:45 PM] Tattoblue#5828
But it’s sooo so so good :PepeDance:


[08-Feb-21 04:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
but this the final anime season


[08-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
:A_Eyes_Pepo:


[08-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
so they have to finish it no


[08-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah, there’s gonna be 16 episodes for this season


[08-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
People are thinking that they’re gonna do a part 2


[08-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Like what they did with season 3


[08-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Beartikal#9760

Tsk tsk tsk


[08-Feb-21 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
It still violates ROBLOX TOS, wdym it doesnt affect us?


[08-Feb-21 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
Bypassing in any game on roblox is not allowed-


[08-Feb-21 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
We shouldnt ignore it just because it was on a different game


[08-Feb-21 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
we should at least warn her for violating TOS


[08-Feb-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
we fired other MRs for doing inappropriate stuff on other games that was not Bloxton


[08-Feb-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
so how is this any different?


[08-Feb-21 09:18 PM] Fraux#7971
What have we done for every other occurrence of this? To ensure we are consistent with repercussions


[08-Feb-21 09:18 PM] Fraux#7971
Specifically bypassing only


[08-Feb-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I think we should at least warn her


[08-Feb-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
other occurrences of this I cannot remember


[08-Feb-21 09:19 PM] Fraux#7971
Let’s use this occurrence to set a standard


[08-Feb-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
we have fired others for violating TOS before on other games


[08-Feb-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
moody and lane for example


[08-Feb-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
got fired for being inappropriate on another game server


[08-Feb-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
adding a vote


[08-Feb-21 09:20 PM] stacey#1000
we cannot ignore this


[08-Feb-21 09:20 PM] Fraux#7971
👍🏻


[08-Feb-21 09:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
now before i get issue my vote.


[08-Feb-21 09:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Wait


[08-Feb-21 09:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
let me see if i can find the term letters.


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ok, so moody didn't we fire because that was his second offense?


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and lanegorl didnt only get fired for the violating


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
she got fired for trashing talking and overall toxicity included


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
moody got fired because it was his second offence but he was still going to get suspended either way


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
mhm


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
im not saying she should get fired


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm just trying to make a vote based off previous outcomes


[08-Feb-21 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
I think we should at least give her a warning


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
i think firing her would be too extreme thats why i didnt put termination as an option


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah im not voting term


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
a warning or suspension would be best


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
I say warning


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
mhm


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
I think at most a verbal reminder


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] ethan;#0003
Not to bypass


[08-Feb-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000
yeah like just a minor thing to remind her instead of ignoring it


[08-Feb-21 09:29 PM] ethan;#0003
She instantly noticed she shouldn’t of said it


[08-Feb-21 09:29 PM] ethan;#0003
Showing she most likely won’t do it again


[08-Feb-21 09:29 PM] courtney#5125
i agree with ethan


[08-Feb-21 09:30 PM] stacey#1000
my vote is for verbal or written warning


[08-Feb-21 10:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
Don't worry, I'll deal with it. I'm gonna tell them about the situation briefly. And btw you can tell alliances information like that, you just need permission from a BOD to declassify what you want to share with them.


[08-Feb-21 10:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
Only like hrs of alliances though, don't tell Mrs or lrs of alliances if they ask


[08-Feb-21 10:37 PM] cory!#8287
alrighty!


[09-Feb-21 03:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
That's roblox problem, if they want to take action they can


[09-Feb-21 03:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
Oh no someone bypassed in a fucking laundry game


[09-Feb-21 03:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
Big deal


[09-Feb-21 03:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
She also clearly knows she shouldn't of done it so I don't even want a verbal reminder done


[09-Feb-21 03:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
So please don't even do a verbal reminder


[09-Feb-21 01:13 PM] cory!#8287

i didnt know u could complete a due date by just clicking on the date without touching the card


[10-Feb-21 01:59 PM] Polk#1596
and i made that mistake twice in a row both on the hr board and the training board in a timespan of less than 2 minutes...


[10-Feb-21 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
what a noob


[10-Feb-21 03:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@Polk i knew u could complete the due date by just clicking but i mistakenly did that 2+ by just missclicking while trying to open the card and edit the descriptions


[10-Feb-21 03:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and what am i suppose to be looking at in that photo?


[10-Feb-21 03:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@bonnie591 That I think what bear and baby could do is


[10-Feb-21 03:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
if they detect a change on the DisplayName


[10-Feb-21 03:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
then they could change it back or kick the player with a script


[10-Feb-21 03:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
or roblox will provide a way to disable that feature


[10-Feb-21 03:14 PM] Polk#1596
he made recordings at what i believe was ur gamenight


[10-Feb-21 03:14 PM] Polk#1596
and he didnt seem that good


[10-Feb-21 03:14 PM] Polk#1596

Same applies to what I said to anna, ethan and polk in announcements


[11-Feb-21 12:30 PM] cory!#8287

[11-Feb-21 12:32 PM] Tattoblue#5828
he couldve put more effort into that appeal 😬


[11-Feb-21 12:32 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that’s why I voted no


[11-Feb-21 12:33 PM] stacey#1000
Very short and doesn’t seem like he cares so no


[11-Feb-21 12:33 PM] katie#0200
ya agreed i thought he was gonna write more


[11-Feb-21 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 some people were asking me how long we give for nominations and voting for awards and I said one week each usually. Is that right? Cause idk I guessed and told them


[11-Feb-21 12:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
typically until the end of the month once we open it


[11-Feb-21 12:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
or a few days before


[11-Feb-21 12:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
1-2 weeks pretty much


[11-Feb-21 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
Like how long do they get for nominations alone


[11-Feb-21 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
And then voting alone


[11-Feb-21 12:37 PM] stacey#1000
And they wanted to know when it was starting too and I just said idk sometime soon


[11-Feb-21 12:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
form released at some point between 14-20th

[11-Feb-21 10:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Did we ever put a public announcement about the rule changes?


[11-Feb-21 10:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The discord rule changes to be specific


[11-Feb-21 10:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
because people in GD were getting pressed about CJ pinging a Senior to ban someone for swearing


[11-Feb-21 10:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but he didn't know about the rule change


[11-Feb-21 10:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
saying that the girl who swore left because of cj or something


[11-Feb-21 10:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i mean idk why she left, if she was gonna get banned then leaving wouldn't prevent anyone for banning


[11-Feb-21 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
No it was not announced cause people would abuse it


[11-Feb-21 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
It was announced to MRs

[11-Feb-21 10:29 PM] stacey#1000

4kitty is weird he keeps stalking me


[12-Feb-21 03:09 PM] ethan;#0003
ive had to unfriend him


[12-Feb-21 03:09 PM] ethan;#0003
because he kept following me into games


[12-Feb-21 03:09 PM] ethan;#0003
and he still finds what game im in


[12-Feb-21 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
kitty sends me a friend request


[12-Feb-21 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
everytime we're in the same game


[12-Feb-21 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
multiple times


[12-Feb-21 04:15 PM] lyss#0709
he sent me a friend request a while ago and i havent accepted it, so every time i talk in sl he's like "guys lyss wont accept my friend request" and makes it quite awkward


[12-Feb-21 05:07 PM] Polk#1596
lmaoo


[12-Feb-21 05:07 PM] Polk#1596

@lyss what you tell her.


[13-Feb-21 08:21 AM] stacey#1000
I fired her for being very unprofessional on group wall. I fired about 3 people. She was also only a rank 3.


[13-Feb-21 08:22 AM] stacey#1000
If she had a former MR role I would’ve added a vote to remove that as well. So if she tries to appeal for it she cannot get it rn


[13-Feb-21 10:39 AM] stacey#1000
@anna copper is talking in general discussion rn if u wanted to promote. I know you have by tomorrow so just letting you know


[13-Feb-21 10:41 AM] anna#0004

[13-Feb-21 10:42 AM] stacey#1000

[13-Feb-21 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
But he could go later yes ok gl


[13-Feb-21 10:45 AM] anna#0004
yeah if not i could just do it in dms later or something


[13-Feb-21 11:05 AM] lyss#0709
i told her she was fired for unprofessionalism on the group wall and she just responded like "ohhh yeah that makes sense"

[14-Feb-21 12:44 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Feb-21 12:44 PM] cory!#8287
ill see if he attends my themed session


[14-Feb-21 12:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes sir


[14-Feb-21 01:14 PM] Polk#1596
ok guys, here's my plan for promoting mendo if he wakes up:

i will host a paintball event/gamenight at the TC where we do HRS + MRs VS LRs, then afterwards i will gather everyone in the meeting room where i do MVPs of the match and promote him via a cool script 

please let me know if u wanna come! if he doesnt come online in the next 2 hours im gonna have to do it through dms sadly, so if u know him personally please lure him online @High Rank


[14-Feb-21 01:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
me


[14-Feb-21 01:16 PM] cory!#8287
im hosting a themed session at 4


[14-Feb-21 01:16 PM] cory!#8287
if u wanna try and get him to join that


[14-Feb-21 01:16 PM] cory!#8287
OR ur method works!


[14-Feb-21 01:18 PM] stacey#1000
If he doesn’t come online rip


[14-Feb-21 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
its gonna be impossible to do that with the amount of people joining themed sessions if i dont wanna make it obvious


[14-Feb-21 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
cuz he isnt a builder, right?


[14-Feb-21 01:21 PM] Polk#1596
well we actually talked exactly 24 hours ago


[14-Feb-21 01:21 PM] Polk#1596

oki brb


[14-Feb-21 02:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So how did you do the promotion?


[14-Feb-21 02:31 PM] cory!#8287
yess that looked awesome polk


[14-Feb-21 02:37 PM] Polk#1596
it was a paintball match


[14-Feb-21 02:37 PM] Polk#1596
and i made up some MVPs for the matches


[14-Feb-21 02:37 PM] Polk#1596
made everyone go into the meeting room


[14-Feb-21 02:38 PM] Polk#1596
announced the MVPs


[14-Feb-21 02:38 PM] Polk#1596
gave them cookies


[14-Feb-21 02:38 PM] Polk#1596
gave mendo a "magical cookie"


[14-Feb-21 02:38 PM] Polk#1596
executed a script and he got promoted


[14-Feb-21 02:38 PM] lyss#0709
pretty rigged that cat and i didnt win but i wont hold a grudge


[14-Feb-21 02:41 PM] Polk#1596
MVP for camping towers - cat and lyss!


[14-Feb-21 02:42 PM] Polk#1596
i was making them all up as it was going on LOL


[14-Feb-21 02:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think the next idea I would have is to make a voice recording of me saying So and So is getting promoted, put it in game and have a bunch of audios that play before that one


[14-Feb-21 02:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
then put it in gamenights


[14-Feb-21 02:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
sorta like a sit and wait game


[14-Feb-21 02:48 PM] lyss#0709

An aneurysm refers to a weakening of an artery wall that creates a bulge, or distention, of the artery. Most aneurysms do not show symptoms and are not dangerous. However, at their most severe stage, some can rupture, leading to life-threatening internal bleeding.

I mean we can’t really fire her for that but we can rank lock her at head. I mean at this point I’d never consider her for manager. At least for a long time


[15-Feb-21 11:20 AM] lyss#0709
emily is AwesomeGirl2386


[15-Feb-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
We can’t fire or suspend for calling 1 person toxic


[15-Feb-21 11:21 AM] lyss#0709

"What if someone was Head Recept and got promoted to management? Would they still get the head recept award" or something like that? 
"Do they not promote anyone until after the awards?"


[16-Feb-21 01:11 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Sitting in the vc I hear


[16-Feb-21 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
well then they'd win the best head award as an MR as the awards are nominated at the present time


[16-Feb-21 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
so since they voted while said person was head


[16-Feb-21 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
it counts


[16-Feb-21 01:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053

@xM_inn I DID IT ONE TIME YESTERDAY


[16-Feb-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
FOR THE FIRST TIME


[16-Feb-21 05:00 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yes


[16-Feb-21 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
I HOSTED EXCESS GMAES


[16-Feb-21 05:01 PM] Tattoblue#5828
whenever i host a training theres always atleast 1 LR that asks me if i do excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:01 PM] katie#0200
omg agreed i did it for the second time today


[16-Feb-21 05:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah I haven't done them before, WELL I MEAN I DONT HOST MUCH ANYWAY, but when I do host LRs have asked me too


[16-Feb-21 05:01 PM] anna#0004
yeah its annoying now everyone asks LOLL


[16-Feb-21 05:01 PM] katie#0200
fr every time i host theres at least like 5 lrs asking if im doing excess games its so annoying


[16-Feb-21 05:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
it seems its more seniors taking advantage and hosting it from what I've seen?


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] cory!#8287
i usually do excess games like not every training session but like once every 2-3 training sessions


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] cory!#8287
and yes its


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] cory!#8287
annoying when lrs ask you to do excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] katie#0200
it just takes so long and its a lot more effort for a single training session


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
keep discussing, I'll be back in a minute


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
someone decided to rob a bank on stapleton 😐


[16-Feb-21 05:02 PM] katie#0200
lol


[16-Feb-21 05:03 PM] cory!#8287
how fun


[16-Feb-21 05:03 PM] cory!#8287
i usually host them when i feel like it


[16-Feb-21 05:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i dont even know what excess games are, never seen em in action LOL i wouldnt even know what to do


[16-Feb-21 05:04 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 @Bloo_Berriez ik u said something about not letting quwanterz go on an inactive notice i think, so is he allowed to be on an inactive notice now?


[16-Feb-21 05:04 PM] katie#0200
yeah i did it once to promote someone and another time just because why not, i feel like they're really unnecessary becoming common bc they've become expected of every host and people come to trainings to train, not play games. if they wanna play games they should join actual roblox games


[16-Feb-21 05:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i dont make my managers stay


[16-Feb-21 05:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
whats his reason


[16-Feb-21 05:05 PM] cory!#8287
"I currently have exams and projects  that I still have to finish on those days. I want to focus on these tasks without distractions. I also want to change my sleeping schedule as it is really messed up right now and it is affecting my mental health in school."


[16-Feb-21 05:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
its only till 22nd so sure


[16-Feb-21 05:06 PM] cory!#8287
👍


[16-Feb-21 05:11 PM] lyss#0709
ive personally never done excess games but i notice a ton of seniors doing them, and i get asked at every session if there will be a game for excess. so yeah i think cutting back on them and/or setting a limit would be beneficial


[16-Feb-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve done excess games like 2-3 times


[16-Feb-21 05:12 PM] stacey#1000
But I don’t see what’s wrong with them either?


[16-Feb-21 05:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
OK I'm back


[16-Feb-21 05:13 PM] lyss#0709
they make sessions last like an hour longer than they should


[16-Feb-21 05:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
I understand why people do them as they're fun for LRs and stuff which is great of course


[16-Feb-21 05:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
but like


[16-Feb-21 05:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
don't forget its also a training session


[16-Feb-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
It’s just people doing harmless games. If a senior wants to take time to do it they should be allowed to. But when the server is actually done. Like the training part then they should end the server obv


[16-Feb-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
It’s never gone on longer at my sessions


[16-Feb-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
Seniors also already have to get permission from the main host to do excess games as well


[16-Feb-21 05:14 PM] lyss#0709
but it gets to a point where the games are just unnecessary, and some seniors will do excess games for like 45 minutes making the training go on wayy longer than what should be acceptable


[16-Feb-21 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
Most dont ask at mine. But if you don’t want them doing it just don’t give them permission to do it at your session


[16-Feb-21 05:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
The problem is LRs are expecting excess games every session, and it's defeating the purpose of excess games being a one-off special type of surprise


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm not saying we should remove them, but I do think we should start cutting it down to how it used to be with hosting them not as much


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
If they are doing excess games during the session then I don’t see a problem with it. When the main training is done then they should end it obv


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] lyss#0709
ive only had one senior ever ask me for permission to do excess games, and other seniors just do it without even mentioning it


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
seniors should def ask the host before doing it


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] lyss#0709
i feel like there should be a limit bccc it seems a bit unreasonable


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve never seen a training go on longer for it


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] cory!#8287
what lyss said


[16-Feb-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
Seniors are already supposed to ask before


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
If they don’t it is admin abuse


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] cory!#8287
i think only cat asked to do excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] cory!#8287
for me


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] lyss#0709
kyle's the only one who has ever asked me but like every other senior just does it


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
So if you know a senior is doing it without permission then give them consequences


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
Which seniors do it without permission


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] cory!#8287
some probably dont know that theyre supposed to ask


[16-Feb-21 05:16 PM] lyss#0709
i don't think giving consequences is the issue, i think it's just that games are happening way too often


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
No they should know. I’ve recently told 3-4 seniors they need to ask


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] cory!#8287
since most seniors are, well not like  super new, but newish


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] cory!#8287
oh


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
Vac asked me if he could and I allowed it


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
That was at my theme session tho


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] lyss#0709
and according to erick, it's causing problems with helpers and trainers rushing through training, resulting in poor performance there


[16-Feb-21 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
I let him do another themed server for my marvel theme session


[16-Feb-21 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
If anything I think we need a meeting with seniors on this


[16-Feb-21 05:18 PM] lyss#0709
like a quarter of the current seniors are relatively new, i doubt all of them are aware that they should ask first. regardless, i personally don't think that's the issue


[16-Feb-21 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t think this is something we should just limit without talking to seniors that actually do the excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Excess games are becoming something that LRs expect every session and it's no longer a surprise to them, which is defeating the purpose of why excess games exist. Fun is great, of course it is, and we shouldn't have to be professional all the time, but I also think the games are happening way too often. Excess games could be limited down and then more better, bigged, and well-planned events hosted instead. Don't forget a trainings and trainings and their purpose is to train trainees on their duties as an employee, so we shouldn't be doing games during a training nearly every session.


[16-Feb-21 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn’t happen at my sessions


[16-Feb-21 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
Like at all really


[16-Feb-21 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
But I think we should really talk to seniors more on this


[16-Feb-21 05:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright, well, how about we ask seniors for their insight on the problem. I can do a quick feedback vote on senior announcements and ask them to leave their opinions in senior lounge and then we can continue looking at further solutions once we have insight from them considering they're pretty much involved.


[16-Feb-21 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
They are the ones that do excess games more


[16-Feb-21 05:19 PM] lyss#0709
if people want more fun events, that's like what game nights are for


[16-Feb-21 05:20 PM] lyss#0709
better than turning training from a professional environment to a game every single session


[16-Feb-21 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
And if you do make an announcement to seniors. Remind them they are suppose to get permission from the main host to do excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
Because if they don’t it’s abuse


[16-Feb-21 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve only had like 1 LR ask for excess games. The same LR every time and I’ve said no


[16-Feb-21 05:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
Discussion is underway in senior lounge rn if you guys want to watch / join in


[16-Feb-21 05:32 PM] Polk#1596
That sounds a bit overdramatic, yes, LRs do ask a lot, but thats only because they enjoy excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:32 PM] Polk#1596
It should be in no way, shape, or form mandatory to host excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
i have the motivation to host to deny excess game requests


[16-Feb-21 05:33 PM] Polk#1596
But its not like we should hold back on doing them. If the host is willing to go out of their way to host excess games, then so be it


[16-Feb-21 05:33 PM] Polk#1596
I always try to finish my sessions within 1 hour


[16-Feb-21 05:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I can deny them, but i've only done a few. I don't make my managers stay. I let them know they don't need permission to leave.


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Only thing I really see thats maybe i could cause is a lot of messages about excess games


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
omg i just had a great idea


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
place those who ask for excess games to epic minigames


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
OMG IM HOSTING NOW


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
I NEED TO DO THAT


[16-Feb-21 05:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well, I don't think I have the place command


[16-Feb-21 05:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
because originally I was just gonna place excess to the hotel, but I ended up telling them to use the !hotel command


[16-Feb-21 05:36 PM] Polk#1596
Or just have them line up, gear yourself the laser gun, and enjoy


[16-Feb-21 06:06 PM] Polk#1596
"remove them entirely" and "host them occasionally" what do you mean by this? @xM_inn


[16-Feb-21 06:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LOL yeah i was about to say


[16-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
i feel like polk should be an exception


[16-Feb-21 06:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
he still needs to win best bod


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I like the idea but not the **entirely** idea


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
polks gonna win best bod


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
well,


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] Polk#1596
Im on the same page as bloo here


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] Polk#1596
I never knew so many people hosted excess games


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] Polk#1596
But i guess it really started going off recently...?


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i didnt know seniors were doing them cause no seniors ever ask me


[16-Feb-21 06:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
Remove them entirely from seniors


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
as mentioned in the meeting


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
Sure i never even knew they hosted them


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and if i do them, it's when i feel like it. there will be days when lrs ask and i'm like no


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
I thought it was only me tbh


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
Same


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] Polk#1596
Sometimes i need to go afk to do other things


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
basically


[16-Feb-21 06:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
just make sure ur not hosting them every session


[16-Feb-21 06:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
as it is defeating the purpose of them being a one-time special thing


[16-Feb-21 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hello! Welcome to Bloxton Hotels, how may I help you?

u've been typing for a long time


[16-Feb-21 06:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
IS that saying we only do 2 game nights a day???


[16-Feb-21 06:19 PM] Polk#1596
But listen, i just dont want excess games to be frowned upon. Theyre intended to be for fun and give LRs something to do in return for trying to help out, I only do them out of appreciation and to enhance and reinforce my bond with them. Excess games are not supposrd to be something special or anything like that, because having fun does not really need to be an occasional thing. I am 99% sure baby and bear want bloxton to be fun, not just straight to the point and strict. So yes, implementing stuff such as excess games is a great idea in my opinion. Yes, i do understand that it gets annoying if everyone just hosts four corners 24/7, so thats why i want people to refrain from doing them unless they have a good idea they can execute well. I just dont feel like it necessarily needs to be a themed session just to play games with them, themed sessions are a bit different and extremely well planned out. I would love to do excess games at like the hotel, but as we all know, we dont get btools there so its really difficult to recreate excess games that way. Gamenights are fun but it doesnt give you that feeling of bonding with them at our own group. My point is, excess games should just be something optional if you are going to put the effort and hard work into making them. I know a ton of LRs enjoy them, hence why they beg a lot, but cmon thats cause theyre kids. They are probably a little spoilt about it now that excess games drastically increased as a trend for seniors+, but if the host really doesnt want to host excess games, they can just say no. I am not against seniors hosting gamenights, but excess games should not be frowned upon


[16-Feb-21 06:20 PM] Polk#1596
I never even knew seniors hosted them, so i guess im fine if they arent allowed to host them anymore


[16-Feb-21 06:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wow polk... that was very moving. Touched my heart :sadSip:

[16-Feb-21 06:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but in all seriousness I really do agree with you polk. I personally host excess games as well, not ALL the time of course cause I barely host like 4 sessions a week but when I do, if I do them it’s because I feel the motivation and will go out of my way and put the time in there for them. Like I said I honestly had no idea seniors were doing them. Most of the time when I do them MRs and LRs are enjoying themselves that’s what honestly motivates me when I do feel to do them cause when I see LRs/MRs having fun, I mean what’s the problem you know? It’s not hurting anyone. I do agree it does sometimes gets annoying when LRs always ask about excess etc and if that’s something we can change and be more firm about it for example maybe including in our guides not to ask about excess games but yeah I agree with you polk


[16-Feb-21 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
Glad to hear it bloo


[16-Feb-21 06:27 PM] Polk#1596
Thats my same view on it, "its not hurting anyone"


[16-Feb-21 06:30 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I did excess games like during the weekend. It was fun. But, I noticed that I shouldn't use gears until after everyone was finished, so I did that. So I do 4 corners til everyone is done, then I proceed onto gears when management are finished so a staff or trainee doesn't kill anyone during training. I didn't think it was hurting anyone. I don't even make the managers stay. I even used :h to say that you no longer need to ask permission to leave. 
**But** this solution thats about to be implemented is kinda confusing to me so would someone like to fill me in?

I'm not against excess games, but the fact that they've become so common recently has become a bit of a problem since so many LRs ask us to host them and i feel bad when i say no, i feel like there's been this expectation from lrs for hosts to host excess games that when we say no, they think we're lazy (someone mentioned this in senior lounge), or they just don't enjoy our sessions, and then there's a huge bias arising between host preferences. honestly i obviously get why lrs prefer sessions with excess games but the fact that they get disappointed when we don't do something that we're not required to do makes it all a little discouraging which is why i believe more seniors have picked up hosting excess games. i think there were a few seniors who mentioned that some lrs come to training sessions for excess games, like one mentioned that a helper was upset when they were picked because they wanted to participate in excess games instead or something - this kinda defeats the whole purpose of trainings. i understand why it's not bad to make sessions more fun but trainings are for training people to become staff, and that's what lrs should be attending for, not excess games. I think that making this more of a common thing just reinforces this expectation which is what im pretty sure we're trying to avoid to make things more bearable for the seniors (and hrs) who dont want to/dont have the time/resources to host excess games. I'm not saying excess games should be frowned upon, I just think they should just be more of a special occasion thing or perhaps just something that isn't hosted as often to reduce the pressure to host them

yessss agreed


[16-Feb-21 06:52 PM] Polk#1596
I completely understand that katie, but what about us that actually put in a lot of effort into making them? I dont really want to host them monthly or something just because you guys dont host them at all. The LRs are being childish to assume every session is going to have excess games, as it should be completely up to the HR, but yeah thats because they are kids and that cant be stopped no matter what. If we stop hosting them they'll be like "where did excess games go?" like nothing would really change. If it is that big of a problem that you feel like it defeats the purpose of a training itself, i personally feel like you kind of misunderstand what bloxton is about. Yes theyre supposed to go to trainings to help and teach each other how to roleplay at the hotel, but we shouldnt get shocked if a kid wants to do something different other than being a helper. I look at it this way, they are giving their time helping me, so i offer them something back to show gratitude and get to know them more. Like it should only be optional of course but i just think its a bit overdramatic to stop hosting them because LRs are eager to attend them, even though it means they are only attending because of excess games. They come to have fun.


[16-Feb-21 06:53 PM] Polk#1596
But once again i understand your point of view


[16-Feb-21 06:53 PM] Polk#1596
But theres also another view to it


[16-Feb-21 06:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
It's nice that you want to put a lot of effort into an excess game, but you could put even more effort into making a well-planned event in itself with more than 1 game where more people than just excess can attend. That would show your appreciation to all of the LRs rather than the ones who just attend your training and everyone gets to have a lot of fun.

[16-Feb-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
Well I personally believe theres a difference to hosting big events and doing small things with them. Doing small things with them really strengthens our bond and makes us seem more like a family. Both things are great


[16-Feb-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
But the small things matter too

[16-Feb-21 07:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
100% see your side of it Katie. There’s strong arguments to both sides. I personally stand in between because excess games do no harm at all. It’s like Polk stated, I would probably say 70-80% of Bloxton are kids. And yeah sometimes they don’t know better. But what can we do, it’s ROBLOX. Tbh with Bloxton, we’re definitely a way different group than like 90% of the restaurant/hotel groups, whatever groups people have out there. My opinion on all of this is I don’t think there’s anything wrong with excess games. Is there downsides to it? Yes, definitely but I do think there’s ways we can improve the situation. Personally I’m going to include in my guide not to ask about excess games anymore and be more firm with it. I think in this situation, we can definitely implement both of the sides arguments from preventing this becoming a problem.


[16-Feb-21 07:16 PM] katie#0200
Yeah I definitely understand your point of view Polk, but I'm really just referring to the fact that Seniors have picked them up which obviously makes LRs think that excess games are becoming more of a standard thing. Trainings absolutely are a good opportunity for us to bond with our LRs and show our gratitude for their effort, but at the same time, not all of us have the time/effort to go to such lengths to make LRs enjoy our sessions. rather we could do this just simply by communicating with them more, not just through excess games. i'm not saying trainings should be all serious and only focused on doing necessary training procedures for trainees, but the "reputation" of training sessions has recently become more about making sure our LRs are satisfied, which is fine, but I'm sure that LRs were content with our level of making sessions enjoyable before excess games became more of a common thing. I support you guys hosting excess games for LRs because it's great to spend time with and get to know our staff, and I don't think that they should be completely removed at all - I'm rather insisting on the reduction (not elimination) of excess games from seniors to reduce the pressure/expectation that we have in regards to hosting them every session. yes, asking them to stop asking in our guides is a good way to resolve the problem of them asking (they'd probably still expect them from us), but I think that reducing them a little bit would subtly encourage the reduction in demand for them, not just in the form of them asking us but also in their expectations for them


[16-Feb-21 07:20 PM] Polk#1596
If that is what you're worried about katie, i am not against making it an HR only thing at all


[16-Feb-21 07:20 PM] Polk#1596
Like i said, i didnt even know seniors hosted them to such an extreme point


[16-Feb-21 07:21 PM] Polk#1596
That's a good solution bloo, i'll do that as well


[16-Feb-21 07:22 PM] katie#0200
yeah i think the recent vote we had about seniors hosting public gamenights will help especially now that we've had the senior team's input, i was just raising my concerns about how excess games are viewed currently


[16-Feb-21 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
Yeah I am sure that will help, as long as people dont think our sessions are degraded more than before because of excess games. Like thats not the intention at all


[16-Feb-21 07:27 PM] Polk#1596
We will never be able to satisfy all of our staff, but we can rather guide them in the right direction, as bloo said, and indirectly teach them not to act so demanding. I just dont think it should stop us from hosting them, theres too many benefits


[16-Feb-21 07:27 PM] katie#0200
Yeah agreed

[17-Feb-21 03:40 PM] Polk#1596
they definitely got it from someone because it talks about "NEW RULE: You can no longer use the H command at the hotel"


[17-Feb-21 03:40 PM] Polk#1596
i announced that to the whole mr team a few months ago


[17-Feb-21 03:40 PM] Polk#1596
but not my rules no


[17-Feb-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000

but all the other stuff

is in my rules


[17-Feb-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
(HOTEL RULES)

You will now be given mod at the hotel with the ability to kick anyone that commits a major offence or trollers with 3 warnings.

Major offences:

-Bypassing the chat filter
-Major spamming
-Inappropriate attire 
-Inappropriate/ offensive username 
-Exploiting
-Major trolling (kicked 3+ times)
-Glitching repeatedly
-Discrimination 


Like as an LR, you will need to report it in one of the reports channels in the Bloxton discord then kick the user.

For trollers with 3 warnings, you must check chatlogs to ensure the user actually has 3 warnings before kicking them. There can be cases where the user has false warnings or does not have 3 warnings at all, that is why you must check to ensure they have 3 valid warnings. 

If they have 3 valid warnings, you may kick the troller for 3 warnings.

Abusing staff members: You will find staff members abusing at the hotel, it is a given. If you're in that situation, go to the staff discussion channel via the Bloxton discord and request for a rank 11+. If an HR is online, provide the proof and username of the abuser on the staff discussion channel and ping them. Be sure to be respectful when pinging!

If a security is abusing handcuffs you may remove their tools or respawn them. 

Commands you can use at the hotel:

Be sure to NOT abuse at the hotel. This can and will get you fired. However, there are multiple commands you can use to your advantage.

Appropriate commands:

-view
-bring (i.e if someone is glitched or a troller is running)
-to
-kick
-chatlogs
-pm
-logs
-respawn (If a guest is AFK in the receptionist lane)
-removetools (I.e a cuff abuser)

You should not be using any other commands (I.e fly, m, etc)  except the commands listed above unless told otherwise by an HR.
On private servers (NOT public), you are allowed to use whatever commands you'd like.


[17-Feb-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
those are my hotel rules but I never had the NEW RULE: thing


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
probably a former head


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] Polk#1596
how long have you had those rules


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
those are my head rules


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] cory!#8287
yeah maybe


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] Polk#1596
because the "new rule" thing was announced months ago


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
a long time


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I dont got a "NEW RULE" thing


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
but i dont have the new rule thing


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
in my guide at all


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] Polk#1596
so it doesnt necessarily mean we have a leaker in the mr team rn


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
they could be made up honestly


[17-Feb-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
i mightve mentioned it to a former head that resigned awhile ago


[17-Feb-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
its not like i delete the rules after sending it to people I promote


[17-Feb-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
in case they need to go back and review it


[17-Feb-21 03:43 PM] anna#0004
yeah its in my rules i have some of ur guide but changed up a little which is why it looks similar @stacey im pretty sure its zachemamos as well i think he has a connection with winter and i promoted him

[18-Feb-21 04:32 PM] lyss#0709
omlll i agree for sure


[18-Feb-21 04:33 PM] lyss#0709
some ppl end up with 5 while others have 2 bc certain mrs like to start before the lobby is even clear so they can get done faster


[18-Feb-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
I tell MRs how many to take at my session


[18-Feb-21 05:00 PM] lyss#0709
most of the mrs dont really listen in my servers at least


[18-Feb-21 05:00 PM] lyss#0709
they still take as little as they want to


[18-Feb-21 05:02 PM] KjRBLX#2053
most likely someone will how many to get


[18-Feb-21 05:02 PM] KjRBLX#2053
then ill go thru the hall look into the office and try to sort out them evenly


[18-Feb-21 05:02 PM] KjRBLX#2053
like if someone has 2 and someone else has 4


[18-Feb-21 05:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ill take one from 4


[18-Feb-21 05:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and give one to 2


[18-Feb-21 05:03 PM] lyss#0709
i mean, its a bit difficult to even it out when some ppl have already gotten to question 4 before the lobby is empty


[18-Feb-21 05:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
oh um ive never really had that happen to me


[18-Feb-21 05:04 PM] lyss#0709
some people are good with taking the right amount and waiting to see if they should take more or not, but others just take one and immediately rush through the interview so they can leave


[18-Feb-21 05:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I don't let anyone teleport until i tell them to start teleporting, so they can't get far into the questions


[18-Feb-21 05:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
then after when the lobby is empty, i look thru the offices for a unfair amount, sort it out and just go on about my day


[18-Feb-21 05:07 PM] lyss#0709
right, but ive noticed a few times, personally, that as soon as i send the pm to begin, MRs will take 1 or 2 interviewees and start the questions before the lobby is clear so that they have an excuse not to take more


[18-Feb-21 05:07 PM] lyss#0709
but going through and evening out the offices is a good idea


[18-Feb-21 05:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i simply wont ask and just put that person in their office


[18-Feb-21 05:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm just a "Oh well" person, idc what question they on


[18-Feb-21 05:08 PM] lyss#0709
thats fair


[18-Feb-21 05:09 PM] lyss#0709
it gets a little bit annoying when theres 4 interviewees still in the lobby and everyone has already started asking the interview questions


[18-Feb-21 05:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
mhm


[18-Feb-21 05:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i just be like :h One more and someone will take them


[18-Feb-21 05:11 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i do too, a couple of times it's taken a good 2 minutes until someone brings the last few interviewees


[18-Feb-21 05:12 PM] lyss#0709
and by then everyone else is already on question 2 or even 3


[18-Feb-21 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i used to like do the grammar test in the office


[18-Feb-21 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and then when everyone finished


[18-Feb-21 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i would sort it out then


[18-Feb-21 05:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but i threw out that method

is that her first offense @KjRBLX


[19-Feb-21 01:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
🤷‍♂️ Only thing I remember about her is she bypassed in a laundrymat game, but Bonnie didn't want that to stick, so I'm guessing this is her first offense.


[19-Feb-21 01:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Oh


[19-Feb-21 01:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[19-Feb-21 01:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
She showed Uni something from staff lounge


[19-Feb-21 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But idk what's going on with that case


[19-Feb-21 01:18 PM] cory!#8287
idk if min did anything about that yet


[19-Feb-21 01:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The server is a "besties" server im in


[19-Feb-21 01:19 PM] Polk#1596
hm, either way that is pretty minor


[19-Feb-21 01:19 PM] Polk#1596
i wouldnt give anything more than a verbal warning unless she has an extensive record


[19-Feb-21 01:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[19-Feb-21 01:19 PM] Polk#1596

[19-Feb-21 01:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
:bloxton3: Staff Announcement :bloxton3: 

**2/19/2021**

Topic: “Shipping” 
     
    It has come to our attention that “shipping” staff members is on the rise. The HR team does not condone any of this. Please refrain from “shipping” staff members together. 

Examples: 
A. Making google forms to pair people together in a romantic relationship. 
B. Making false accusations that two staff members are dating. 

@Polk How's that?

Most of us were in the same dorm


[19-Feb-21 04:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Sille, Jaiden, Me, JJ, Fruitysam but Fruitysam wasn't in the vc


[19-Feb-21 04:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And there was some random person


[19-Feb-21 04:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
There's 5 beds


[19-Feb-21 04:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and sille didn't get one


[19-Feb-21 04:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I said "We would have to trade out"


[19-Feb-21 04:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ah! DS! I heard that game is holy!


[19-Feb-21 04:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Sille went to jumping on JJ's bed, and Jaiden said "This is not play time. Get it?"


[19-Feb-21 04:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I was just like 👁️ 👄 👁️


[19-Feb-21 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591

[19-Feb-21 04:15 PM] lyss#0709
jaiden's an interesting character from what ive heard, so i just try to avoid him now idk


[19-Feb-21 04:15 PM] Polk#1596
the event was so big we filled up two 50 player servers for both allies


[19-Feb-21 04:15 PM] Polk#1596
the management teams were concerned thinking it was a raid


[19-Feb-21 04:15 PM] lyss#0709
oh wow


[19-Feb-21 04:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053

they had a real raid


[19-Feb-21 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
a "karen" raid in another server


[19-Feb-21 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
thats why they got really concerned


[19-Feb-21 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
but u'd think our ALLIES would know our uniforms! smh


[19-Feb-21 04:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
TS came to the hotel in their uniform once


[19-Feb-21 04:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and i thought they were trollers


[19-Feb-21 04:27 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i guess thats true


[19-Feb-21 04:27 PM] Polk#1596
i guess the bloxton logo on our uniforms in the playerlist was less visible than i thought


[19-Feb-21 06:32 PM] Beartikal#9760
hey guys is Solera hotels & resorts on blacklist


[19-Feb-21 06:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
they want to ally (albeit i dont like them because they pretty much ripped off our logo)

I haven't fully scanned the video yet


[19-Feb-21 09:41 PM] cory!#8287
pretty sure it’s the same rules I posted a couple days ago


[19-Feb-21 09:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
thought so


[19-Feb-21 11:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey bonnie asked baby and baby said he was gonna add a feature where you could lower the boom boxes, something like that.


[19-Feb-21 11:53 PM] stacey#1000
Ok but for right now. What do you think about people like getting warned and at least kicked for it?


[19-Feb-21 11:53 PM] stacey#1000
Cause idk what to tell the MRs rn


[19-Feb-21 11:54 PM] stacey#1000
Can we have someone announce this


[19-Feb-21 11:54 PM] stacey#1000
So they don’t keep complaining to me about it when idk what to tell them


[19-Feb-21 11:54 PM] stacey#1000
I just tell them they can mute it


[19-Feb-21 11:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Although I’m not sure baby wants anyone to be banned or kicked for audios since people can mute. I remember we talked about it and I don’t think baby wants anything to be done since he said he will add that feature. Bonnie asked today actually so idk how fast baby will get that done.


[19-Feb-21 11:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@babymariobebe


[19-Feb-21 11:56 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t think they should get banned for it


[19-Feb-21 11:56 PM] stacey#1000
But I mean if people are clearly following MRs around into servers playing the loud music on purpose to troll can they at least like get warned or something


[19-Feb-21 11:58 PM] lyss#0709
but if ppl have the ability to just mute the boomboxes then i don't think it's a huge issue


[19-Feb-21 11:58 PM] stacey#1000
The issue is people don’t know about mute boomboxes all the time


[19-Feb-21 11:58 PM] stacey#1000
And don’t know how to


[19-Feb-21 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
And staff members are not there all the time to tell them


[20-Feb-21 12:00 AM] lyss#0709
if there aren't staff members in the server then it's not like the person could be warned or kicked anyways


[20-Feb-21 12:00 AM] babymariobebe#7563
@here I'll likely patch the loud music exploit with a script that alters loud audio based on PlaybackLoudness


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
well


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
not really exploit


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
but you know


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
I'll have to get to that eventually


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Let me know if it persists and ill make it top priority


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
if need be


[20-Feb-21 12:01 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Ill have it patched though


[20-Feb-21 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
Apparently people love following MRs into servers rn to play the loud music so I guess rn it’s bad


[20-Feb-21 12:02 AM] babymariobebe#7563
Someone find me a super loud earrape sound so I can test in studio with it 😂


[20-Feb-21 12:02 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Just ask verrdin


[20-Feb-21 12:02 AM] KjRBLX#2053
more loud audio problems i hear about is related to her


[20-Feb-21 12:02 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah verrdin at the hotel rn playing the loud music


[20-Feb-21 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
Nvm she left


[20-Feb-21 12:04 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll try to find a random loud audio

[21-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
I know someone did


[21-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Awhile ago


[21-Feb-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
I think it was fraux


[21-Feb-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000

jsyk (basically jack thought he had to change their rank after being suspended so they couldnt see team chat & radio so he changed it and their username was still in the LRs part so it was their username and Hotel Guest in the lrs part if that makes sense...!)

because an invite will easily get leaked


[22-Feb-21 09:57 PM] Polk#1596

[22-Feb-21 10:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i really dont see the point of it


[22-Feb-21 10:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
its basically a extension of staff lounge and mr channels.


[22-Feb-21 10:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and some of the public channels


[22-Feb-21 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
they arent allowed to make MR servers like that without permission-


[22-Feb-21 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
thats what staff lounge is for


[22-Feb-21 10:17 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i thought that as well


[22-Feb-21 10:17 PM] lyss#0709
that seems highly unnecessary


[22-Feb-21 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
im joining to tell them


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
they are suppose to get permission


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
to make MR serverslike that


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] lyss#0709
who even made the server


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
because then there is no point in a staff lounge


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] lyss#0709
4kkittyy??


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] lyss#0709
right


[22-Feb-21 10:18 PM] Polk#1596
you can shut down the whole thing


[22-Feb-21 10:19 PM] Polk#1596
he can own a server and have mrs in it, but it shouldnt be named "mr hangout server" with promotion and resignation channels


[22-Feb-21 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
they can like make their own discord servers themselves but if its like specific an MR hangout that defeats the point of staff lounge no


[22-Feb-21 10:19 PM] Polk#1596
everything bloxton related needs to be removed


[22-Feb-21 10:19 PM] Polk#1596
are u gonna tell em @stacey


[22-Feb-21 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
do u want me to make an announcement to all MRs


[22-Feb-21 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
to tell them not to make servers like that and to leave it


[22-Feb-21 10:22 PM] stacey#1000
ya im gonna do that


[22-Feb-21 10:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah idk why they thought that was a good idea. Unnecessary


[22-Feb-21 10:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we have a staff lounge for a reason


[22-Feb-21 10:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[22-Feb-21 10:28 PM] ethan;#0003
They aren’t allowed to do it in general


[22-Feb-21 10:28 PM] ethan;#0003
There used to be very strict rules about creating servers designated to only bloxton talk


[22-Feb-21 10:35 PM] stacey#1000
announcing now


[22-Feb-21 10:35 PM] ethan;#0003
Can I message kitty


[22-Feb-21 10:35 PM] ethan;#0003
To delete the server


[22-Feb-21 10:35 PM] ethan;#0003
Or face action


[22-Feb-21 10:35 PM] ethan;#0003
@Polk


[22-Feb-21 10:38 PM] Polk#1596
you can definitely do that @stacey


[22-Feb-21 10:38 PM] Polk#1596
i thought we made that exact announcement a few months ago though


[22-Feb-21 10:38 PM] Polk#1596
but i guess newer mrs dont know


[22-Feb-21 10:38 PM] stacey#1000
announced


[22-Feb-21 10:38 PM] Polk#1596
you can @ethan;


[22-Feb-21 10:38 PM] Polk#1596
unless stacey told kitty alreayd


[22-Feb-21 10:39 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey did u


[22-Feb-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
I announced it


[22-Feb-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
to all MRs


[22-Feb-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
look at staff announcements


[22-Feb-21 10:39 PM] ethan;#0003
I’m going to dm kitty to delete the server


[22-Feb-21 10:39 PM] stacey#1000
I didnt specifically call out kitty


[22-Feb-21 10:40 PM] stacey#1000
I didnt dm her I was busy making announcement so ya u can dm her


[22-Feb-21 10:40 PM] Polk#1596
then you can dm kitty and use the announcement as reference ethan


[22-Feb-21 10:40 PM] lyss#0709
odd that kitty would think he's allowed to do that but


[22-Feb-21 10:40 PM] stacey#1000
apparently Builder got permission to make a head of services hangout?

[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] lyss#0709
that's just plain exclusion mate


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
but whatever HR gave them permission to make one


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] Polk#1596
?kick user you got promoted to management rip


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] Polk#1596
or


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] Polk#1596
time to give you the former head of services role!


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] stacey#1000
telling her to delete it


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] Polk#1596
just tell them to shut it down as well stacey


[22-Feb-21 10:41 PM] Polk#1596
yesyes


[22-Feb-21 10:43 PM] Polk#1596
@High Rank not sure if anyone here actually gave permission to someone to create an MR/head of services only discord server, but from now on never give them permission please


[22-Feb-21 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
I think it was a former HR that did


[22-Feb-21 10:43 PM] stacey#1000
they had it since July apparently


[22-Feb-21 10:44 PM] Polk#1596
that is a long time


[22-Feb-21 10:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Head of services hangout- LOL


[22-Feb-21 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
ok its deleted


[22-Feb-21 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
the head of services one


[22-Feb-21 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; thats ROBLOX fault


[22-Feb-21 10:46 PM] stacey#1000
I already talked to imag about it


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] lyss#0709
well


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It’s been like that for a while hasn’t it? I use info to see who has safe chat


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] lyss#0709
that is a conundrum


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] ethan;#0003
I name them still


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Info helps to see who has it or not


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] lyss#0709
isnt info like


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] lyss#0709
not reliable


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] ethan;#0003
Probs need to tell seniors


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah it’s not reliable


[22-Feb-21 10:47 PM] lyss#0709
it doesnt always have the right information


[22-Feb-21 10:48 PM] ethan;#0003
We need to find a new word then


[22-Feb-21 10:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought naming wasn’t because I do both name and info but when I name C7RN it’s not tagged but when I info it says they have safe chat


[22-Feb-21 10:48 PM] Polk#1596
wait what?


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] Polk#1596
idk how we can find a new word


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] ethan;#0003
I remember C7RN stopped working I. 2017 for awhile


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] lyss#0709
we should like use


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] lyss#0709
bloxton 😁


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] Polk#1596
actually thats true


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] Polk#1596
they cant say bloxton without going blox-ton


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] lyss#0709
yessss


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] Polk#1596
but we should test it first!


[22-Feb-21 10:49 PM] ethan;#0003
I’ll ask the mrs to test that they where testing in sl


[22-Feb-21 10:50 PM] ethan;#0003
I’ll ask if bloxton is tagged


[22-Feb-21 10:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Still


[22-Feb-21 10:50 PM] Polk#1596
so its not official


[22-Feb-21 10:50 PM] Polk#1596
its just something mrs have been testing and it stopped working


[22-Feb-21 10:50 PM] Polk#1596
i think literally all of roblox uses that word


[22-Feb-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
Yes bloxton is still tagged


[22-Feb-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
If we use bloxton then we can get other groups to use it


[22-Feb-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003

I told the seniors to just make people say Bloxton for safechat test for now and then to do the Info command since they were unsure of what to do

[24-Feb-21 12:39 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey Hey i don't think using Bloxton for safechat test is reliable


[24-Feb-21 12:39 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Just did it at my session rn and wasn't workin


[24-Feb-21 07:21 AM] stacey#1000

[24-Feb-21 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn ive legit told him twice he can never appeal and he keeps wanting to contact different HRs about it thinking he still has a chance


[24-Feb-21 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
there should be no reason why he keeps contacting to ask the same thing...


[24-Feb-21 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
he was appealed before and ruined it, he cant get appealed again


[24-Feb-21 09:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
okay I'll tell him that, and I'll also tell him that continuing to ask different hrs in hope of seeking a different answer is not going to do him any favours


[24-Feb-21 09:26 AM] stacey#1000
thats probably why ethan blocked him because he keeps asking the same thing and has been told mulitple times he can never appeal


[24-Feb-21 09:27 AM] ethan;#0003
the dude


[24-Feb-21 09:27 AM] ethan;#0003
doesnt understand


[24-Feb-21 09:27 AM] ethan;#0003
what


[24-Feb-21 09:27 AM] ethan;#0003
"no appeals means"


[24-Feb-21 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
he says he understands he was fired and suspended 7+ times and has been told because of it he can never appeal and yet still things he can...?

Okay let's see if he actually keeps his word


[24-Feb-21 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes and like I’d say most of the server wasn’t tagged with like 10 people who had it tagged and I doubt all those people who didn’t have it tagged don’t have safe chat cause it was a lot of security and bar and I tried it on Lee and it would tag sometimes and not tag so


[24-Feb-21 12:28 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez it worked on mine fine idk

I hope they make a way to mute people like permanently in game or so


[26-Feb-21 01:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
- being able to game mute people - disable voice in studio - they prob have a feature where u have to be around them to hear what they say or can be on full server talk


[26-Feb-21 01:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Maybe they’ll add built in admin commands for it

roblox can barely moderate anything on the website idk what makes them think they can moderate voice chats


[26-Feb-21 05:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053

@bonnie591 So, I can promote eqddie?


[26-Feb-21 08:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053

yup! you can! @KjRBLX


[26-Feb-21 08:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
alright, gonna do some more digging before i go full out with my idea


[27-Feb-21 08:55 AM] cory!#8287
@anna I’ve gotten reports of her trash talking Bloxton with ayesha still so i don’t think she should get the former role yet


[27-Feb-21 08:59 AM] stacey#1000
I voted no cause I think she needs more time considering she got fired just a month ago for leaking a lot of information


[27-Feb-21 08:59 AM] stacey#1000
She still hangs out with ayesha and stuff too so


[27-Feb-21 09:06 AM] anna#0004
ah ok thanks guys!


[27-Feb-21 09:49 AM] stacey#1000

@bonnie591 or maybe you promoted them I forget


[27-Feb-21 09:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
cant remember


[27-Feb-21 11:03 AM] katie#0200
He’s been blacklisted like twice or thrice idk, he made an alt called bubblegumtube which I promoted back in jan 2020 and then we fired him like instantly bc someone reported that to me


[27-Feb-21 11:04 AM] katie#0200
He claims his cousin uses the bubblegumtube account now but I can’t prove that


[27-Feb-21 11:04 AM] katie#0200
I told him he can’t appeal tho


[27-Feb-21 11:04 AM] katie#0200
So I guess he’s trying to by going to other hrs


[27-Feb-21 11:06 AM] katie#0200
I told him he can’t appeal because he’s been blacklisted at least twice and he’s done some really extreme things like he was a cb for quite a while, if u search iiL0ui on trello ull see the things he’s done
