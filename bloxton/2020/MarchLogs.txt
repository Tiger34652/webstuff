PLEASE


[01-Mar-20 01:57 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Just added you all to the investigation board (bman got removed for being rude, dont be next). If you guys get a report that needs investigation, please put proof and an explanation under "reports" and someone will look at it. Y'all can help investigate too, just make sure you let me or Minn know what's going on. If you don't want to investigate, then one of the five people listed on the left will take over. DO NOT INVOLVE MRS IN INVESTIGATIONS so help me god I will have an aneurysm. They are to be *questioned*, not to do the questioning. Okay have fun.

[01-Mar-20 05:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
Knock knock


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
if it was some other mr we would suspend them


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
pretty sure we suspended flurry for this


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
trying to start drama


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] emma;#1525
we wouldn’t suspend an MR bc they got upset over a name change lmao tf


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] emma;#1525
Not unless it got super out of hand


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Flurry was worse, Bman. What are you on about?


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
k emma


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] emma;#1525
Which idk bc your VIDEO DOESNT WORK


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
just go to sl


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
start from 1:37 pm wst


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
est


[01-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435
and scroll down


[01-Mar-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And plus, Flurry was suspended for two instances of him causing issues.


[01-Mar-20 05:18 PM] bman#0435
it was going on for like over 10 mins


[01-Mar-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
One for basically dismissing Saab's doxing story and pretty much picking on Lucas.


[01-Mar-20 05:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Polk why not! :(


[01-Mar-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not to mention, he basically kind of threatened him by saying something about beating his ass. And was kind of toxic by asking him if he went to a high-school party.


[01-Mar-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
well i sent in the application right now


[01-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Both are really dumb instances of drama, but Saab's is a lot more tame than Lucas is.


[01-Mar-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
I mean the fact that Saab doesn’t like void’s name but is fine with Manager Alex’s name which is almost the same is wild


[01-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Flurry* Excuse me.


[01-Mar-20 05:20 PM] Polk#1596
if i pass i will probably not be able to do BTOCs before the next application period


[01-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I doubt he knows who Guest was at all.


[01-Mar-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it was maybe a coincidence.


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like, I know Guest was extremely awful but like, don't do that to a new MR. 🙄


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] emma;#1525
And y’all want SLEE to be a manager again

[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
I just reviewed the chat


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] emma;#1525
They ganged up on Alex


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] emma;#1525
and made him feel bad for no reason


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I agree.


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] emma;#1525
Saab is 23


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] emma;#1525
She needs to learn to handle herself


[01-Mar-20 05:22 PM] a. ღ#4222
Plus they said it’s an “opinion” like don’t state an opinion if it’s rude


[01-Mar-20 05:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm split between a verbal warning or a suspension. Although, I think a suspension might not be the option to go with.


[01-Mar-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
Idk if a suspension is my first choice since she did go through a lot but this was pretty immature so idc much either way


[01-Mar-20 05:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
damn it emma


[01-Mar-20 05:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[01-Mar-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
I think we should make a gc with Slee and saab


[01-Mar-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
ya


[01-Mar-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
And talk it out with them


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
yaya


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
And based on their reactions decide what to do


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But why though?


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
If they take it well we can leave it with a warning


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
but no matter what they say there def should be a consequence


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
Bc I don’t want them ganging up on people again


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sorry I don’t mean to bring it up again but SHES 23? 😳 I thought she was like 19 or 20


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
Like they ALWAYS do


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
SAME BLOO


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma, I'm sorry but, I kind of disagree.


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
When it comes to one of them


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Let's look at it this way.


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] emma;#1525
You disagree with talking to them about why their actions aren’t acceptable?


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] bman#0435
i think it was cleae what thwir intentions were but im not against talking to them


[01-Mar-20 05:26 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg but I think they were right to gang up on him tho, I think they need a consequence regardless of what we say to them

#deleted-channel


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, there's no reason to if we just send them the warning.


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's not like we're suspending them what so ever.


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
stort-


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
Trey whenever I warn I almost always have an actual conversation


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
y r u saying that they shouldve ganged up-


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
Bc it leads to a better understanding of what they did


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
I MEAN NOT RIGHT


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
And why they need to stop


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
OMG


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
Just sending a paragraph does nothing


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
LMAO


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] a. ღ#4222

SORRY


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
if a paragraph does nothing to a senior _COUGH ANNA COUGH_ then ya


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
We’re dealing with someone older than both of us, she’s not gonna just take a paragraph to heart


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Isn't notifying them for a warning enough really?


[01-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
No...?


[01-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think so in this case


[01-Mar-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435
they were also both seniors and a shift manager


[01-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Exactly.


[01-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
Saab and Slee have a history of hanging up against people


[01-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

DONT


[01-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435
ok well if they have a history of ganging up on people then i think a suspension would do


[01-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
So why do you think just a quick warning is enough?


[01-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435
3 days


[01-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435

@High Rank So about the Void thing; when I saw them arguing in SL, I stopped the discussion and had them continue their conversation in DMs. I then DM'ed Saab and Slee and requested for their point of view on the situation, and which they responded how his name looked like Guest's and they had told Void prior to changing his name that it was similar to Guest's, who has done a lot of bad things in the past. Regardless, around 30 minutes later, he stilled changed his name, knowing that it could potentially upset Saab. Now, of course he has a right to change his name to whatever he desires, but surely you'd think he would at least consider other's feelings, right? He also told Saab to "Get Over" what Guest had done in the past, which is a little wrong considering he has no idea of the full ins and outs of what happened. Saab and Slee explained their side of the story and Slee apologized that he didn't handle the situation as well as he should've.

I then asked Void a few questions in DMs regarding the situation, and I was basically trying to find out if changed his name with motive to upset Saab or anything like that to which he responded no. I asked him if he knew about Guest, and he also responded no, which was where he lied to me because he clearly knew about Guest prior to changing his name as proved by a discussion in staff lounge on Friday. I then asked a few questions in different ways and he consistently stated he did not know of anyone with a similar name to him. I then confronted him for lying to me and he said he just didn't want to get in trouble. I think told him that the situation was under review and I'd look into it again later as I had to go do Stapleton work.

Kinda confusing, enjoy reading.

he had a pretty good idea bman


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
saab said he was a scammer and did a lot of stuff to her in the past


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] bman#0435
also if saab and slee dont like his name change then they can give him 1k


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
they're all involved, and none of them are innocent. let's stay open-minded with the situation.


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] a. ღ#4222
Telling her to “get over it” could be wrong but she started it by literally telling him that she didn’t like it and it reminded her of guest. It’s his username, his choice


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn literally alex the manager has like the same name


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] emma;#1525
and saab and slee didnt give a fuxk


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] emma;#1525
this is targeted


[01-Mar-20 05:56 PM] a. ღ#4222

i dont care that he changed his name but saab and slee shouldnt of had publicized it


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
like a dm would have done


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
either way, void still lied to me 🤷‍♂️


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
but they made a big deal abt it in sl


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
and are you saying void only changed his name *after* saab said it bothered her


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
what exactly did he lie abt tho


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
like knowing about guest?


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525

[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525

[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
when did void and Saab have a discussion


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
said it in sl


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
saab said no


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
and he did it anyways


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] bman#0435
today


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
i'd personally just like to end the situation with me speaking to slee, saab and void and explain to them individually of how they handled situations wrong


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn i still have questions


[01-Mar-20 05:57 PM] a. ღ#4222

ok ask question


[01-Mar-20 05:58 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
void lied to min basically to avoid punishment


[01-Mar-20 05:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
maybe someone could explain lol


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
did void only lie to Minn because he'd already been attacked by saab and slee and made to feel like he did something wrong


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435
same as stort


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] xM_inn#2821
idk


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
and since slee and saab hold more power than other MRs in their mind


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
bc of their former HR and senior status


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435
what did he lie about


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
mhm


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] bman#0435
just knowing abt guest?


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
did that make void feel like he'd be in trouble


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
I don’t think void majorly lied or intended to lie


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what did he change his username to


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn i still want clarification on what you meant by "Regardless, around 30 minutes later, he stilled changed his name"


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
At the end of the day he changed his name, Saab and slee didn’t like it and made a big deal which resulted in bullying, and void thought he was in trouble


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"stilled"


[01-Mar-20 05:59 PM] emma;#1525
i thought he'd changed his name and THEN saab got upset


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] emma;#1525
but youre making it seem like saab was upset AND THEN he changed his name


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; So


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
honestly if u ask someone if they know "Guest" especially when they just found out its HIGHLY unlikely he knew the exact person u were talking about


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What do you mean by so?


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
like saab and slee knew him for years but void learned about him for like a hot second


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oo gn


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
Trey wait for him to explainnnn


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
and possibly forgot who he was right after


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] a. ღ#4222
Gn Bonnie


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] bman#0435
GN BONNIE


[01-Mar-20 06:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
GN kind people


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
On Friday, Alex was asking for name suggestions in SL, and Alex said his name proposal, Saab said "Ew that sounds like Guest" or something like that and basically explained how it was like Guest's name and some of the things he had done in the past, however 30 minutes later, Alex still changed his name to that willingly knowing it could upset Saab


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma;


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] a. ღ#4222
Her getting upset over Alex’s name is like me getting upset over the girl cinder


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
hold up


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] emma;#1525
um


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] bman#0435
um


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like the girl alex


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] emma;#1525
saab doesnt hold a claim over "alex"


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
no


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
have a really similar username


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
alex is void


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] bman#0435
how would alex do it "willingly knowing it could upset saab"


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think void did it to upset alex i think he did it bc its his fuqin name


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; ik, read what i said above, im just explaining the part u requested


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] bman#0435
he clearly liked the username he came up with


[01-Mar-20 06:01 PM] bman#0435
because if he didnt then he wouldnt change it


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] bman#0435
@emma; ur dumb void and alex are the same person


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] bman#0435
stupiddddddddddddd


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think she meant Saab


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ye


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
tbh, this situation is quite weird and confusing, maybe we should just speak to slee saab and void and give them a verbal warning or something?

[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] Cooqkie#2809
is just like voids


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
I don’t think void deserves punishment


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] a. ღ#4222
Honestly it seems unfair


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] bman#0435
dont u think making a gc with all of them would just make matters worse


[01-Mar-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
@bman dude i know that


[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
not a GC........


[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525

[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] xM_inn#2821

[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh no bman lol


[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
I dont think we should punish void because saab got upset for a bad reason


[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] bman#0435
i dont think we punishing void


[01-Mar-20 06:03 PM] Cooqkie#2809
saab and slee need a written warning @xM_inn

[01-Mar-20 06:06 PM] bman#0435

[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] emma;#1525
ok


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] emma;#1525
lmk what you're sending to slee


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
but no suspensions cause i think its too far for the matter at hand


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] emma;#1525
and i'll send it to saab and talk with her


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
min when did Saab tell void it was a bad name to change to


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
bullying is something consistent, its not something slee and saab are known for, its clearly a one time incident and slee apologized


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
@a. ღ like 30 mins before he changed it


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
Did slee apologize to void or too u


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
To*


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
me


[01-Mar-20 06:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
So today they talked about it?


[01-Mar-20 06:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
Ok well slee should apologize to void


[01-Mar-20 06:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think lol


[01-Mar-20 06:08 PM] bman#0435
ok


[01-Mar-20 06:08 PM] bman#0435
my question


[01-Mar-20 06:09 PM] bman#0435
y wouldnt a suspension be a good option. like they started drama in sl and were acting unprofessional abt it all, and ganged up on him.


[01-Mar-20 06:09 PM] bman#0435
saab and slee are apparently known for ganging up on people too


[01-Mar-20 06:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
since when did we have to be professional in staff lounge


[01-Mar-20 06:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
and proof to support your claim is where exactly? @bman


[01-Mar-20 06:09 PM] bman#0435

[01-Mar-20 06:09 PM] emma;#1525

Hands down! For the first time, I've never seen a training process at a cafe like @VentiRBLX become so simple & easier to understand. It's really rare to see other cafes have this whereas they have like a billion steps to make something. I hope it continues like this. Keep it...

@xM_inn i told her not to talk about demotions for no reason bc its gossipy and we dont need that


[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
like if an MR asks straight up im not gonna lie but imag doesnt need to be like "omg did you know so and so was actually FIRED"

[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525

[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
most previous terminations arent necessarily a current threat at the moment, so unless they become an active threat then lets avoid bringing them up


[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] emma;#1525
i mean it doesnt really come up


[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I HAVEN'T EVEN NOTICED


[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] a. ღ#4222
I asked if I could say she was fired and I was told no


[02-Mar-20 02:23 PM] a. ღ#4222

[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
but that was awhile ago so I never brought it up again


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
im pretty sure at least one of us said she was fired when it all happened


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
no


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they announced she was fired for seniors


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
we let her say she resigned


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
and i was PISSED


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] bman#0435

[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
but the thing is her firing was january 2019 so do we really need to bring it up when nobody really knows her anymore


[02-Mar-20 02:24 PM] emma;#1525
i started telling people she was fired when they asked

Good afternoon Stacey,  

(This DM goes to the selected tweets of HRs of Bloxton) (Tell Bonnie or show Bonnie this since idk his Discord) 


In response to your tweet along with many other complaints. I have decided to take down that tweet to avoid any confusions whatsoever. For your info, that tweet was not meant to be targeted against Hilton / Bloxton nor be biased about it. It was only meant to be an opinion based on the polls. I never had any intentions to spread any hate nor confusions towards Bloxton Hotels whatsoever. I do sincerely apologize about that tweet since I never had realized at first that it would hurt a lot of people. What I can say is, that I am humbled and proud of Bloxton Hotels. Of course, I do agree that there are improvements that I think is necessarily needed. Yes, we can voice our opinions about something else in everything. However, I didn't mean to be aggressive or offending anyone with that tweet whatsoever. I also want you to send this post to the HRs. Especially, to Bonnie because I don't know his Discord since for whatever reason it disappeared. I appreciate everything in Bloxton, I appreciate the members, and especially for everything I've accomplished along with forming friendship with others as well. I am thankful by today's standards to still have those who still support me to continue supporting me. I am not here treating anyone trash or pointing out that he or she is trash. All I am voicing, is my opinions like someone would do. Yes, someone will have criticism about it. But I didn't expect that this tweet what offend a lot of you. I understand, I will take the responsibility fore-granted. Because it was my mistake, and I should've noticed about this in the first place. I went too much based on what the public was thinking about instead of thinking about reality. Overall, I hope you all understood to what I said so far. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to DM me. Thank you! -Jackovation

[02-Mar-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000
Good afternoon Stacey,  

(This DM goes to the selected tweets of HRs of Bloxton) (Tell Bonnie or show Bonnie this since idk his Discord) 


In response to your tweet along with many other complaints. I have decided to take down that tweet to avoid any confusions whatsoever. For your info, that tweet was not meant to be targeted against Hilton / Bloxton nor be biased about it. It was only meant to be an opinion based on the polls. I never had any intentions to spread any hate nor confusions towards Bloxton Hotels whatsoever. I do sincerely apologize about that tweet since I never had realized at first that it would hurt a lot of people. What I can say is, that I am humbled and proud of Bloxton Hotels. Of course, I do agree that there are improvements that I think is necessarily needed. Yes, we can voice our opinions about something else in everything. However, I didn't mean to be aggressive or offending anyone with that tweet whatsoever. I also want you to send this post to the HRs. Especially, to Bonnie because I don't know his Discord since for whatever reason it disappeared. I appreciate everything in Bloxton, I appreciate the members, and especially for everything I've accomplished along with forming friendship with others as well. I am thankful by today's standards to still have those who still support me to continue supporting me. I am not here treating anyone trash or pointing out that he or she is trash. All I am voicing, is my opinions like someone would do. Yes, someone will have criticism about it. But I didn't expect that this tweet what offend a lot of you. I understand, I will take the responsibility fore-granted. Because it was my mistake, and I should've noticed about this in the first place. I went too much based on what the public was thinking about instead of thinking about reality. Overall, I hope you all understood to what I said so far. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to DM me. Thank you! -Jackovation

best hr


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack the key is knowing when to play the bitch versus the dumb blonde


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
with cinder you play the dumb blonde bc he doesnt care if you're the bitch


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
"omg how does this exploit work that's so wild"


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
"pretty please never do that again"


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
like less dumb than that


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
but you get the point


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
so i act like a dumb person in front of him


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
great tactic


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
act like a harriet


[02-Mar-20 11:01 PM] emma;#1525
no you just dont scream at him


[02-Mar-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525
and be like "You better tell me who you are"


[02-Mar-20 11:02 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
so basically act like a teenage girl


[02-Mar-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525
because he gives 0 fucks


[02-Mar-20 11:02 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[02-Mar-20 11:02 PM] emma;#1525

holly told me that she could vouch for a 13 day old account at trainings then i told her it doesnt matter whether she vouches or not, its the standard procedure to ask for their main and ask them to send me a friend request on their main


[03-Mar-20 06:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then her friend said she got scolding because of her sister


[03-Mar-20 06:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

Both accounts were fired at the hotel


[03-Mar-20 07:25 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I probably didn't ban them from the TC and IC which lead to them receiving the rank again


[03-Mar-20 07:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i need to be trained on how to deal with ppl like him

If she can’t get her acc back omg all her hard work to become a Stapleton game mod and post instructor


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
I was legit on Stapleton with her a few hours ago before this happens


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] emma;#1525
Will they not rank an alt for her


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] emma;#1525

[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] emma;#1525
Like that’s not her fault


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
And there was these exploiters that kept joining and her banned them all. It was like a raid


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
And I guess they wanted revenge


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
And I hope so


[03-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
If she makes a new acc I’ll legit give her 2k to get stuff


[03-Mar-20 09:55 AM] stacey#1000
I know the sunglasses alone she liked to wear all the time were 900 robux

[03-Mar-20 10:09 AM] Polk#1596
It’s finally time for this to be addressed.
Jemma’s account got compromised on ROBLOX and Trello as well. So, If you are to check the POST roblox group you possibly might have a new role in the group.  
- - - - 
Please make sure you have 2-FA on ROBLOX and Trello because it could happen to you, you never know.
- - - - 
Our trello boards for POST were messed with except the POST Certification board don’t worry. 
This is was you should also have copies of your boards just in case something happens. 
- - - - 
Have a good day, everyone.


[03-Mar-20 10:10 AM] Polk#1596
The hacker basically ruined all of the trello boards for POST and accepted a ton of join requests


[03-Mar-20 10:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

Should be obvious ..?


[03-Mar-20 04:51 PM] Polk#1596
Does holly have an idea of who it might be


[03-Mar-20 04:51 PM] Polk#1596

It’s different in the uk .-.


[03-Mar-20 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
even in the uk


[03-Mar-20 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
its higher then 16


[03-Mar-20 05:03 PM] a. ღ#4222
I don’t think that’s really the most important thing rn


[03-Mar-20 05:03 PM] a. ღ#4222
That has all her fucking info


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
has anyone asked her if it is all correct


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
then if it is then it was a real dox


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
if not then it was a fake


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
because you can get most of that info with just the persons real name or email adress


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
because with the email, you can find what accounts are linked to it


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
and if an instagram is linked


[03-Mar-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003
you can see images like those


[03-Mar-20 05:05 PM] ethan;#0003

"imagine being such a horrible person to make fun of someone else, when the only thing that's ugly here are your motives and your personality. who the fuck makes fun of someone who is depressed when im SURE youve been depressed before. i dont care if you hate her, i dont care if you dislike her, there is no excuses for what you did. karma will definitely come back and hit you right in the fucking face for what u do. because guess what?? consequences have actions and theres a sweet treat in store for you down the road. holly is a beautiful person, inside and out. unlike you, get out from under the god damn bridge you troll, bc youre going to have to come out eventually and stop hanging out with all the other roaches down there. when life gets tough down the road, no one else will be there to pick you up. why? because you're supposed to treat others how u want to be treated. and u certainly arent treating anyone fairly or kindly. c:"

walk in da house


[03-Mar-20 07:23 PM] ethan;#0003
can we make a rule that for a staff to be reported for working in the wrong station, they need to be asked to work in the correct station, and in the poof they need to have a picture of you asking them to work at the correct station and a picture of them refusing


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
because i fell like the staff who get reported for it, they arent even told to go back to the correct station


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
and then have no idea why they got suspended


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah that should be a rule


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
because most of the time, the only proof is them standing at like the bar


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i really dislike that happening


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] ethan;#0003
when they are a receptionsit


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if i may


[03-Mar-20 07:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i can basically make an announcement regarding it


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
more than likely


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
i feel like there are a few things


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll just run a vote


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
that they need to remind them about


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
before reporting them


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
Like if they spin on a segway


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
They should be reminded


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
not to do that


[03-Mar-20 07:26 PM] ethan;#0003
and if they do it again THEN report it


[03-Mar-20 07:27 PM] ethan;#0003
@xAfroTrey i will tag here for a vote


[03-Mar-20 07:28 PM] ethan;#0003
@High Rank Vote on above what I said. I feel like too many staff are being reported for something they didn't even know was not allowed and not even being told they cant do it

[03-Mar-20 07:29 PM] ethan;#0003
in staff announcements?


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] ethan;#0003
or normal


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
uhhhh


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Normal.


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
maybe one for everyone and a different one for MRs?


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if u wanna give MRs more detail if not everyone should be fine


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] ethan;#0003
ya


[03-Mar-20 07:30 PM] ethan;#0003
probaly one for each


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think there's a point putting it on two channels.


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] ethan;#0003
the one in staff announcments should be more detail


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] ethan;#0003
like explaining what reports to accept


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] ethan;#0003
and what not


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
One is basically fine since it's for everyone.


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] ethan;#0003
and the one in normal is like who to report and who not to report


[03-Mar-20 07:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's just me though.


[03-Mar-20 07:33 PM] ethan;#0003
ok ill make the announcement


[03-Mar-20 07:33 PM] ethan;#0003

:bloxton3: **Reporting staff members working in unauthorized stations** :bloxton3: 

            Greetings members and guests of Bloxton Hotels! 

             It has come to the HR teams attention that an increase in the amount of staff members at Bloxton Hotels are being reported for working at a station they are unauthorized to work at. When reporting a staff member, you should be reminding them that they should not be working at that station without permission from an MR or higher. If there's no members from the MR Team around in the server, they cannot work at a station with a different position.
              The **INCORRECT** way to report a staff member who is not working at their authorized staton is if you ONLY take a picture of them standing and or working at that station, without you or another staff member asking them to please stop and return to their mandated station or the person is refusing to return to their mandated station. 
              The **CORRECT** way to report a staff member who is not working at their authorized station is to take three photos and or one video of the staff member working at the 
unauthorized station, of the staff being told to go back to their correct station, and of the staff refusing to go back to their mandated station. 
                **PLEASE NOTE** that you DO NOT report someone if they comply with you and go back to their designated station, you ONLY report if they REFUSE.


**Signed,**

@xAfroTrey is this good


[03-Mar-20 07:53 PM] ethan;#0003
can you read it for mistakes


[03-Mar-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
change "reporting such staff member" to "reporting a staff member"


[03-Mar-20 07:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
im going to look for more


[03-Mar-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so change "you should be reminding the staff member that they should not be working at that station without permission from an MR+ (Rank 8+), if no MR’s are in the server, they can not work at a station other than the one for their rank!"


[03-Mar-20 07:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
to


[03-Mar-20 07:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"you should be reminding them that they should not be working at that station without permission from an MR or higher. If there's no members from the MR Team around in the server, they cannot work at a station with a different position."


[03-Mar-20 07:57 PM] ethan;#0003

The **CORRECT** way to report a staff member who is not working at their authorized station is to take three photos and or one video of the staff member working at the unauthorized station, the user itself being told to go back to their correct station, and of the staff refusing to go back to the station of their position.

**PLEASE NOTE** that you DO NOT report someone if they comply with you and go back to their designated station, you ONLY report if they **REFUSE.**


[03-Mar-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[03-Mar-20 08:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think it's scaling differences most likely


[03-Mar-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003

[03-Mar-20 08:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[03-Mar-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
the only reason lced had her exploits was because her dad coded it for her


[03-Mar-20 10:18 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

that is so fucking immature


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
she could have them turned off but you know that’s why


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
I’m almost positive that we were friends on disc


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
Bc we’ve been in gcs that we’ve added each other to


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i cant send her fren request too


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
ok so ig she turned them all off


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525

[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
its like some immature kid


[03-Mar-20 11:48 PM] emma;#1525
She thinks she’s being promoted any time soon??


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
she thinks she still rules


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
Tagging her in her disc admin chat and telling her to open DMs lol


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
and i oop


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bruhhhh watcch her be like


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
no


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
She doesn’t get to act like this


[03-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
First she doesn’t even recognize she did anything wrong


[03-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
Acts like Slee wasn’t involved and they didn’t gang up on void


[03-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
Then tries to guilt me by saying “next time I’ll be quiet” when I clearly told her that the best way to handle it is letting us know so we can deal with it


[03-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
She’s such a fucking victim god and it’s not even all guests fault Bc she did this before him too


[03-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
This is why I didn’t want her back


[03-Mar-20 11:51 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ngl i think they both deserve a written warning


[03-Mar-20 11:51 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
at least a warning


[03-Mar-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
I gave her a warning


[03-Mar-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
If she’s reacting this poorly to it that means she doesn’t get what she did


[03-Mar-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
Which could warrant a suspension in my opinion


[03-Mar-20 11:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
no remorse


[03-Mar-20 11:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
means shes probs gonna do it with slee again


[03-Mar-20 11:52 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
did slee get sent yet


[03-Mar-20 11:53 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause if saab reacts like this but slee reacts good then uh bye saab foreva


[03-Mar-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
No idea


[03-Mar-20 11:53 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i dont think min warned slee when he dmed him


[03-Mar-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
lowkey voted for Tate to get a promo bc I want to see Slee and Saab’s reactions when they DONT get promoted bc of this


[03-Mar-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525

[03-Mar-20 11:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[03-Mar-20 11:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[03-Mar-20 11:58 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
he also is chill ye


[03-Mar-20 11:58 PM] emma;#1525
nah tate doesn’t get drawn into that crap


[03-Mar-20 11:59 PM] emma;#1525
Which is funny bc I think he’s the youngest of the three


[03-Mar-20 11:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye hes acting more like saab's age than saab


[04-Mar-20 12:15 AM] ¢. ღ#0666

And MRs can not find his username.
At all.


[04-Mar-20 07:45 AM] Cooqkie#2809
Even if they view the entire player list?


[04-Mar-20 07:46 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

They can navigate who it is


[04-Mar-20 08:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even if the view command was missing, they can find who it is just by clicking users


[04-Mar-20 08:21 AM] bman#0435
how would jx_sy know what the mrs’ abilities r lol


[04-Mar-20 08:21 AM] bman#0435

[04-Mar-20 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
@emma; omg if Tate gets one more vote and approval to promote do you want to actually be the one to promote him and sees Saab reaction even more to that. Idc if you steal my promotion for him

[04-Mar-20 11:11 AM] stacey#1000
Now idc if I promote him but I feel like it would be more funny if you did Emma. To tick Saab off and see if she acts immature over it @emma;


[04-Mar-20 11:11 AM] a. ღ#4222

[04-Mar-20 11:12 AM] stacey#1000
And I really want to promote him still but still feel like it would be funnier if Emma did


[04-Mar-20 11:12 AM] stacey#1000

[04-Mar-20 11:17 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I voted for him


[04-Mar-20 11:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Out of all three, he is the most mature


[04-Mar-20 11:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Kind of sad that he's younger and acts a lot more proper than both of them

xParkk09/04/2017
Well, Emma asked me if she could play "Emma says". That was a part of it. If it's considered "AA" I won't let her anymore. And I'm not sure if Trey should be involved due to it being Emma's game.


[04-Mar-20 11:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ahahah wtf


[04-Mar-20 11:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Strxw_Berry09/04/2017
Yes, mostly beccause she has embarassed herself and Trey on YoutTube. Showing poor representation.

idk who


[04-Mar-20 01:34 PM] stacey#1000
wants to resign over this too


[04-Mar-20 01:34 PM] stacey#1000
trip.Today at 2:26 PM
Alright, so.
I'm very extremely upset, my best friend is very upset and wanting to resign because of reports. It's not because she can't do them but it's because some of the rules don't make sense and HRs say different and there is no set thing, reports are constantly changing and the way we do them. If you look in ML, there is a stupid debate going off and such, I HATE doing my job in such an environment where, I don't know what to tick for reports or deny. 

New managers are sure to be confused and I know some seniors told me to accept things and so on. I've always ticked major spamming reports if it's two big paragraphs, as for little ones, it is usually 3-4+. However, Lyoo denys this. Sabrina has different thoughs and then Polk told Lyoo something and all this, it's a very confusing conversation for me to understand but when my friend is extremely upset to the point they WANT to resign, I think something needs to be done. HRs really need to talk about problems in the company otherwise it will just be not fun for anyone at all. I love this job so much and I love everyone here, but if something I can't function properly doesn't work and all that, it upsets me. I don't want my friend to be upset over a little thing.
>Adding on, there was a thing about 2 months ago or so about a sheet thing that would let MRs discuss their issues about the place or whatever so they can fix it. NOTHING was done. I asked Katie about this as well about a month ago, nothing was done. I'm upset that the HR team is ignoring this. I don't know if they are necessarily ignoring but it is upsetting when I want to love this job and really dedicate my 100% self to it.

word


[04-Mar-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank So, Trippy messaged me and was basically stating her concerns on how some managers don't understand what and what is not reportable or something (Idek really myself im confused on it) Then she was stating about how like 2 months ago we had that google form thing made for MRs to address their concerns then how they never heard anything after it or nothing was done. You can let me know what you all think about what we should do. Here is the conversation I had with her.

[04-Mar-20 02:09 PM] stacey#1000
I think maybe just an announcement to clarify what is and not reportable might benefit, as managers do hear different answers all the time on if a report should be accepted or not.


[04-Mar-20 02:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
some managers think they should decline a report with valid proof but incorrect format


[04-Mar-20 02:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I think as long as the proof is valid they should accept it but warn for incorrect format


[04-Mar-20 02:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
then it wouldn't be counted towards a kick


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; boi y u say yes


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] bman#0435
u said it sounds like cap


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] bman#0435
then say yes


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] Polk#1596

[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] Polk#1596
lyoo asked me


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] Polk#1596
basically if u get a report of the same thing


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] Polk#1596
and one person sent invalid evidence


[04-Mar-20 02:15 PM] Polk#1596
while the other one provided valid evidence


[04-Mar-20 02:16 PM] Polk#1596
what is so confusing about that?


[04-Mar-20 02:16 PM] bman#0435

@Polk his understanding makes no sense


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
well i didnt understand the question at all


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
so i said


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
"did that answer ur question?"


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
and he said yes


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
so idk


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] ethan;#0003
fuckkk why do people still get mod and kick all


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
woo bman u did it!


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
ethan


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
listen


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
all of you


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
need to do


[04-Mar-20 02:18 PM] Polk#1596
:joinlogs


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
write every single MR


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
after u have slocked


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
and see if theres some people trying to get mod


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ethan;#0003
that takes too much extra time


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ethan;#0003
it its like 10 mrs


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
ethan


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ethan;#0003
the mrs should notice


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
it doesnt take any longer than it takes to mod them


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ethan;#0003
they go afk for 40 minuites


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ethan;#0003
just standing there


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] bman#0435
its not the mrs job to mod tho


[04-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
well ethan, it is your responsibility since you are modding


[04-Mar-20 02:20 PM] bman#0435
nooby noob


[04-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
it used to happen to me so much


[04-Mar-20 02:20 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah ik


[04-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
so i started using joinlogs and it worked perfectly


[04-Mar-20 02:20 PM] ethan;#0003
sometimes the mrs notice, but never say anything


[04-Mar-20 02:20 PM] ethan;#0003
until after everyone gets kicked


[04-Mar-20 02:21 PM] Polk#1596
oh, hm


[04-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ethan;#0003
like thats what i meant


[04-Mar-20 02:21 PM] Polk#1596
then i understand what u mean, since they are supposed to tell u things like that


[04-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[04-Mar-20 02:22 PM] ethan;#0003
the person said the only reason they did it was to see the reaction the mrs had


[04-Mar-20 02:22 PM] ethan;#0003
if we tell the mrs not to react


[04-Mar-20 02:22 PM] ethan;#0003
then they will just stop


[04-Mar-20 02:22 PM] ethan;#0003
because they did like 10 dots


[04-Mar-20 02:23 PM] ethan;#0003
thats with most of the CB's


[04-Mar-20 02:23 PM] ethan;#0003
they just want a reaction


[04-Mar-20 02:23 PM] ethan;#0003
if they are ignored, they leave


[04-Mar-20 02:24 PM] Polk#1596
thats exactly why i ignore every CB


[04-Mar-20 02:24 PM] Polk#1596
they hate me but i dont care about being popular amongst the CBs


[04-Mar-20 02:24 PM] Polk#1596
they are just annoying


[04-Mar-20 02:26 PM] stacey#1000
so can I make an announcement for managers?


[04-Mar-20 02:26 PM] stacey#1000
about what I pinged for


[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
i like the announcement


[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
what if we made a new form for mangement


[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
and see what they want us to do


[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] Polk#1596
i dont understand what she is complaining about though


[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
because they NEVER speak out


[04-Mar-20 02:28 PM] Polk#1596
i dont understand anything


[04-Mar-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
yeah lets do that


[04-Mar-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
shes comaplaining about how managers hear things different from seniors or hrs about to decline or accept a report


[04-Mar-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
like for major spamming


[04-Mar-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
for example


[04-Mar-20 02:30 PM] bman#0435
i dont know what they expect us to do when literally trip is the only one speaking out abt it


[04-Mar-20 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
lets make a google form for managers


[04-Mar-20 02:30 PM] bman#0435
honestly she is the only one id be considering for a senior position alongside june


[04-Mar-20 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
only


[04-Mar-20 02:31 PM] Polk#1596
? This isn't because we don't know, it's just because they get confusing and someone posts major spamming with two big sentences, it gets denied. Why? Then someone posts another photo with 3 and it gets accepted, it makes no sense. I was told by a senior that it was fine.


[04-Mar-20 02:31 PM] Polk#1596
i thought it was pretty clear


[04-Mar-20 02:31 PM] Polk#1596
major spamming = chat being flooded


[04-Mar-20 02:33 PM] bman#0435
@High Rank make a google form for management to fill out for what we can do to help them? i mean they still complain to how we dont meet their standards, yet they never speak out about anything

His time with Bloxton is over, so anticipate him saying that he was "unfairly treated." @ethan;


[04-Mar-20 03:45 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
kenzi, omer, daisy, biatrice, lily, south, sarah, alyssa, and sabrina


[04-Mar-20 03:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No way it was Kenzi.


[04-Mar-20 03:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
South seems like my biggest suspect.

[04-Mar-20 04:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah after finding one mrs tiktok account it led to them finding more on other mrs


[04-Mar-20 04:05 PM] bman#0435
because shes having like a midlife crisis rn


[04-Mar-20 04:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so a lot more are at risk rn


[04-Mar-20 04:05 PM] bman#0435
even though she isnt even at midlife age


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah they rly need to be careful here...


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525

[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
or real offline


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
do we know


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she was dming me while she was offline


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
also should we announce to MRs that they arent allowed to give out private info in SL


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so shes fake offline


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
or is that too obvious


[04-Mar-20 04:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
YES


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
a lot of mrs are at risk rn with having their private info up on tiktok


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
wait so if she posted it in SL


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
and Iced found it


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
does that mean someone leaked SL


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
or


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and then that led to them finding more info


[04-Mar-20 04:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
on her and other mrs


[04-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525

Greetings Management team!

The HRs have seen a lot of confusion recently with the rules and regulations, and have decided to open up a form to have you introduce to us some topics you would like us to clarify or give you guys a better understanding of. The form is limitless, meaning you can send it as many as you would like but they must be appropriate or relevant. However, if we get troll submissions, they will be investigated and the person will receive indefinite consequences. The HRs appreciate every response we could get, so please take a little time out of your day to not only help us out but help yourselves out! https://forms.gle/mbpgrgkYwMfkxYSk6

hadley resigned because she doxxed and didnt want consequences...


[04-Mar-20 04:09 PM] bman#0435

[04-Mar-20 04:10 PM] bman#0435

[04-Mar-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525

[04-Mar-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
thats like saying we cant investigate the holly situation because we dont have the name of who doxxed


[04-Mar-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435

um hold on so


[04-Mar-20 04:40 PM] bman#0435
well if she deleted it yesterday and they made the collage the same day then her deleting it after she got doxxed doesnt do much


[04-Mar-20 04:40 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

@High Rank Be warned, someone is trying to get cam_s falsely fired with evidence that is clearly photo shopped. I was contacted by a user who just created the discord account today and right away I could tell it was false evidence. I will be banning this user permanently from the discord server, and yes I already contacted cam regarding this, informing him I was not falling for it. He was literally at work, not even on ROBLOX when this claims were mad. If anyone messages you with false evidence like this, just be alert and don't fall for this fake evidence. I honestly had a good laugh when I first saw it.

Sure, tell me that all you want, but I already know this statement is fake. Legit, it's not hard to tell. I have spoken to cam himself regarding this, and he was even offline when you made this statement. I suggest you be truthful, as you are about to face a permanent ban from the discord server for creating false evidence.

Sure, tell me that all you want, but I already know this statement is fake. Legit, it's not hard to tell. I have spoken to cam himself regarding this, and he was even offline when you made this statement. I suggest you be truthful, as you are about to face a permanent ban from the discord server for creating false evidence.

this guy told me


[05-Mar-20 01:31 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he got the blacklist role before the warning announcement was maded


[05-Mar-20 01:32 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
so he still wants to appeal his warning and turn the blacklist role to a warning instead


[05-Mar-20 01:36 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
@bonnie591 when does a ticket blacklist get lifted


[05-Mar-20 01:40 AM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Mar-20 01:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
or he


[05-Mar-20 01:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

ive already told ra1n that


[05-Mar-20 01:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
and if she wants to be more annoying i can restart the 90 days


[05-Mar-20 01:42 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he said he found it unfair


[05-Mar-20 01:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
or she


[05-Mar-20 01:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
well i dont care


[05-Mar-20 01:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
that it was a blacklist before the announcement


[05-Mar-20 01:43 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
but turned into a warning now


[05-Mar-20 01:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
she was the fucking definition of impatient


[05-Mar-20 01:43 AM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Everyone thinks she is alloe


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
You all want to rig awards so she can’t win


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Blacklist her from promos


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Etc


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
But not fire her???


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Amie


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Now alloe


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
I need sleep


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause its speculation


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Exactly


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
so idk


[05-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
We’re punishing her bc we have no proof


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
But because Bman and a few others are dead set


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
Everyone believes it


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
That’s just... really not okay in my opinion


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
i think they just need to check amiee's main inventory


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
ive said that before


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
I told you guys to get more proof on her


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
Or else I’m either firing or promoting


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
ive said its not fair to assume things of alloe with no real proof


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bman did


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause alloe's limited went to someone


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
we told her to open her inventory


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
but ttheir inventory is closed


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but


[05-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
when she opened it


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
thats not real proof


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
no one has ever reported her to us


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she traded her limiteds to someone who


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
is private


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
or deleted


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
that doesnt mean shes a cb tho


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
or just promote her and let her


[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[05-Mar-20 12:23 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 did train get nominated


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
And they are both bullies


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
dont talk to me abt train


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] ethan;#0003
Cyto for best former hr


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
its impossible for train to be nominated since we didnt do nominations for former hr


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
now heres the thing


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think train should be eligible


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] ethan;#0003
Why not?


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525
he was going to be fired for account sharing


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525
which he'd been doing for a long ass time


[05-Mar-20 01:32 PM] ethan;#0003
Nobody knows what happened except for us


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
and then left before an investigation could be launced


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
that's despicable


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ethan


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
ethan its not like we're publicizing it


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
im pretty sure train wont win


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525
i hope not


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think a lot of people know abt train tho


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
and its gonna be suspicious if we dont


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] ethan;#0003
Oh I thought he said he account shared once when he met ester irl and let her use his phone


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
hes honor member


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They were going all out


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
so people think its a normal resignation


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
In general


[05-Mar-20 01:33 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[05-Mar-20 01:34 PM] emma;#1525

[05-Mar-20 01:34 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[05-Mar-20 01:34 PM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Mar-20 04:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Totally


[05-Mar-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
ok so bri aka xbrianna_7 got in trouble because she didnt meet her mom's expectations in school, basically she got a C in a class, and so her mom is taking everything away from her and is possibly making her move to her dads house, who isnt a good person, but bri has no one to go to because her grandparents took her college funds away, her mom is being toxic and telling her that she is a disappointment, and her dad is a terrible person


[05-Mar-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll be her parent


[05-Mar-20 04:14 PM] bman#0435
i told her to get professional help from someone or to call someone to help her like her guidance counselor but her school doesnt have a guidance counselor for some reason and her mom cut off her communication for everything


[05-Mar-20 04:14 PM] bman#0435
and she was on vc with me just now telling me all of this and she was crying and im just so sad now


[05-Mar-20 04:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I take great care of the kids no cap 😤


[05-Mar-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Jokes aside that sounds sad af


[05-Mar-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
@bman does her dad even have custody


[05-Mar-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
her mom cant just send her off to her dads


[05-Mar-20 04:15 PM] bman#0435
idk


[05-Mar-20 04:16 PM] bman#0435
and its like i messaged her but she doesnt have enough time to even type much back because she doesnt want to disappoint her parents even more


[05-Mar-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She sounds like she has an awful family


[05-Mar-20 04:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hope she's aight


[05-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
ya


[05-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
thats y i want her to get professional hekp


[05-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
help


[05-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
or even call 911


[05-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
if her mom verbally abuses her


[05-Mar-20 04:20 PM] Polk#1596
I remember when she resigned I was on a VC with her and she had a legit mental breakdown and i didnt know how to deal with it since it was only me


[05-Mar-20 04:20 PM] bman#0435
and now shes offline D:


[05-Mar-20 04:20 PM] Polk#1596
It was when her parents made her delete roblox, discord and everything


[05-Mar-20 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
Sad to see her still having that relationship with her parents


[05-Mar-20 04:21 PM] bman#0435
ya because she "downloaded a virus"


[05-Mar-20 04:21 PM] Polk#1596

[05-Mar-20 04:21 PM] Polk#1596

@xAfroTrey  what is she upset about I’m confused


[06-Mar-20 10:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so there's a couple of things she mentioned


[06-Mar-20 10:58 AM] emma;#1525
is she upset that we don’t pass people bc of account age


[06-Mar-20 10:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
1) users being reported for CB without really any traces of chatlogs and such


[06-Mar-20 10:58 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm what else


[06-Mar-20 10:59 AM] emma;#1525

hmm there's chatboxes they can use


[06-Mar-20 11:00 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
im going to look at other things she pointed out


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] emma;#1525
chat boxes time out pretty fast


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think she's i guess upset about mack not handling the interviewee the bman way?


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] emma;#1525
Also CBS don’t always tak


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] emma;#1525

[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] emma;#1525
If she doesn’t like it she can quit


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
this is honestly quite confusing


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] emma;#1525
I mean we’ve had so many cb issues


[06-Mar-20 11:01 AM] emma;#1525
The MRs should understand why we’re so cautious

[06-Mar-20 05:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
we shouldnt just keep an ally if clearly we arent acting like allies towards each other


[06-Mar-20 05:09 PM] bman#0435
they clearly dont dont deserve our respect and we dont deseve theirs either


[06-Mar-20 05:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
because if we're gonna get rid of them i want more stuff on them


[06-Mar-20 05:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
i dont want them saying we're unloyal


[06-Mar-20 05:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
but they are the unloyal ones

[06-Mar-20 05:19 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Mar-20 05:19 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Mar-20 05:20 PM] ethan;#0003

[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] bman#0435
like u cant do trolling trolling trolling


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
huh


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
why not


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
theres no rule for it


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] bman#0435
thats what ive been told before


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i would do dat


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah why not lol


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] xM_inn#2821
if somebody is trolling then ppl should be able to warn for that reason


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] Cooqkie#2809
isnt it the same thing as saying continuing


[07-Mar-20 09:46 AM] bman#0435
that we cwnt use the same warning all 3 tjmes


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
ya


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
i do remember it being something back in early 2018


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
but it kinda dissolved


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] bman#0435
i was told to say continuing or refusal if they ckntinue


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
and nobody cared


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] bman#0435
not to say the same thing


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
the only time its an issue is


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
LOL


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
if they warn for trolling


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
and like


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
10 seconds later


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
they warn for trolling again


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
i dont think its a big problem to warn someone three times for the same reason so i say we allow it


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Polk#1596
thats a dumb rule


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
ya


[07-Mar-20 09:47 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] Polk#1596
if someone spams and then spam again are u supposed to just let them spam since u already warned them for the same thing..? like theres no logic in that


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
i'd rather not confuse staff by having to make them think of separate reasons to warn someone


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but we cuff for spamming


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] Polk#1596
no cookie


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] Polk#1596
we cuff for major spam


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] ¢. ღ#0666
should there be an announcement regarding it since a lot of people think they can't warn for the same reason


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[07-Mar-20 09:48 AM] bman#0435

[07-Mar-20 10:27 AM] emma;#1525
like f||ri||ck


[07-Mar-20 10:27 AM] emma;#1525

I lowkey think we should fire her


[07-Mar-20 12:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like apart of me thinks she's definitely doing this on purpose


[07-Mar-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She knows she's not supposed to answer questions and it makes her look really bad for the company


[07-Mar-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You don't see any of the heads do this sort of thing, like ever.


[07-Mar-20 12:30 PM] bman#0435

[07-Mar-20 12:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-Mar-20 12:38 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey not enough to fire her


[07-Mar-20 12:38 PM] emma;#1525

[07-Mar-20 12:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I dunno emma


[07-Mar-20 12:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It feels like she's repeating the same thing all over again


[07-Mar-20 12:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If she starts lying to you, then that's fucked @emma;


[07-Mar-20 12:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then again


[07-Mar-20 12:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You're used to it so uhh

@everyone I want to do something special this award ceremony, but I can't do it alone!

I **NEED** pictures of **ALL MEMORIES** *thus* far, this could be anything FROM **V1-V6**, **ANYTHING** from before 1 Million members. It could be a solo picture, it could be a group picture, HR group pic before a new version, or even just a training pic with MRs! Try to include variety, and  try to just not do pictures of yourself. I want the images you give me to represent Bloxton **AS A WHOLE**, the **ENTIRE COMMUNITY**!

All of you are to search for pictures of Bloxton memories, and you can even ask some old MR friends who've been with us for a long time for help!

You are all to come together and send me a massive list of ~100 pictures to start with! **(100 in total, so come together and decide as a group what to submit to me)** Remember, *VARIETY* is key!

I'll have @bonnie591 create the document for you guys and upload the photos you decide on. I'll then review it, and you guys will upload them as decals once approved and send me another list with all the decal ids!

[07-Mar-20 02:58 PM] ethan;#0003
if we ask MR's they will think pictures from 2019 are old


[07-Mar-20 02:58 PM] ethan;#0003

[07-Mar-20 02:58 PM] babymariobebe#7563

I honestly would love to host two but like


[07-Mar-20 04:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it's a general manager thing


[07-Mar-20 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
Hosting two is just way too much


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
emma hosted two as a shift be4


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
I thought we needed permission from BOD


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000

[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
ive asked bonnie once


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
if i could host two


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because katie told her to


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000

[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

like 4+ trainees


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i could be wrong


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] Polk#1596
we cant host two servers


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
anything less than that not worth the stress of hosting two


[07-Mar-20 04:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[07-Mar-20 04:41 PM] Polk#1596
if you want another server to be hosted, you need either a senior or another HR to host it


[07-Mar-20 04:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
whats not an actual thing


[07-Mar-20 04:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[08-Mar-20 07:21 AM] stacey#1000
I still dk if I should apply for post in a few weeks when V3 is out


[08-Mar-20 07:21 AM] stacey#1000
Like I want to but don’t


[08-Mar-20 07:21 AM] stacey#1000
Pros and cons


[08-Mar-20 07:21 AM] stacey#1000
Tell me why I should apply for post


[08-Mar-20 08:00 AM] Polk#1596
To be honest stacey, criminal is fun and everything. But you really dont know how fun it is to be a cop before you try it! Like in FSP, you can legally shoot people if they have a gun, drive into people in pursuits, etc and it usually happens all the time!! So like, theres usually always something happening. From my own experience, I got addicted to stapleton really quickly just being a correctional officer and stuff dont happen there extremely often. Getting a job takes time, but its a lot of fun once you graduate POST and get accepted into a department you know you will enjoy


[08-Mar-20 08:00 AM] Polk#1596
And like


[08-Mar-20 08:01 AM] Polk#1596
if you ever stop liking being a cop


[08-Mar-20 08:01 AM] Polk#1596
u can just resign and go criminal


[08-Mar-20 08:01 AM] Polk#1596
@stacey


[08-Mar-20 08:02 AM] Polk#1596
Oh and most importantly, you get to hang out with me, min, bonnie and ethan


[08-Mar-20 08:02 AM] Polk#1596
idk if ethan is going to do POST tho


[08-Mar-20 08:51 AM] stacey#1000
Okay I’ll apply for post in V3 but I’ll be asking you for help probably. I tried it on my alt and quit after tier 1. Mostly cause it was an alt and I didn’t like going back and forth. Also I want to bug Jemma and she would be one of my post instructors @Polk


[08-Mar-20 08:53 AM] stacey#1000
I can just be criminal on my alt


[08-Mar-20 08:53 AM] stacey#1000
But that’s not allowed is it


[08-Mar-20 08:58 AM] Polk#1596
yes, i'll help you!


[08-Mar-20 08:58 AM] Polk#1596
i mean you can, but like if they find out


[08-Mar-20 08:58 AM] Polk#1596
ur dead meat


[08-Mar-20 08:58 AM] Polk#1596
the thing is


[08-Mar-20 08:59 AM] Polk#1596
that POST class is going to be supeerr big


[08-Mar-20 08:59 AM] Polk#1596
you can still do it, but its going to take way longer due to the large amount of players in every tier


[08-Mar-20 08:59 AM] stacey#1000
I don’t like long trainings


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Another reason why I quit on my alt acc


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] Polk#1596
well, one of them lasts up to 3-4 hours


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
I could’ve been dot and post certified by now


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I know


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] Polk#1596
im not a big fan of it either


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
The tier 1 I did with minn


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Was 3 hours


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] stacey#1000
Haha yes I was at Minns tier 1


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] Polk#1596
but they host multiple tiers, so you can always do like tier 3 one week after you get to tier 2 so theres not that many people there


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] Polk#1596
:O


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] Polk#1596
oh tier 1


[08-Mar-20 09:00 AM] Polk#1596
tier 1 and tier 2 are just documents now i think


[08-Mar-20 09:01 AM] Polk#1596
its just tier 3 that is many hours long


[08-Mar-20 09:01 AM] Polk#1596
then tier 4 is like 1 hour


[08-Mar-20 09:01 AM] Polk#1596
then tier 5 is 30 minutes


[08-Mar-20 09:01 AM] Polk#1596
then tier 6 is 1-2 hours


[08-Mar-20 09:01 AM] Polk#1596
it might have changed since POST makes like big changes every class

[08-Mar-20 09:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@High Rank Should freebugs receive the former MR role? Just asking at the moment since she was fired for leaking to Harriett. However, it took place on Dec 11th, 2019 according to the Trello card. Let me know your thoughts on this. I'll put some reactions below for your judgement.

{Reactions}
✅ ❌ (4) 

[08-Mar-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
I mean is she apologetic and understanding what she did was wrong


[08-Mar-20 10:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, I haven't heard a word about it.


[08-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey so she didn't even send in an appeal..?


[08-Mar-20 10:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, she just asked for the role on the ticket system.


[08-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
Trey you've been an HR for too long of a time to not make someone send in an appeal before we vote lol


[08-Mar-20 10:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, there are other points where we just ask similar to what I did.


[08-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
Not really...?


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Since when have we given a role without making someone appeal lol


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Emma, this literally happened numerous times, lol.


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
the whole point is to see if they are growing from their mistakes


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Name them then


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
If they've happened numerous times


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, let's see.


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Flyro was one of them.


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Tf


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Why did y'all do that


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
And when lmao


[08-Mar-20 10:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not sure who gave him the role.


[08-Mar-20 10:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know he's not here, I think.


[08-Mar-20 10:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
This was before he was disrespectful towards you. @emma;


[08-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
ok well we should be requiring everyone to submit appeals since that's what we tell them when they lose roles or get banned


[08-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
so pls have her send in an appeal lol


[08-Mar-20 10:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mk


[08-Mar-20 10:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@xAfroTrey what did free say to you


[08-Mar-20 10:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Anything about regretting their actions


[08-Mar-20 10:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I mean it was a few months ago


[08-Mar-20 10:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But hasn’t talked in server since 1/24 which is odd.


[08-Mar-20 10:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Not very active


[08-Mar-20 10:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No.


[08-Mar-20 10:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I just pinged her implying she needs to appeal first. Then, if it gets accepted or gets enough votes, I'll give her the role.


[08-Mar-20 10:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
December isn’t that long ago considering she leaked to a Bc


[08-Mar-20 10:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Cb*


[08-Mar-20 10:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
More time


[08-Mar-20 10:40 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Might change my mind if she sends an appeal though

The way he's handling it is like shooting someone and then saying

"It was just a prank I swear!!"


[09-Mar-20 07:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank Update on the situation with Addie and Void: Apparently Void was "joking" when he said he was on Addie's account.. both still remain terminated at the moment until I speak to Addie. They might be reinstated if they're proven to not of account shared after all, but I'll still probably suspend Void for joking around like that if they're reinstated. Stay tuned ig.

@xM_inn if addie and void didn’t acc share whoever lied about it should still stay fired for lying or at least have a 5 day suspension if they are getting their ranks back


[09-Mar-20 09:50 AM] stacey#1000
Because they shouldn’t joke about stuff like that


[09-Mar-20 09:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn noob why did you uncheck the banning session I hosted if it lasts two weeks on my checklist. I rechecked it


[09-Mar-20 09:54 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Faris is a major hinter tho


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
he always uses two dots when he speaks to me


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
USUALLY WHEN I'VE DONE SOMETHING


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] ethan;#0003
Faris doesn’t hint


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
I WAS TESTING OUT THE REVERBS


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
and he had the audacity


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] ethan;#0003
He is just super nice


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
to say


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
"Stop Min.."


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] ethan;#0003
So it looks like hinting


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xM_inn#2821

[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not a good thing lol


[09-Mar-20 12:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
HES ALWAYS SO HAPPY AROUND ME AND TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION LOL


[09-Mar-20 12:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[09-Mar-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Same here


[09-Mar-20 12:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It makes me a little uncomfortable


[09-Mar-20 12:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
whenever i post a promotion video with someone who has limiteds theres always that comment that says: "they only promote rich people"


[09-Mar-20 12:10 PM] xM_inn#2821
also this alex kid


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xM_inn#2821

hes using smiley faces


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They pretend Elijah doesn't exist lol


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xM_inn#2821

[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xM_inn#2821

[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
Alex is VoidLapiz


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i could tell that alex has an attitude just by seeing the screenshots


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hes just salty hes terminated


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
I always promote people without robux


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
and hes like not using grammar and using the smiley face when he answers my questions


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's gotta be blacklisted


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No dap


[09-Mar-20 12:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

My first promotion was Nikki


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ethan;#0003
“Mkay”


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
he tryna act like a hero


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
LMFAO


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ethan;#0003
Don’t act like a hero “mkay”


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
like bruh he caused it


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
m k a y


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
exactly


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ethan;#0003
Just blacklist him


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
hes the one who caused it in the first place


[09-Mar-20 12:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's making it worse on himself


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And his chances of an appeal seems like on thin ice atm


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn I vote we don’t keep void fired because you falsely fired him without even looking deeper into it


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] emma;#1525
So


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] emma;#1525
Maybe a suspension


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uh emma


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
i disagree


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
he wasnt entirely falsely fired


[09-Mar-20 12:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Scroll up


[09-Mar-20 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
and hes handled this poorly


[09-Mar-20 12:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's handling this like Cinder


[09-Mar-20 12:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I'm not liking it at all


[09-Mar-20 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
he probably is cinder

Protesting at the hotel?


[09-Mar-20 12:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He needs to get a grip.


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn stop pinging :(((


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] emma;#1525
Did void and Addie account share


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
if u look in the chatlogs above he literally had LRs asking him questions 24/7


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] emma;#1525
Did he account share


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He's gone for sure, I really hate his attitude with this one.


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] emma;#1525
DID HE ACCOUNT SHARE


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] emma;#1525
Someone say yes or no


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bonnie591 no!


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
im just confused at this point


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he did, he literally admitted it too.


[09-Mar-20 12:15 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn Did he account share


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey then Addie should remain fired too


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well if he account shared doesnt that mean addie did too


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
but y’all voted to keep her


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
I need to speak with Addie first to confirm that.


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
Which is biased af


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
Because he raised an objection.


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
But he still joked about it.


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn then why did we vote to bring Addie back


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He went from that to actually admitting hinself.


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
was that before he objected or something


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
We didn't....


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] ethan;#0003
There is no solid proof that either one of them account shared but there is more proof pointing that Alex did


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
I said she might be reinstated


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
**BUT I NEED TO SPEAK WITH HER**


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT LOL


[09-Mar-20 12:16 PM] emma;#1525
Why are we even voting without talking to her


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
The actual fuck


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
Yalll give me headaches


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I wanted Addie gone tbh-


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
I swear y’all jump the gun on everything


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
🤦🏼‍♀️


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She's going to make excuses.


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
you clearly didnt read the message properly


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
I did kind


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she always does trey LOL


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
Minn


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
“Addie is most likely going to be reinstated.”


[09-Mar-20 12:17 PM] emma;#1525
Was the first sentence


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525
Then nothing about talking to her


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
I was asking opinions on firing Void regardless of the outcome of this situation


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't want to reinstate Void


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
So I was asking what u think


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No fucking way.


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
We aren't talking about Addie yet


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well if they both account shared they both deserve to remain fired


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think we should keep him fired for being upset if YOU got trigger happy and fired him for something because you didn’t read your proof correctly


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525
Which you admitted to in our DMs lol


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
there was a screenshot of him supposedly on addie's account


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525
I say he could get a suspension for sure


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525
A long one


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok emma well with respect, 3 HRs think otherwise


[09-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Now he just blew that.


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
But if you falsely fired him that could warrant you being suspended and we all know that won’t happen


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
So calm down


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
Minn you messed up and you’re blaming it on void


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] ethan;#0003
WE NEED DISTRICT COURT JUDGE BONNIE FOR THIS


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
Potentially messed up


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] xM_inn#2821
No I'm not..


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
I hope you didn’t


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thing is.


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
But like


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can't ignore his attitude being awful with this one.


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
Void being upset that he was falsely fired is more than fair


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
His handling of it was NOT good


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
But it’s not like it’s unwarranted


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
🤷🏼‍♀️


[09-Mar-20 12:19 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn did you show Emma the proof you got


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah send the proof in here again


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok so we wanna keep an MR who went to the hotel to cause drama about his termination and admitted to starting a protest


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok cool


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but no Emma.


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t want HRs that fire people without getting the whole story


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] emma;#1525
But here we are Minn


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He should've been way more peaceful with this.


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] emma;#1525
You don’t always get what you want


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Hello we are turning to communism where Emma makes all the decisions


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
we're already in communism


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] emma;#1525
Do people disagree that this happened without enough proof and way too fast


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well, i see emma's point


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] emma;#1525
Am I wrong about that!?


[09-Mar-20 12:20 PM] emma;#1525
We should NEVER have to go back on a termination


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
That is our fault if we have to bc that means we didn’t do our jobs well


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn can you send the proof again


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
And we’re blaming void bc he got super upset


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think they should both stay gone.


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
I saw all of it ethan


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
Minn didn’t even look at it properly


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah, sometimes we take things a little too fast and sometimes we take things a little to slow when it comes to investigations


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
I want to see it again


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] ethan;#0003
I only saw it once


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
I had to point out parts of it that price void was most likely joking


[09-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
it’s on the investigation board


[09-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
But sure it’s communism because I have an idea that y’all don’t agree with


[09-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ethan;#0003
And the award for best fan art goes tooooooooo

[09-Mar-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435
i wouldve still loved to know we got that asleep


[09-Mar-20 12:23 PM] xM_inn#2821
and none of y'all used to be able to do investigations


[09-Mar-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435
WHY DID I SAY ASLEEP


[09-Mar-20 12:23 PM] bman#0435

[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] bman#0435
I DONT EVEN REMEMBER WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, that sounds confusing Minn.


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well we all look into things together and try to figure out the best outcome


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] bman#0435
it still would have been nice to get a ping saying we got the report


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Given how we've voted many times and gave our own feedback on previous cases.


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] emma;#1525
I just don’t remember a time when one person doing something alone ever resulted well


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah same


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
BMAN-


[09-Mar-20 12:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman stop


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think I’ve ever done an investigation alone bc ik i have my own biases


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] bman#0435
LMFOAOAOOAOA


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] xM_inn#2821

[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
COMPLAINT BOARD*


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait a minute Emma


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525
Addie and void were both just involved in drama so does that make it easier to fire them? Hell yeah


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525
But they probably didn’t deserve it


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] bman#0435
how did void even get that “screenshotl


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525
But bc we don’t like Addie and void was involved in drama it causes a bias


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
cytoxin 😍 @xM_inn


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525
Addie could have actually been at the training


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525
And sent it


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
thats what im wondering, thats why addie needed to be questioned first


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah


[09-Mar-20 12:25 PM] emma;#1525

[09-Mar-20 12:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
After Matt was fired lol


[09-Mar-20 12:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
we all make mistakes


[09-Mar-20 12:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And it was Cinder


[09-Mar-20 12:26 PM] emma;#1525

i was here for the aftermath of the cinder case, and i was a new HR, and he messaged me about it and i had no idea what to do


[09-Mar-20 12:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
**wears masks in roblox**
**complains when people comment saying its the corona virus**


[09-Mar-20 12:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He hates me just because I fired him


[09-Mar-20 12:27 PM] emma;#1525

jack is so thoughtful


[09-Mar-20 12:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even though he completely ignored that this was a group decision


[09-Mar-20 12:28 PM] bonnie591#0591

[09-Mar-20 12:28 PM] bonnie591#0591

[09-Mar-20 12:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

You forgot this is the same person that literally yelled at Ava for his GFX not being out yet @emma;


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
he tried to get ava fired bc she used a GFX that she made


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
And got HRs to agree with him


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
So


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
Sorry if I hated the HR team the whole time I was an MR


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How the fuck was he not suspended for that


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; Yes


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525

[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
That’s why trey


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
They threatened her with suspensions and terminations if she didn’t change it


[09-Mar-20 12:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[09-Mar-20 12:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

When addie is questioned lmk


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
That’s not what I asked minn


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
“I guess I’ll talk to Addie” okay


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
Kinda sounds like you’re annoyed at him


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
So I’m sure he was hurt by that


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
well tbh i am annoyed with him yes


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
he shouldn't be joking with account sharing


[09-Mar-20 12:32 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so far i think both of them should be re-instated but thats just my opinion until addie gets questioned


[09-Mar-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
It’s literally not that big of a deal, I’ve seen people do it before and can tell it’s a JOKE


[09-Mar-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
you also hadn’t seen the clearly sarcastic part when you sent that right


[09-Mar-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
I’d also like to know why the reporter cropped the images to be more damning


[09-Mar-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
They cropped out the part where he was joking to make it seem like he was admitting to it


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
Like that seems a bit malicious lol


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
omg hi emma


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
emma, thats what im trying to find out


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
I think both should be reinstated but be Void suspended for a few days


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
yes


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
agreed


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Since Addie legit did NOTHING


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
because he lied


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; didn’t you call me a communist bc I suggested that


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oop


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000
give them both ranks back but suspend void


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Emma you are a communist tho?!?!?


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] stacey#1000

[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
no y’all just agree with me


[09-Mar-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
That’s not my fault


[09-Mar-20 12:35 PM] ethan;#0003
Tbh I didn’t even see what you said @emma;


[09-Mar-20 12:35 PM] emma;#1525
the fact that you were against me and then after I said my side switched shows that I’m right and you disagree with me for fun 😭😭


[09-Mar-20 12:35 PM] emma;#1525
ok but anyways


[09-Mar-20 12:35 PM] emma;#1525

[09-Mar-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
And THEN y’all can fire me


[09-Mar-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
Except it’ll be a fake fire bc there’s no proof she’s a CB


[09-Mar-20 12:39 PM] emma;#1525
So you’ll have to bring me back


[09-Mar-20 12:40 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[09-Mar-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525
I say voids behavior isn’t that weird considering minn fired him without talking to Addie and completely missed part of the evidence that shows him clearly being sarcastic


[09-Mar-20 12:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
emma can we fire anyone in the next few hours without u or no


[09-Mar-20 12:41 PM] emma;#1525

[09-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
2) shes sus to EVERYONE


[09-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
3) i dont trust her


[09-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
4) ur underthinking this and just taking her video from  february 21 and believing it without any further questioning


[09-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
u can change a timezone on a computer


[09-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
u can also inspect it


[09-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
i dont trust her video


[09-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
and then her description makes it more sketchy saying dont attempt going ot those links since she already deleted it


[09-Mar-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
and if u think alloe deserves a chance then that means imag does too lol


[09-Mar-20 03:36 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; can i do it rn


[09-Mar-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[09-Mar-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
@bman id like to see concrete proof that alloe is amie


[09-Mar-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
Bc all you’ve provided us with is speculations and pretty distant correlations combined with your opinions


[09-Mar-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
Can you get some


[09-Mar-20 04:15 PM] emma;#1525
Also don’t compare imag and alloe bc those are totally different situations and you know it lol


[09-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
lol


[09-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
and i just want to investigate her further


[09-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
to get more evidence of her proving she isnt amiee


[09-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
because the video she sent makes me even more sus lmfao


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
@bman since you didn’t take the time to do it yourself here’s her location since alloe was dumb and didn’t fully block it out on her screen recording app

[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
Is Connecticut


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
Which is EST


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
So


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] ethan;#0003
she could of just changed her location


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] ethan;#0003
in settings


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
exactly


[09-Mar-20 04:18 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah she could have but we can’t guarantee she did


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] ethan;#0003
because why would someone randomly have a video of that


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
So that’s just speculation


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
shes not getting my vote regardless because she makes me very suspicous


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] ethan;#0003
showing their timezone


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
Bc everyone thinks she’s amie lol


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] ethan;#0003
that video was posted feb 21st


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah she sent it to me a while ago when I asked her about being amie


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[09-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
and again she couldve been on a trip because timezones change automatically


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
OMG


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
you can’t prove she was Bman


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] bman#0435
im just sus of her still so


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
Again all you have is speculation


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] bman#0435
i never said she was lmao


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
OMG


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
hi


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
And I’d be so happy if you got rewl proof


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
Real


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] bman#0435
i just suggested it


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] bman#0435
so would i lmao


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
Bc we don’t have any


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
If you can’t find any then we can’t keep punishing alloe for no reason


[09-Mar-20 04:20 PM] emma;#1525
Bc were “sus”


[09-Mar-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
We thought bear was iced and gave up on that pretty quickly even with decent evidence


[09-Mar-20 04:21 PM] bman#0435
wdym by punishing lmao


[09-Mar-20 04:21 PM] bman#0435
we arent punishing her at all


[09-Mar-20 04:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well, her votes were made void and we also stopped people from promoting her and some of us even stated in staff lounge that she's a cb


[09-Mar-20 04:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so yIKEs

@bman dude


[09-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
I’ve done that already


[09-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
On my alt


[09-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
Lmao


[09-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
My alt that is supposedly a know troller that amie has no reason to lie to


[09-Mar-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
what was ur full convo with her tho


[09-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
Exactly what yours will be lol


[09-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
Her saying she’s not amie and doesn’t know why everyone thinks it


[09-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
Different time zones


[09-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
She didn’t have her account when amie was there


[09-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
Etc


[09-Mar-20 05:04 PM] bman#0435
because she made her account the day amiee “resigned”


[09-Mar-20 05:05 PM] bman#0435
u were even suspicious because she knew a lot about amiee for someone who doesnt know who she was


[09-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
No she said she didn’t know amie and then said she was a cb later


[09-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
She didn’t know that much about amie until after everyone kept harassing her about it


[09-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525

thats kinda


[10-Mar-20 07:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
recent


[10-Mar-20 09:33 AM] emma;#1525
@bman the first two aren’t even hinting


[10-Mar-20 09:33 AM] emma;#1525
The bottom one kinda is but if they’re not reporting it until now that’s they’re own problem


[10-Mar-20 09:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah the bottom one definitely seems like hinting


[10-Mar-20 09:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Although having it for 1 1/2 months is a bit concenring


[10-Mar-20 09:50 AM] stacey#1000
I really don’t like how people don’t report something and then report them AFTER they earn a promotion thinking they can get them demoted or something


[10-Mar-20 09:50 AM] stacey#1000
And something that’s over a month old, no thanks don’t need it then.


[10-Mar-20 09:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Unless it's leaking or some shit lol


[10-Mar-20 09:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then shit gets real


[10-Mar-20 09:52 AM] stacey#1000
I’m talking about when LRs get promoted to MR then all of a sudden there’s reports of hinting and stuff. Like too late you just mad they got promoted and that’s not going to get them demoted


[10-Mar-20 09:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Question is


[10-Mar-20 09:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Is she really about to do it as an MR


[10-Mar-20 09:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like I have a gut feeling that it may happen


[10-Mar-20 09:53 AM] stacey#1000
If she hints as an MR then she will not be getting management for awhile that’s all we can really do


[10-Mar-20 09:53 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah true


[10-Mar-20 09:53 AM] stacey#1000
Can’t demote or suspend it’s not major offence


[10-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
Someone legit complained to me about rainbow hinting as an Lr and now he’s rank 8


[10-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
But I heard after he was rank 8


[10-Mar-20 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
And they were like “but you don’t want a hinter on the mr team do you?”


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why couldn't they just put it in the hinting channel and such


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] stacey#1000
Idek


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
That would've made way more sense


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] stacey#1000
But it legit made me annoyed and I explained I couldn’t do anything


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] stacey#1000
Let me see if I can find it


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did they throw a fit


[10-Mar-20 09:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or accepted it


[10-Mar-20 09:57 AM] stacey#1000
Found it

Yeah


[10-Mar-20 09:59 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's a pet peeve


[10-Mar-20 10:00 AM] stacey#1000
“He played dirty to get in” by hinting and like it’s not a major offence people don’t understand that


[10-Mar-20 10:22 AM] emma;#1525
@stacey should we make an announcement about it lol


[10-Mar-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
I think we should


[10-Mar-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
to everyone


[10-Mar-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
not just MRs


[10-Mar-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
like make a general announcement about hinting


[10-Mar-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
so people understand its not a major offence and if they have a report of it to send it in and not send it in when someone earns a promotion because it wont get them demoted


[10-Mar-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
i can make an announcement if u wan t

HINTING REPORTS

Greetings, everyone!

    Recently, there seems to have been a lot of confusion when it comes to people hinting. Hinting is not allowed yes, but it is NOT a major offence. If you hint, it doesn’t mean you can never earn a promotion, it just means it may take longer. Now if it is someone continuously hinting, making it major hinting, that’s another story. Everyone has made mistakes in the past, so we don’t want you feeling really stressed over hinting. 

If you see someone hinting, we ask that you collect the proper evidence and 
report them ASAP in hinting reports. Please don’t keep the report and report the user a month later, because chances are nothing will be done. If you report a user that has earned a promotion with evidence of hinting from a month ago, that will not change their promotion. Hinting is not a demotable offence, as its not a major offence. This is why we ask that whenever you get a hinting report, report them right away. Reporting a user after they earned a promotion will not change their rank. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to message any member of the HR team.

Sincerely,
staceyzn

[10-Mar-20 06:50 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
that the reason the high temperature occurs at around 3pm and not 12 pm is because the amount of solar energy gained by the earth is greater than the amount lost and at around 3pm that number hit an equal w/ the amount of energy lost and from 3pm on the surface loses more energy than gained

[10-Mar-20 09:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
roblox has always been on VR, its just its not popular because its hard to play roblox on VR


[10-Mar-20 09:24 PM] Beartikal#9760

I estimate that @VentiRBLX will hit 20k sometime next week!  It was just at 10k when I first checked it out. Amazing how a successful group is thriving so quicky! Hopefully, it continues that way.

BOBA CAFE AND BOBA DEVELOPER ESTSUKI EXPOSED || PART ONE
If you came expecting a greenlegocats type video with Discord leaks and shocking REAL LIFE crimes, I apologize, but I seriously can't believe this happened to me.

Senior Barista allyjelly993 apparently does not want people to enjoy their experience at Boba. She was also very ...

Yeah I didn’t feel like watching a 10 min video I saw that yesterday


[11-Mar-20 11:54 AM] stacey#1000
Plus I was too lazy to read the subtitles

[11-Mar-20 12:26 PM] emma;#1525
@¢. ღ i sped through it and at first was like wow this kid is overreating but then the dev is EXPLOITING basically


[11-Mar-20 12:26 PM] emma;#1525
overreacting*


[11-Mar-20 12:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ikr.. HE MAKES THE GUY LPOK LIKE HE'S EXPLOITING


[11-Mar-20 12:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I don't see the big deal in him wanting to greet people either tbh


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and I don't think they have an actual position for someone to greet people like that barista said LOL


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i mean i get it, a non staff acting like a staff is always concerning but its not like he was actually saying anything staff related


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ikr


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525
literally just "welcome to boba have a nice day" with proper grammar


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525
they should have just reported him to an MR/HR if they were so bothered by it


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525
but they kept harassing him lmao


[11-Mar-20 12:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I can't get over that former supervisor telling him to stop


[11-Mar-20 12:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I saw a comment that said "this former supervisor acting like she still work there"

😳


[11-Mar-20 01:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
@High Rank so these people who keep trying to get rainbows fired for hinting basically have a Discord server where they trash-talk him and talk about HRs being bias and crap like that. anyways, funny how i found out, their group applied for an alliance with Bloxton so when I joined the Discord server, I saw all their messages LOL. anyways the people involved are aurotixx (quite surprising, former mr role has been removed), stressout (pretty much made it clear he isnt getting promoted anytime soon), and nero. posting proof below:

[11-Mar-20 01:48 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@xM_inn last week Nero was arguing with like everyone in the questions channel about how our group is called Hilton and we’re going to be sued and then a few days later asked what we were doing about the corona virus


[11-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
not gonna lie but


[11-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
i dislike the "cohost or assist" for the senior checklists now


[11-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
because recently


[11-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
people say they want to assist because they have to


[11-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Polk#1596
and then i dont have enough hosts to host every server


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
When did that get added


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Polk#1596
what was so bad about hosting 4 sessions a week


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Polk#1596
min edited the checklists and it turned out like that along with a few other changes i think


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Isn’t co hosting or assisting the same as just going and attending the session


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc I think if they “cohost”


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
They’re not gonna do anything


[11-Mar-20 01:50 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Bc they’re not the host so they don’t need to say rules


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
And they probably don’t name Bc they’re “co hosting”


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
yes, it counts as cohosting or assisting like a management or MR at interviews


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So they probably just stand there and do nothing


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
i guess it made kinda sense back then but right now


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I also thought we had a rule for no co hosting tho


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
i need HOSTS


[11-Mar-20 01:51 PM] Polk#1596
senior managements are HOSTS


[11-Mar-20 01:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Maybe vote to remove it?


[11-Mar-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
ive lost several servers because of this


[11-Mar-20 01:52 PM] Polk#1596
ok i can do it after my training


[11-Mar-20 01:52 PM] Cooqkie#2809

@stacey well heres the thing,

that group has had some many different presidents


[11-Mar-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
that the president who submitted the request two weeks ago isnt even the president anymore


[11-Mar-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
but they were still trashtalking two weeks ago so oh well


[11-Mar-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000
Wow

[11-Mar-20 03:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[11-Mar-20 03:21 PM] emma;#1525

Hey, @High Rank. I want you guys to hear me out on this suggestion for the Senior Management checklist.

I really dislike the two "Attend Interview/Training Session" requirements on the Senior Management checklist. That is because I believe Senior Managements are mainly meant to host. (Which is true since they got promoted in order to be able to host + more.) Of course, I think they should be able to occasionally assist if needed. I just want their primary goal to be hosting. Sadly, those two requirements ruin that since we are pretty much forcing them to assist at least twice a week. At the time this was added to the checklist, I thought it was very reasonable and smart. However, after having it for a while, I kept getting fewer hosts for my sessions because a large amount of the Senior Managements keeps saying that **need** to assist instead of hosting since it is a requirement on their checklist. They are very right about that, therefore I can't really blame them for trying to get it done. After all, we can't force them to host. This is why I wish to replace those two requirements with "Host a session/assist" instead. So basically, two requirements will be "Host a session" as normal. However, the two other requirements will be "Host a session/assist." This will make it so Senior Managements can continue assisting while still getting two requirements checked off, but in cases when we need hosts, they will be able to host as well without any excuses. In my opinion, I believe it will greatly reduce the lack of hosts problem. (Other than hiring more active Seniors and getting rid of inactive ones) Furthermore, I believe the Senior Managements will like this option way better than the "must assist/cohost in a session" requirement. 

What do you guys think about this idea? I think this is worth discussing. Vote ✅ if you agree or ❌ if you do not agree. If you do not agree, please make sure to give a proper reason on why you do not agree. Thank you!

Since when did we make seniors assist and not host tf


[11-Mar-20 03:22 PM] emma;#1525
I do not remember that rule being implemented


[11-Mar-20 03:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Polk can u cut down ur paragraph into one simple sentence for me!


[11-Mar-20 03:22 PM] bman#0435
before i got shift


[11-Mar-20 03:22 PM] emma;#1525
But I feel like I helped implement it oops


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
ummm no thats hard


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
ok great Bman don’t claim any responsibility


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596

[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525

[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435

[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
basically


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
seniors keep saying


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
Attend does not mean assist


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
by "seniors" r u refering to imag


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
attend means cohost and assist


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
.


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
.


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
Pretty sure we meant attend to give them the option anyways


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435
.


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
But we can clarify it more


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
If that helps


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
wait are u sure-


[11-Mar-20 03:23 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think we need to require them to assist lol


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
I was about to say something similar


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
cuz that is not what the seniors thinks it is


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
We have enough managers again


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
Polk


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
Seniors are dumb


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] xM_inn#2821
they only had to attend 1 of each session per week, they could host the rest


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
honestly saying assist is kind of vague considering theyre seniors


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
And seniors shouldn’t need to do managers jobs


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] bman#0435
so when i was a senior ur telling me i just had to go to the session and do nothing and i would have gotten the credit


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
therefore i suggested to make it


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
host a session/assist


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
they probs think they they dont need to help like a manager bc theyre seniors


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
I STILL THINK CO HOSTING SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] emma;#1525
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
It’s them taking away managers job


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so they might think assisting is co hosting or just being there watching or something


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t see what’s wrong with co-hosting


[11-Mar-20 03:24 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its rly not needed bc


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if theyrer not the host


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre not saying rules


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
proposal: remove the attending requirement & remove the ability for seniors to co-host another senior's session?


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and if theyre not naming


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre jusy standing therre


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
well stacey


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so basically theyre doing nothing


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
I allow seniors to co-host so they can still get the requirement done


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
i let anna and emi host/cohost together because they are basically the same person


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
i dont think it is that bad to let people cohost


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] bman#0435
proposal: remove all seniors and do senior reforms


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
but like


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
forcing them NOT to host


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
is bad


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
better proposal: fire bman


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
thats what i dont like about it


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Cooqkie#2809
0:


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
agreed


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] bman#0435
even better proposal: get min to do checklists on time


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525
Co hosting is two people splitting ONE job


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
even better proposal: i win best bod


[11-Mar-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525
It makes no sense to let seniors count it


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] stacey#1000
Because then it would be harder maybe for all of them to get their hosting requirements done


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
ok well


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
If they’re gonna co host then they should need to co host twice for it to count


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
maybe we can cut it down to hosting 3 sessions


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
Co-hosts are unnecessary really


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
instead of hosting 2 helping at 2


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
wait a minute


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
like emma


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
Bc one of them sitting there doing nothing for half the session is stupid


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
Like Bman


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think seniors should only be allowed to co-host an HR's session, with permission


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
ok guys HOLD UP


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
I NEVER COHOSTED


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn that’s how it is now


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya i agree with min


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
UNLESS IT WAS PROMOVERSARY WITH STACEY


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
But I think we give too much permission


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
i think we should make a clear rule on how co-hosting works instead


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
i let seniors cohost all the time


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
THAT WAS PROBS THE ONLY TIME


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
well


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
my dogs eating used tissues


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think they should be able to count it as hosting a session


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
which includes the cohost has to supervise


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
not stand afk


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
i count managers as cohosts


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
no but i mean like, make it so senior's cant co-host another seniors session


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
its always anna and emily together


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wut


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
like that is reasonable


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause its pointless


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk we can’t monitor that lol


[11-Mar-20 03:26 PM] xM_inn#2821
and a free checklist tick


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] bman#0435
and star with literally anyone


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] bman#0435
mainly cam


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
wellll


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
then


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
we can go check


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
Hosting is not hard


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
during our sesions


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
They do not need to have a co host


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
and see if they are supervising or not


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
HRs don’t do host


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
true but like


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
how are we supposed to make them assist


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
And if we do it’s for a special occasion


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
if theres like


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
4 managements in every server


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] Cooqkie#2809
idk


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] bman#0435
hosting ur literally copying and pasting words u typed on a doc


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] bman#0435
and waiting


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
Then the last manager should have to switch or leave


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
Then we can remove the assist requirement


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
Bc don’t we have a rule on max number of managers


[11-Mar-20 03:27 PM] emma;#1525
In the server

o


[11-Mar-20 03:28 PM] emma;#1525
OK here’s a proposal, no co hosting, no more than 3 managers on a server (4 can be allowed with 15+ trainees)

As I expected, we all have different ideas on how to fix this problem. Some people want to completely remove the assisting option, while others do not. Personally, I do not feel like making it prohibited to assist will solve the problem. We can still let them assist, but we just have to make some clear rules. For example, you are not allowed to co-host if a server is in need of a host. While co-hosting, you must not go AFK and supervise the stations along with the Managements. If the Seniors split the job of hosting, it will basically be the same amount of work a Management does if both ranks supervise. For normal assisting, we can say they may not assist if there's 3 managements in a server. Please vote ✅ if you want to let Seniors assist/co-host, but with some rules that must be followed at all times or vote ❌ if you think it is better to make it prohibited for Seniors to assist in any way. @High Rank

too many rules


[11-Mar-20 03:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
we dont wanna overwhelm the seniors


[11-Mar-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435
were not


[11-Mar-20 03:50 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
let them host one and assist another


[11-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
i disagree, because hosting + supervising is literally what the managements do, but instead they view, name and kick excess


[11-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Polk#1596
@RAMMGaming


[11-Mar-20 04:00 PM] bman#0435
since when do managements host


[11-Mar-20 04:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We are talking minimum requirements here


[11-Mar-20 04:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They can still host more than one


[11-Mar-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
Yes pls change requirements now or if you are @Polk


[11-Mar-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
For seniors


[11-Mar-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000

[11-Mar-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
CHANGE REQUIREMENTS PLS


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
I thought we agreed to change the assist rule


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
I just don’t agree with the allowing co hosting


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
we need to make a final desicion


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
but everyone went off to talk about stapleton


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
Let’s just all agree on the assisting thing for now


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
I vote get rid of attempting thing


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
Attending*


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
decision


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
@Polk put up another ping bc we all love your pings


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
for WHAT


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] bman#0435
UGH LYOO PROMO SUGGESTED DANI AND NOW WHEN I PROMOTE DANI LYOO WILL THINK ITS BECAUSE OF HIM BECAUSE LYOO IS NAIVE UGHGHHGHHGHG


[11-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
Altering the attend rule to say assist or host


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
We can talk about cohosting later


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
It’s not as big of a deal


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
ok so


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
wait


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
i have a better idea


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
a vote between "host" or "host/assist"?


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
go ahead min


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
remove the attending requirement and make it into a hosting requirement


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
so forget the attending altogether


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
just hosting


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] Polk#1596
yes, that is what i thought


[11-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
So back to what we used to do


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we want to add attending back at a later date then sure


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
thats way better


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
Where we ran into the issue of there not being enough servers to host


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
yea emma


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
but like


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
i want them to be allowed to assist


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
Which is why we changed it in the first place...?


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
wait wdym


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
I think they should but we just need to limit the number of managers allowed per server


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
what issue


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
but ONLY if certain requirements are met like for example, no server needs a host


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
wait emma


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] Polk#1596
u want to allow them to assist now?


[11-Mar-20 04:07 PM] emma;#1525
We changed the 4 hosting requirement bc people were struggling with being able to find 4 sessions a week to host


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
they can still attend sessions - its just not a requirement, and hosting should be priority


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
I always did


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t think it should be a requirement tho


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
Just an option, if they want to host 4 times great


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596
emma


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596
thats why i said


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
hm well if we're removing attending and not adding hosting then we need to find something else


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
Polk ive agreed with you this whole time


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596
make two "host" while making the other two optional "host/assist"


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn literally host OR assist


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
OH


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] emma;#1525
Polk I have agreed with that so many times


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
i see what u mean


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] Polk#1596
so they wont have a hard time


[11-Mar-20 04:08 PM] xM_inn#2821
so they can choose


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
THEN WHY DO U KEEP VOTING NO ON THE POLLS


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
Bc you said allow cohosting


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
Which I disagree with


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
So


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
can we make it they should prioritize hosting over assisting tho


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
Invited no


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
ok fine


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
I voted


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
lets ignore the cohosting part


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] xM_inn#2821
if servers need a host*


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
yeah, min


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
that is what i am saying


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn yes


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
they can only assist if all servers are being hosted


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
They can only assist if all servers are full


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Polk#1596
ok can i do another ping


[11-Mar-20 04:09 PM] xM_inn#2821

We did not come to a final decision after our discussion, so I am going to ping ONCE more. (bonnie, if you talk about something not related to this topic you will be sent into timeout) Leaving out the co-hosting thing, we will vote about the assisting part on the Senior checklists. Basically, like I suggested before, I believe it is better to give them the option to assist on two of the requirements instead of making them host on all of them. This will allow them to be able to complete their checklists every week without having problems hosting due to not being quick enough to ask, not enough servers available, etc. Additionally, it will also remove the "I need to assist because I need to check it off on my checklist" problem which we keep on getting whenever we need hosts. We can for example have a rule to make them prioritize hosting as it is their primary job, like for example: seniors may not assist in another server if a server needs a host. So, once again, **leaving out cohosting, just talking about assisting** vote ✅ if you agree with my idea (better agree this time emma) or vote ❌ if you disagree. @High Rank

{Reactions}
✅ (9) ❌ 

[11-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
wait this confused me


[11-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
"I believe it is better to give them the option to assist on two of the requirements instead of making them host on all of them"


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
can u like


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
clarify that


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
> We changed the 4 hosting requirement bc people were struggling with being able to find 4 sessions a week to host
@emma;


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
thats why i said that


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
because it seems like ur saying to make their checklists optional instead of required


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
im trying to make two of the requirements


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
optional to either host or to assist since they have trouble finding servers


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
ohhh ok


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
but to prioritize hosting


[11-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
so like


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
2 can be either hosting or assisting


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
but 2 are def hosting


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
adding up to the 4 in total


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bman#0435
for hosting related


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
yes, so basically the must host requirements wont be changed from the minimums


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
but the "must assist" will be changed


[11-Mar-20 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
yes


[11-Mar-20 04:20 PM] Polk#1596
and oh crap, i will fix them @stacey


[11-Mar-20 04:21 PM] emma;#1525
I agreed Polk

[11-Mar-20 05:44 PM] Polk#1596
Anything I should add to this announcement?


[11-Mar-20 05:44 PM] Polk#1596
Hi, everyone! I am going to announce a few changes to your checklists that will go live on Monday.

After a long discussion with the HR team, we have decided to change two of your requirements for your checklists. From now on, you will no longer be *required* to assist anymore. Those two requirements known as **"Attend Interview Session"** and **"Attend Training Session"** will now be changed into **"Host/Assist Interview Session"** and **"Host/Assist Training Session"**. 

This change was made to allow more servers to be hosted, while you guys still being able to complete your checklist every week without struggling to host. The reason why we replaced two of the hosting requirements to "Attend Interview/Training Session" in the first place was to help the people not being able to host 4 times every week. However, forcing you guys to assist created another problem for us. For example, some people would go: "Sorry, I can't host. I need to assist in order to complete my checklist this week." leaving some servers without a host. We could not really blame you for saying that since you probably just wanted to get it done. It is not like we can force any of you to host, as it is completely voluntary. (Except from the minimum requirements.) After all, the main task of a Senior Management is to host. Therefore, we want our Senior Managements to prioritize hosting instead of assisting. We find it unnecessary to have you guys assist in other servers when we need hosts. Additionally, we feel like most of you will prefer the option to assist rather than being forced to assist. Keep in mind that you guys will be allowed to assist, but that is only as long as there are no more than 3 managements in a server and if every server got a host.

If you have any questions about this change, feel free to ask me or any other HR. I suggest asking in #senior-lounge in case other people have the same question. Have a nice day!

italy and china have the most confirmed cases as of now


[12-Mar-20 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
i feel like the media is over exagerating this


[12-Mar-20 09:19 AM] Polk#1596
true


[12-Mar-20 09:19 AM] Polk#1596
after all, they just want it to stop spreading


[12-Mar-20 09:19 AM] Polk#1596
but the death percentage is very low


[12-Mar-20 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
"we suspect 480,000 deaths within the next 7 months."


[12-Mar-20 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
they legit said that on the radio


[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] stacey#1000
i was like bitch u cant confirm that


[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] Polk#1596

[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] Polk#1596
well


[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] Polk#1596
if everyone stays home


[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] Polk#1596
it will end quickly


[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] stacey#1000
that wont happen sadley


[12-Mar-20 09:20 AM] stacey#1000
sadly*


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
theres like a 99% chance you dont have the coronavirus anymore if u get put in quarantine or whatever for 2 weeks


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
so basically


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
if everyone stayed home


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
for 3-4 weeks


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
it would stop spreading by a lot


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] stacey#1000
i would get too bored


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
true, but its worth a try


[12-Mar-20 09:21 AM] Polk#1596
yeah i feel bad for those people


[12-Mar-20 09:22 AM] Polk#1596
they arent allowed to leave their home at all


[12-Mar-20 09:22 AM] stacey#1000

[12-Mar-20 09:22 AM] stacey#1000

like doing school online


[12-Mar-20 09:23 AM] Polk#1596

[12-Mar-20 09:24 AM] stacey#1000
going to school gives u something to do


[12-Mar-20 09:24 AM] stacey#1000
but sometimes sucks same time


[12-Mar-20 09:25 AM] Polk#1596
exactly


[12-Mar-20 09:25 AM] Polk#1596
plus


[12-Mar-20 09:25 AM] Polk#1596
50% of the reason why i like school


[12-Mar-20 09:25 AM] Polk#1596
is because i get to meet friends like face to face


[12-Mar-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
exactly


[12-Mar-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
so how long is it online


[12-Mar-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000

[12-Mar-20 09:31 AM] stacey#1000

what did u say


[12-Mar-20 10:31 AM] Polk#1596
i think announcing it now will be better, because they will get to know about it a few days before the change goes live rather than getting to know about it on the same day it begins


[12-Mar-20 10:31 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
y'all


[12-Mar-20 10:31 AM] Polk#1596
Hi, everyone! I am going to announce a few changes to your checklists that will go live on Monday.

After a long discussion with the HR team, we have decided to change two of your requirements for your checklists. From now on, you will no longer be required to assist anymore. Those two requirements known as "Attend Interview Session" and "Attend Training Session" will now be changed into "Host/Assist Interview Session" and "Host/Assist Training Session". 

This change was made to allow more servers to be hosted, while you guys still being able to complete your checklist every week without struggling to host. The reason why we replaced two of the hosting requirements to "Attend Interview/Training Session" in the first place was to help the people not being able to host 4 times every week. However, forcing you guys to assist created another problem for us. For example, some people would go: "Sorry, I can't host. I need to assist in order to complete my checklist this week." leaving some servers without a host. We could not really blame you for saying that since you probably just wanted to get it done. It is not like we can force any of you to host, as it is completely voluntary. (Except from the minimum requirements.) After all, the main task of a Senior Management is to host. Therefore, we want our Senior Managements to prioritize hosting instead of assisting. We find it unnecessary to have you guys assist in other servers when we need hosts. Additionally, we feel like most of you will prefer the option to assist rather than being forced to assist. Keep in mind that you guys will be allowed to assist, but that is only as long as there are no more than 3 managements in a server and if every server got a host.

If you have any questions about this change, feel free to ask me or any other HR. I suggest asking in #senior-lounge in case other people have the same question. Have a nice day! @xM_inn

@High Rank What are your opinions on southkoreahn and possibly terminating him? We have experienced him being very unprofessional  and major trolling with this user and it hasn't been getting any better since when he changed his name to margrettehatcher3113. These actions are posted above somewhere in this chat, and I believe we should vote on a consequence for what he has been doing. 
:HittingAYeet: - nothing
:blobcatgent: - warn verbally/written
:blobcatghost: - suspend

i just got a report of south being banned at SB and i've contacted an HR for more details sooooo 😬


[12-Mar-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435
fun!!!


[12-Mar-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I honestly think she deserves a termination.


[12-Mar-20 03:44 PM] Cooqkie#2809
have they been punished before or is this the first time


[12-Mar-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435
trey south is a boy


[12-Mar-20 03:44 PM] bman#0435
im pretty sure


[12-Mar-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@Cooqkie we lectured him


[12-Mar-20 03:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i changed my cursor to be pickle rick


[12-Mar-20 03:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think she deserves to be gone, no doubt about that.


[12-Mar-20 03:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And with this happening in the span of less than a month is simply unacceptable.


[12-Mar-20 03:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's basically three offenses we're dealing with here at once, he's done honestly.


[12-Mar-20 03:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also, what evidence do you have at the moment? @katie

[12-Mar-20 03:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did she do something though?


[12-Mar-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435
r u dumb


[12-Mar-20 03:49 PM] katie#0200
I'm assuming she did, I was told that there's no logs of her being banned but I suppose we could ask her?


[12-Mar-20 03:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman, I read correctly.


[12-Mar-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435
thats y katie is asking an hr


[12-Mar-20 03:50 PM] katie#0200
oh hold on


[12-Mar-20 03:50 PM] katie#0200
they're getting someone else to check pbans in case it wasnt logged


[12-Mar-20 03:50 PM] bman#0435

[12-Mar-20 03:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
listen


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
whenever i ask her to slock and kick


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
she just slocks


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and doesnt kick


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so im pending for 5 mins bc i dont know she didnt kick


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so i have to tell her to kick again


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and she kicks like


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809
3 people


[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[12-Mar-20 03:57 PM] katie#0200

[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
someone needs to tell her


[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
to listen to what we tell her


[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if we say slock and kick


[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
she needs to slock and kick


[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and kicking 5 people is normal so


[12-Mar-20 03:58 PM] bman#0435
same thing with star


[12-Mar-20 04:11 PM] emma;#1525
@bman has south been suspended yet


[12-Mar-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
Outside of the “hacked” investigation


[12-Mar-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
Because we really shouldn’t jump to termination before a suspension


[12-Mar-20 04:12 PM] emma;#1525
But I don’t remember if he was already or not lol


[12-Mar-20 04:12 PM] bman#0435
lemme see


[12-Mar-20 04:13 PM] bman#0435
according to the board no i but swear hes been suspended before


[12-Mar-20 04:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But she did meme her suspension while being investigated.


[12-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bman#0435
trey


[12-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
did u suspend them


[12-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
because


[12-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
if so


[12-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bman#0435
u forgot to put on hr board

[12-Mar-20 04:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It doesn't really count as a suspension though.


[12-Mar-20 04:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't we usually void them once we know they're the original person?


[12-Mar-20 04:21 PM] bman#0435
no


[12-Mar-20 04:21 PM] bman#0435
we still put it on the board


[12-Mar-20 04:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It technically doesn't count, but oh well.


[12-Mar-20 04:21 PM] bman#0435
we always put it on the board tho


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I guess I can post it? Just a bit weird to do now.


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] bman#0435
under the investigations one


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] bman#0435
no need to do it now


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] bman#0435
since we know he was suspended


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] bman#0435
but


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] bman#0435
ya


[12-Mar-20 04:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he still deserves at least some consequences against him, his attitude is actually really immature now.


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
I agree, I just think a long suspension should be the first consequence


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
Not straight to termination


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
k so vote


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
he also apparently is banned at sb


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She probably did lol


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
and katie is getting details


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
If a long suspension doesn’t show we’re serious than we can terminate ASAP but I think giving south a chance to be like “oh I fucked up” and not completely ruin everything is good


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
she didnt


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
Sb can suck my dick


[12-Mar-20 04:37 PM] emma;#1525
I legit would unally them if I could


[12-Mar-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
that was a weird response


[12-Mar-20 04:38 PM] emma;#1525
Moving on


[12-Mar-20 04:38 PM] bman#0435

um can i just rank both of noah's old hacked accounts to rank 1


[12-Mar-20 05:24 PM] bman#0435
theres no point in keeping it suspended when he literally just makes a new account and he clearly isnt hacked if he can transfer his limiteds to another acocunt so quickly

[12-Mar-20 05:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-Mar-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank iiL0ui has sent an appeal. He is blacklisted and has been for quite awhile, please react if you agree with appealing him or not.If you disagree please let me know why you disagree.

[12-Mar-20 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
Hes been trying to send appeals for awhile.


[12-Mar-20 05:34 PM] katie#0200
honestly


[12-Mar-20 05:36 PM] katie#0200
this is my opinion but i think thats just all bs he really proved he cant be trusted after being unblacklisted the first time


[12-Mar-20 05:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Hard pass.


[12-Mar-20 05:36 PM] katie#0200
idrk whats happened since the bubblegumtube thing but he was so uncooporative and jsut showed signs of wanting to make things 100x harder


[12-Mar-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He literally had no remorse in his appeal which is a big red flag.


[12-Mar-20 05:37 PM] katie#0200
oh yeah that too LOL


[12-Mar-20 05:37 PM] katie#0200
i still have him blocked


[12-Mar-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He also trolled in several of my sessions, sooo. @katie


[12-Mar-20 05:37 PM] katie#0200

[12-Mar-20 05:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

Jan 7th. @katie


[12-Mar-20 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
So he was appealed of a blacklist before?


[12-Mar-20 05:38 PM] katie#0200
yes


[12-Mar-20 05:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes.

[12-Mar-20 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[12-Mar-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He was a pain in the ass in my DMs.


[12-Mar-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
So ill inform him it is declined for the reason of him being appealed before of a blacklist and things not going well, and no remorse in his appeal


[12-Mar-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't forget to tell him he has no appeals permitted.


[12-Mar-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
okay


[12-Mar-20 05:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He had his chance and blew it.

[12-Mar-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I blocked him so he can't message me


[12-Mar-20 05:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[12-Mar-20 05:41 PM] stacey#1000

staceyToday at 6:42 PM
Unfortunately, this appeal is not being accepted due to no remorse being shown. Also, you were appealed from a blacklist before, given a second chance and that didn’t go too well. A blacklist also means you have no appeals permitted, so you cannot appeal at this time. apologies.
LouiToday at 6:42 PM
What
Who said that


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
he wasnt banned for a while


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
lol


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
he was banned like last month or 2 months ago


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
he wants to appeal his discord now


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
like no


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No.


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
bevause someone appealed him


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
blacklist means banned from everything


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
no


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He is banned from all Bloxton platforms, no doubt.


[12-Mar-20 05:43 PM] bman#0435
^


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not having him cause trouble for a 3rd time, pass.


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
he said


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
he was banned on disrcord


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
for wearing mr uniform


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
and wants to appeal for just the discord


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He was banned at the Interview Center.


[12-Mar-20 05:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
After his treatment w/ me and Katie, no thanks.


[12-Mar-20 05:45 PM] stacey#1000
why was he banned from discord


[12-Mar-20 05:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He accused me of "hating him" even though he made a complete ass of himself.


[12-Mar-20 05:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He violated rule 2. @stacey


[12-Mar-20 05:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
He literally joined me at the hotel today on an ALT so no


[12-Mar-20 05:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I definitely wouldn't recommend appealing him from all Bloxton platforms.


[12-Mar-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
can i just block him


[12-Mar-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Your choice.


[12-Mar-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
hes been annoying me for appeals


[12-Mar-20 05:46 PM] stacey#1000
for awhile


[12-Mar-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I blocked him myself.


[12-Mar-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I'm sure Minn has to.

.....


[12-Mar-20 05:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You can basically inform him that he had consequences before.


[12-Mar-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And with all of his major offenses towards the group, that's basically a lot on his plate.


[12-Mar-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
im gonna stop replying to him


[12-Mar-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

@everyone Allow awaiting training in the ceremony? (My guess is no bc they take up space for actual staff)


[13-Mar-20 12:09 AM] babymariobebe#7563
And help me determine how many players we should have in a server


[13-Mar-20 12:13 AM] stacey#1000
No because there is likely CBs that are trainees and they will just troll and ruin the awards. @babymariobebe


[13-Mar-20 12:15 AM] stacey#1000
Player count idk. Whatever doesn’t cause a lot of lag. If it’s like 80+ players it may lag out like in the past at training sessions. Maybe make it like 60-65 at most. Whatever is less lag. Even 50 would work since I’m guessing we would be streaming or someone would like last year and stuff. Not everyone can fit on server regardless.


[13-Mar-20 12:16 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
No thanks.


[13-Mar-20 12:18 AM] stacey#1000
I honestly won’t be surprised if there is CBs regardless cause they still manage to get staff accounts. They now claim they have main accs and tell MRs that and log into it and everything to trick them.


[13-Mar-20 12:19 AM] stacey#1000
I failed like 3 people at int earlier and told MRs they were not getting a rank cause they tricked them with their fake main accs.

@xAfroTrey since when could awaiting trainees not get talkative role


[13-Mar-20 10:36 AM] stacey#1000
Staff members can’t


[13-Mar-20 10:36 AM] stacey#1000
But awaiting trainees can because they still can’t access server

@High Rank Jx_sy account was hacked, therefore her account is suspended and someone bypassed on it to. Do not attack her, as it was hacked. She also cannot be promoted until it is verified she has gotten her account back.


[13-Mar-20 11:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
***attacks***


[13-Mar-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
Don't ban her account for bypassing.


[13-Mar-20 11:50 AM] bman#0435
brb: attacking and banning


[13-Mar-20 11:50 AM] Polk#1596

[13-Mar-20 11:50 AM] Polk#1596
thx for letting us know


[13-Mar-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
@katie Hold off on promoter her for a bit


[13-Mar-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
since its hacked


[13-Mar-20 11:52 AM] katie#0200
ok


[13-Mar-20 12:00 PM] stacey#1000
Update: she contacted ROBLOX and has gained access to her account again, so basically just if you see a report of her bypassing it wasn't her. Good to promote again.


[13-Mar-20 12:00 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank Got a report from Tresni against A_Wolf4Life basically showcasing how he was falsely kicking her for no clothing but she has a blue avatar. Not worth a suspension but more of a verbal warning, so I'm pinging y'all to let you know of the report. If you want to give him the verbal warning then go ahead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roOjdtGmD2Y&feature=youtu.be

@High Rank One of our MRs A_Wolf4Life got their account terminated. For further information, look at the screenshots below. I say we re-rank him since it was not really his fault.

[14-Mar-20 11:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So


[14-Mar-20 11:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
They kick for mass spamming


[14-Mar-20 11:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So it has to fill the chatbox


[14-Mar-20 11:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
<:


[14-Mar-20 11:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So if like they just send dots like one dot at a time and it fills the chatbox


[14-Mar-20 11:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809
They can kick


[14-Mar-20 11:37 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[14-Mar-20 11:40 PM] a. ღ#4222

[14-Mar-20 11:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
syaing a word


[14-Mar-20 11:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
4 times


[14-Mar-20 11:40 PM] a. ღ#4222

[14-Mar-20 11:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Like


[14-Mar-20 11:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
One after the other?


[14-Mar-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I think as long as it fills the entire chatbox it’s a kick


[14-Mar-20 11:42 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Or like mostly filled


[14-Mar-20 11:44 PM] a. ღ#4222

What are we doing about Wolf_4Life being banned on his main account?


[15-Mar-20 11:10 AM] bman#0435
his story doesnt seem real or seem like the actual reason but i think we should rank back on an alt since roblox terminates for the stupidest reasons


[15-Mar-20 11:11 AM] bman#0435
im saying his story doesnt seem real because he based it all off of wanting a refund...


[15-Mar-20 11:11 AM] bman#0435

@ethan; oh god tell trip that people need to DM us directly that’s ridiculous that she’s talking to you for another MR 🤦🏼‍♀️


[15-Mar-20 11:54 AM] bman#0435
@High Rank can we make a new rule where mrs have to directly dm us if they have an issue and not have other mrs message us for them? its getting annoying and i feel bad for trip as it seems like everyone is using her as a little walkie talkie to message us

@High Rank Hoo boy, it's ping time. Alright, so Kattnine9 is basically asking for an appeal from the Discord server. The reason of her banning was due to 9 warning(s), mainly of her being problematic when the Serenso shit was going on. Regarding her accounts, she had 1 account that was bypassing her ban, but it was May 2019. Let's take a vote. 🟢 - Eligible for Appeal. 🔴 - Remain Banned.

I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.


[16-Mar-20 01:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bonnie, no offense, but it seems like you're kind of favoring him at this point.


[16-Mar-20 01:19 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

He wasted a good chunk of 10 minutes of our time and did this twice.


[16-Mar-20 01:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thanks, but no thanks.


[16-Mar-20 01:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not to mention, his record is extremely awful.


[16-Mar-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Getting role taken 3+ times, trolling on tickets twice, being impatient for ticket wait duration, fired for admitting to sending porn and lying?


[16-Mar-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry, but we deserve better than this. And god forbid, we're not doing ourselves any favors with him still being around the Bloxton Discord.

[16-Mar-20 04:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
1 - 250 robux
2/3 - 350 robux
4+ - 450
Around 12 - 500
24 - 1000


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
I love the pay scales 😍


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
.


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
Is that even


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
Accurate


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sort of


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] ethan;#0003
I think that if u do 1 session u should get 1k and the more you do the less you ger t


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe 12 is like 600


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
YES ETHAN


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think we should pay for sessions not servers


[16-Mar-20 04:17 PM] Polk#1596
bonnie u will get ur list in dms shortly c:


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
But 1 session is 250 robux so technically 4 is 1k if it was proper


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
How is one 250


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
i hereby award u


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Baby does this thing


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
I thought 25 servers was like 1k


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] Polk#1596
the most sessions hosted last week award @stacey


[16-Mar-20 04:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
The minimum pay is 350 as you used to have to do 2 training minimum a week but if u do 1 u get 250


[16-Mar-20 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
I GOT 2ND PLACE


[16-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
So technically 250 is the minimum


[16-Mar-20 04:19 PM] Polk#1596
these two noobs got 20 and 18 @xAfroTrey @¢. ღ get on my level aka 21


[16-Mar-20 04:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Then it goes up slower the more u do and caps at 1k

holly: got doxxed and is super against doxxing


[16-Mar-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
also holly: has people added to her personal snapchat that have literally affiliated with doxxers before such as zion


[16-Mar-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
🤦‍♀️


[16-Mar-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
if she gets doxxed im not helping her


[16-Mar-20 05:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[16-Mar-20 05:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[16-Mar-20 06:02 PM] emma;#1525
hadley isn't an MR we are not entitled to help her if she gets doxxed


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah true


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
we're not even entitled to help MRs


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she needs to switch accs no cap


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and make it private this time


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
like if holly gets doxxed again bc she gave her info out and is acting like she has no idea who she sent it too


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
if tiktok has that setting


[16-Mar-20 06:03 PM] emma;#1525
sorry but im not dealing with that


[16-Mar-20 06:04 PM] emma;#1525
if your username is the same as roblox or discord, or you send your account to some people and they send it to more and more and you get doxxed that is legit your own fault

Harriet actually decided to apologize to me for being rude but like as if I care. She’s done too much shit and like hell I’ll ever actually trust her. Im just getting all the information out of her to ban these doxers then blocking her again


[17-Mar-20 02:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
@Bloo_Berriez I was being nice ):


[17-Mar-20 02:18 PM] a. ღ#4222
@Polk hi polky!


[17-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
u know at stapleton @stacey


[17-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
she went up to me and said like


[17-Mar-20 02:19 PM] Polk#1596
"polk, im sorry for being annoying and killing you"


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
and then she said


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
"i also have to apologize for this"


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
"for everything i have done to bloxton"


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
Wow


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Polk#1596
OOP


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] Cooqkie#2809
what did she do


[17-Mar-20 02:20 PM] stacey#1000
She apologized for going around and telling rumours about me :thonking:


[17-Mar-20 02:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[17-Mar-20 02:21 PM] Cooqkie#2809
were they bad rumors


[17-Mar-20 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
She was telling people not to trust me and that I was telling people to call her a disease and all that crap. Telling it to my close friends and trying paint an image that I’m some horrible person or some crap


[17-Mar-20 02:22 PM] stacey#1000
When I had never said a word to her


[17-Mar-20 02:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[17-Mar-20 02:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait


[17-Mar-20 02:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
so if youve never talked to her before


[17-Mar-20 02:22 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y would she do that to u


[17-Mar-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
I’m only talking to her to get this information to ban all the alt accounts of the person who doxxed Hadley


[17-Mar-20 02:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[17-Mar-20 02:23 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[17-Mar-20 02:23 PM] stacey#1000
She’s acting like we are all of a sudden bffs


[17-Mar-20 02:24 PM] stacey#1000
But here’s the thing. I will never trust her nor will I ever fall for her crap


[17-Mar-20 02:24 PM] stacey#1000
She’s giving me information and that’s the only reason I will speak to her


[17-Mar-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
o im promoting ria in a dif server @Cooqkie


[17-Mar-20 02:32 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey Hadley’s tiktok is public, it’s her fault she’s being doxxed if she’s willingly letting people find her tiktok


[17-Mar-20 02:32 PM] emma;#1525
Harriet also sent me a long thing about how she figured out it was me and trey who reported her to SB


[17-Mar-20 02:32 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t trust her at all lol


[17-Mar-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
I’m just seeing what info I can get from her. This person apparently doxxed other people too


[17-Mar-20 02:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I would take it with a grain of salt


[17-Mar-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y would u make your tik tok private and then be worried about ppl seeing who you are


[17-Mar-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
like


[17-Mar-20 02:39 PM] Cooqkie#2809
isnt that just asking for people to find out


[17-Mar-20 02:41 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie you would think lol idk what she expected to have happen with a pubic tiktok


[17-Mar-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The least she can do is deactivate it


[17-Mar-20 02:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
did she like


[17-Mar-20 02:41 PM] Cooqkie#2809
tell people what it was


[17-Mar-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But my god


[17-Mar-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Had is kind of dumb for this one


[17-Mar-20 02:42 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie I don’t think so but like if it’s the same user as her roblox or instagram (which she’s probably shared with people) then it wouldn’t be hard to find her


[17-Mar-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[17-Mar-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
wait


[17-Mar-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
its her roblox username?


[17-Mar-20 02:43 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y would u do that tho


[17-Mar-20 02:45 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t know if it is


[17-Mar-20 02:45 PM] emma;#1525
But that would make sense as to why she’s been doxxed a few times


[17-Mar-20 02:45 PM] emma;#1525
That’s how Holly’s was found


[17-Mar-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve send hadleys tik tok because she followed mine and I never even posted anything on mine so


[17-Mar-20 02:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
im never making a tik tok


[17-Mar-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
But yeah I’m just gonna tell Harriet that Hadley made her social media accounts public for anyone to find


[17-Mar-20 02:46 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i only watch them


[17-Mar-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
So


[17-Mar-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
It’s her fault


[17-Mar-20 02:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[17-Mar-20 03:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; so if we see someone we want to promote and they have a card on the SB we just move it right


[17-Mar-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
@bman @Bloo_Berriez hurry up I need a training server to start preparing for my theme session!!!


[17-Mar-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
shush


[17-Mar-20 03:06 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie i wouldn't bc that would tip off the seniors that we're wanting to promote them lol but you can make a new card on the HR board and link the senior board card to it so that we can easily access the comments


[17-Mar-20 03:06 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ok


[17-Mar-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
No fr I need to start building soon

[17-Mar-20 05:11 PM] bman#0435
because she does seem sorry


[17-Mar-20 05:11 PM] bman#0435
she added more to the apology then to the details in her ban


[17-Mar-20 05:11 PM] bman#0435
which made me conflicted


[17-Mar-20 05:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

It’s sad because


[18-Mar-20 01:38 AM] a. ღ#4222
Ofc all of that stuff they say can look bias and shit and ofc we can look bad


[18-Mar-20 01:38 AM] a. ღ#4222
Yet they know


[18-Mar-20 01:38 AM] a. ღ#4222
Nothing about what happens


[18-Mar-20 01:38 AM] a. ღ#4222
They only know what they see not every detail into consideration for things like we do


[18-Mar-20 01:38 AM] a. ღ#4222
😦


[18-Mar-20 01:38 AM] a. ღ#4222
!!):


[18-Mar-20 01:39 AM] stacey#1000
Legit they said they had people as management getting info. Like I’ve seen no photos leaked or anything so it’s probably all bs. Probably a former told them about laser tag and stuff


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
I left the server


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] a. ღ#4222
They call emma inactive when she handles like all the fucking investigations like they know nothing


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
I told them that they don’t how how promotions work


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
Twice


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] a. ღ#4222
well clearly they also don’t have a working brain


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] stacey#1000
And I roasted them for being an immature child crying out for attention


[18-Mar-20 01:40 AM] a. ღ#4222
they are obsessed with us!!):


[18-Mar-20 01:41 AM] a. ღ#4222
They love us!!):


[18-Mar-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
Like big deal someone told them about laser tag. Like we don’t even really do it anymore


[18-Mar-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
Like I for one don’t do it


[18-Mar-20 01:41 AM] a. ღ#4222
What’s even wrong with that


[18-Mar-20 01:41 AM] stacey#1000
That’s old news now


[18-Mar-20 01:42 AM] stacey#1000
And I knew they would call me bias and complain I was promoted to general.


[18-Mar-20 01:42 AM] stacey#1000
Big deal grow up and stop crying for attention


[18-Mar-20 01:42 AM] stacey#1000
sad kids wasting their time with this. When they get older and people ask what they did for hobbies “I made tea servers to cry out for attention”


[18-Mar-20 01:43 AM] a. ღ#4222
oh well


[18-Mar-20 01:43 AM] a. ღ#4222
I’m not giving them attention cause


[18-Mar-20 01:43 AM] a. ღ#4222
That’s what they want


[18-Mar-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah that’s why I left server after roasting them a bit and then getting the fake news of their assumptions

Greetings MR team!

I am here to present an ongoing issue that the HR team has been viewing over the past few months. We have noticed a majority of you are turning to certain MRs and having them present your own issues to us. This should not be tolerated. If you are responsible enough to carry an MR rank, you should be responsible enough to address your own issues and not having other people do it for you. Having other people talk to HRs about your own situations is adding in someone who should not be involved in the first place. If you have an issue that needs to be addressed to the HR team, whether it is a personal or group-wide issue, then you should present it by yourself. Thank you and have a nice day.

We understand some of you may feel uncomfortable messaging HRs, but you shouldn’t ever feel that way as we are all a team here. If you have an issue messaging a certain HR, message a different HR.  Don’t be afraid to approach us, as the issue may never get resolved if you never address it.


[18-Mar-20 10:25 AM] stacey#1000
@bman add that after the sentence “having other people talk to HRs for you...etc”

k


[18-Mar-20 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
I feel like this sentence here should be reworded: change the “if you are responsible enough to carry an MR rank, you should be responsible enough to address your own issues to” 

Carrying an MR rank means you are a role model for others, and shouldn’t be having to make others talk about your concerns for you. Talking to friends about it may make you feel more comfortable, but that doesn’t mean they should be addressing the issue to an HR for you. If it helps, you can address the issue with them, but don’t make them do it all for you.


[18-Mar-20 10:33 AM] stacey#1000

We understand some of you may feel uncomfortable messaging HRs, but you shouldn’t ever feel that way as we are all a team here. If you have an issue messaging a certain HR, message a different HR.  Don’t be afraid to approach us, as the issue may never get resolved if you never address it. If you have an issue that needs to be addressed to the HR team, whether it is a personal or group-wide issue, then you should present it by yourself. If you have any questions of concerns, please feel free to contact any member of the HR team. Thank you and have a nice day.

Greetings MR team!

I am here to present an ongoing issue that the HR team has been viewing over the past few months. We have noticed a majority of you are turning to certain MRs and having them present your own issues to us. This should not be tolerated. If you are responsible enough to carry an MR rank, you should be responsible enough to address your own issues and not having other people do it for you. Carrying an MR rank means you are a role model for others, and shouldn’t be having to make others talk about your concerns for you. Talking to friends about it may make you feel more comfortable, but that doesn’t mean they should be addressing the issue to an HR for you. If it helps, you can address the issue with them, but don’t make them do it all for you. Having other people talk to HRs about your own situations is adding in someone who should not be involved in the first place.

omg stacey @stacey @emma; it was funny after you guys left last night cause I got a gun and Grace was our getaway driver, and me and Kyle shot like 2 people and we’re on a pursuit for like 15 minutes and grace tried doing all these turns but the cops were still on us and I kept shooting from out the window and almost caused the car to catch on fire


[18-Mar-20 01:46 PM] emma;#1525
LOL BLOO omg


[18-Mar-20 01:47 PM] emma;#1525
@bman Im not gonna have time to investigate nni2 in the next few days so if you want to promote her anyways go ahead


[18-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525

@High Rank We need to figure out this alloe thing once and for all, and so here's what's going down. Anyone who cares (which should be almost all of you) needs to write a short statement on why they **do** or **don't** think Alloe should get a promotion. Any proof as to her being a CB I want added to her promotion opinion card so that we can all see it clearly. Same if anyone has proof that she isn't a CB. I'm over all of this back and forth and "we need to discuss it" when I told you guys a month ago to either get solid proof or we're promoting her, and now that we're at that "promoting" her point suddenly people are concerned. I'm traveling home today so that gives you guys plenty of time to say where you stand. Please start your paragraphs with **Alloe Opinion** so they can be easily searched for. AFTER saying your opinion you may add your vote to this message. 

Also if anyone gives a sarcastic or sassy response then your opinion is automatically invalidated.  We need act like HRs about this, so let's please do our jobs.

[18-Mar-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
I said to vote AFTER putting your paragraph up


[18-Mar-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
It's not like we're making the choice right now you have plenty of time


[18-Mar-20 02:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I sent proof a long time ago to polk and min so


[18-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
I said clearly in my message I'm busy all day lol I'm gonna wait for at least like 8 people to put opinions up before we make a choice


[18-Mar-20 02:03 PM] a. ღ#4222
I do have suspicions of alloe but literally I don’t care cause we have no proof


[18-Mar-20 02:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
No response from either one


[18-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
ok well the rest of us would like to see it too bliss so please add it to the HR board


[18-Mar-20 02:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I will rn


[18-Mar-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525
i moved her card to the top


[18-Mar-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525
so it's easier to see


[18-Mar-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525
ok i gtg have fun


[18-Mar-20 02:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ok I added the proof


[18-Mar-20 02:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
We have no concrete proof that she’s a cb


[18-Mar-20 02:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
exactly


[18-Mar-20 02:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
we can't just go off our own assumptions and I realised that


[18-Mar-20 02:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
like ok my suspicions are high of her being a cb because of what everyone said but they could be lying who knows


[18-Mar-20 02:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Also it doesn't take that long to review the proof and make a decision or not lol


[18-Mar-20 02:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
It's been literally a week


[18-Mar-20 02:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
🤷‍♀️


[18-Mar-20 02:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
Clearly she deserves a promotion


[18-Mar-20 02:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Since I sent the evidence to both min and polk


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I get they are doing other stuff but like it only takes 2 minutes, not even that to review


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thing is, if she was basically promoted and she's truly a CB, evidence would surface.


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
mhm, she literally felt guilty last time


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's a risk to take, but one that might be simply worth it.


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
Why would see do it again


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Like I may sound impatient but we can't keep stuff on hold like this like we usually do and end up forgetting about it


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ikr


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
She *


[18-Mar-20 02:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
ik bliss


[18-Mar-20 02:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
Ok I gotta go bye y’all


[18-Mar-20 02:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she could've been a manager by now 😂


[18-Mar-20 02:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok let's not go that far 😂


[18-Mar-20 02:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I know but I'm just saying


[18-Mar-20 02:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she might be addie for all we know

anyways @xM_inn read above pls thx


[18-Mar-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Please actually read it this time, you've kind of avoided this quite often.


[18-Mar-20 02:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No offense.


[18-Mar-20 02:14 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah I agree


[18-Mar-20 02:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I mean I dmed u day after day reminding u abt it but I didn't receive a response so


[18-Mar-20 02:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You're not gonna like I'm gonna say, but that's kind of poor leadership here.


[18-Mar-20 02:15 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[18-Mar-20 02:16 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I get u wanna play stapleton or whatever but id at least like a response about it, since it's rly important


[18-Mar-20 02:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Speaking of late responses.


[18-Mar-20 02:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
polk replied but he just asked how it was proof then I explained but never got a response


[18-Mar-20 02:17 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
the only reason I'm talking about this is because it's been put off for too long when it's something really important


[18-Mar-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@High Rank I need at least one more vote on the Kattnine9 appeal I've sent out. If you guys disagree, just let me know as I have 4 agreements at the moment. The rule is mainly 5 votes for things like these, so help me out. I don't want to hear any snarky comments or "who asked" comments, I'm not playing around.


[18-Mar-20 02:18 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Like i said I get ur busy doing other stuff but it really doesn't take long to review it, ask for our opinion, and decide whether or not she would be promoted


[18-Mar-20 02:18 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I agree so, I checked yes


[18-Mar-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's this message if you guys need a reference.

ngl I really don't like how we put off stuff like this and end up forgetting about it


[18-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I'm not even trying to be rude but I think it's an issue


[18-Mar-20 02:19 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Especially when we have investigations pending over Mrs and stuff


[18-Mar-20 02:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I'm usually known as the forgetful one, I don't need a whole team applying my habits.


[18-Mar-20 02:20 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
rainbow supposedly leaked and this investigation has been going on for what, a month now?


[18-Mar-20 02:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Lowkey, I think the case should be dropped.


[18-Mar-20 02:20 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I'm pretty sure there's proof against rainbow too


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
Min just wanted to question  the person who received the info


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but they never responded


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They didn't respond, that's the problem. @¢. ღ


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
most likely to protect rainbow


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I mean


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I've received a report that he leaked before but the person  didn't have evidence


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I think it was the former mr Matt that told me


[18-Mar-20 02:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
this was before proof was sent about rainbow


[18-Mar-20 02:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
I think Katie and stacey received a report too


[18-Mar-20 02:22 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
let me find the proof real quick

why does he always tag roblox tho


[18-Mar-20 06:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he acts like roblox is gonna respond back and be like "We're on that right away mr. Jack!! Thank you for informing us and making sure we're improving everyday!"


[18-Mar-20 06:44 PM] ethan;#0003
@PackItUpMack jack things he is a direct link to roblox

[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ why did i just join one of your second servers to see a game of duck duck goose going on while there are still trainees being trained


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
which senior let this happen lol


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
......


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
it was drew and exotic's server


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
if you want to yell at whoever was hosting


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
was it excess


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
bc we're defo supposed to be encouraging them to stay professional


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think so bc there were only 30 people on the server anyways


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
but maybe


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
was it the beginning


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
no


[18-Mar-20 07:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ehhhh


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
o


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
there are legit trainees training


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
right now


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
emma im not good at yelling no one takes me seriously


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
and they're playing duck duck goose in the lobby with i guess excess?


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ do you want me to


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
yes


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
.


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
.


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hmm


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
but


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
are they allowed to do that


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why not put out an announcement about no excess games


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
^


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're a huge time waster and make the session longer


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
they're supposed to be staying professional on servers and defo shouldn't be keeping excess for no reason


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
i feel like that would be more useful


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ was exotic or drew the host


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
of that server


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why not both


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
cause a lot of seniors do it


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
neither are listed on trello


[18-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222

[18-Mar-20 07:08 PM] a. ღ#4222

[18-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[18-Mar-20 07:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
remind them about it and we could also provide an announcement


[18-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
OH there was a fourth one


[18-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525

@xAfroTrey where is it


[18-Mar-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525

[18-Mar-20 07:10 PM] emma;#1525
just seniors


[18-Mar-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435

[18-Mar-20 07:10 PM] bman#0435
but i feel like he would have asked instead of doing lol


[18-Mar-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
probably but excess games aren't really fitting to a training session


[18-Mar-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
those are way more suited towards themed ones


[18-Mar-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435
they need perm to do it


[18-Mar-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435
i was told as a senior to get perms if i wanted to


[18-Mar-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think they should really happen at all lol


[18-Mar-20 07:11 PM] bman#0435
ya theres no purpose


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] bman#0435
makes server more hectic


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think its a misunderstanding an announcement would just be good


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it just holds back the staff and trainees to actually go to their sations


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
stations*


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] bman#0435
like unless its for a promotion or themed session


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] bman#0435
then no


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'll start writing once my shift is over


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
might take 30 mins, might take an hour


[18-Mar-20 07:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
who knows how it'll go


[18-Mar-20 07:14 PM] emma;#1525
i love that we can tag only seniors now


[18-Mar-20 07:14 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey oh were you gonna write something


[18-Mar-20 07:14 PM] emma;#1525
i already made an announcement


[18-Mar-20 07:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh that's fine


[18-Mar-20 07:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[18-Mar-20 08:13 PM] bman#0435
"If she gets enough votes, I'd like to request her promotion be put on hold until the conclusion of Lucas and Oak's investigation, since Nicole was heavily involved and may have ODed Lucas as well."


[18-Mar-20 08:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[18-Mar-20 08:17 PM] bman#0435

emma was going to but she doesnt think its that vital and that proof will surface when we promote


[18-Mar-20 08:20 PM] bman#0435

[18-Mar-20 11:25 PM] ethan;#0003
"i saw it in a gc"


[18-Mar-20 11:26 PM] ethan;#0003
that means he is in the gc with them

@Beartikal for v7 can u do balconies for penthouses and suites again?


[19-Mar-20 09:20 AM] Cooqkie#2809
or just penthouses


[19-Mar-20 09:24 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 you can’t have senior vote for 2 seniors if the max is 20 and we are at 19 seniors rn


[19-Mar-20 09:25 AM] bonnie591#0591
Ok let's fire one then!!


[19-Mar-20 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
@PackItUpMack yes I did a promo blacklist and did that for may 18th but I guess I didn’t notice it then changed all the dates for suspensions too LOL


[19-Mar-20 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
Can we possibly have a shift vote for 1 new shift?


[19-Mar-20 09:25 AM] bonnie591#0591
Unless if you guys resign we are gonna need to look at rank limit increases as we full nearly!!


[19-Mar-20 09:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
You want cam_s ok


[19-Mar-20 09:26 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[19-Mar-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
I mean are we allowed to increase rank limits even

[19-Mar-20 09:27 AM] bonnie591#0591
With effort yes


[19-Mar-20 09:27 AM] bonnie591#0591
Ok


[19-Mar-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
We had 7 ever since Emma and I got general then remember we were discussing hiring new shifts after that then we all decided we didn’t need any


[19-Mar-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
So


[19-Mar-20 09:27 AM] bonnie591#0591

Idk if that’s changed now

But I say 1


[19-Mar-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
So then we can get 2 new seniors

[19-Mar-20 09:28 AM] bonnie591#0591
Majority want 1 senior


[19-Mar-20 09:28 AM] bonnie591#0591
Soo


[19-Mar-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
I voted 1


[19-Mar-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
Because we don’t have room for 2


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Noob


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
Well someone voted 2


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
So u can vote 2 if you want


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Ok


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] Cooqkie#2809
the training board


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] Cooqkie#2809
is kinda full tho


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Still won’t win


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
I mean we fine on sessions


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
But with the management board


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[19-Mar-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
That was major overflow yesterday


[19-Mar-20 09:30 AM] Cooqkie#2809
but dont most of us do mainly sessions


[19-Mar-20 09:30 AM] stacey#1000
Almost at max cards. I cleared it with banning session tho


[19-Mar-20 09:30 AM] Cooqkie#2809
banning sessions r probs faster


[19-Mar-20 09:30 AM] Cooqkie#2809
than if we hired another shift


[19-Mar-20 09:30 AM] Cooqkie#2809
bc theres more seniors


[19-Mar-20 09:30 AM] stacey#1000
Well I wasn’t gonna spend 4 hours clearing it. Got it done 40 mins with seniors helping


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] ethan;#0003
can we just hire june and cam


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
But for real I don’t think it would hurt to get one new shift


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
i think with seniors its def faster than hiring more shifts and having 1 or 2 of us do it at a time


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
bc then theres like 5 ppl doing it


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
compared to 2 ppl


[19-Mar-20 09:31 AM] Cooqkie#2809
or 1 person


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] ethan;#0003
i think we hire 1 senior wait a week or 2 weeks then we seed if we need a new shift


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
“Seed”


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809
yes seed


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] Cooqkie#2809
save that forever


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
Ok let’s start with hiring June


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
Then


[19-Mar-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[19-Mar-20 09:33 AM] Cooqkie#2809
junes a manager right


[19-Mar-20 09:33 AM] Cooqkie#2809
?


[19-Mar-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[19-Mar-20 09:35 AM] Cooqkie#2809
ya i think hiring a senior is better


[19-Mar-20 09:35 AM] Cooqkie#2809
than a shift rn


[19-Mar-20 09:37 AM] stacey#1000

@High Rank Lanegorl is currently under investigation for being unprofessional and seems like she's abusing her commands at the hotel. The footage is located on #ongoing-investigations if you would like to see for yourselves. As always, we'll go through the typical voting process of her punishment. 🔴 - Warning. 🔵 - Suspension. 🟢 - Other. Thank you for reading, and let's try to get through this quickly.

Ok I'm on mobile so it's kinda hard to look back through the messages in the channel, brief explanation of what she did?


[19-Mar-20 12:07 PM] stacey#1000
She admin abused the brought command, bringing people for no reason. Then she was encouraging CBs basically to troll with accounts of someone named "LanegorlFan1M" or something, and she was acting extremely unprofessional around them saying things like "O, RUN FAN" and more.

yes i am xDDDDDDDD


[19-Mar-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
uh well i think we can make an exception if there's a really good candidate for senior


[19-Mar-20 12:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
a warning is literally nothing, it just reminds someone how to behave properly


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
it'd be a shame to not let june have a chance at senior over a small accident she was **honest** about


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok wait as much as I love June, I’m also kinda worried her for if she does become a senior. the other day she needed help naming, and as far as I know I don’t think she has a computer. I could be wrong but it always seems as she’s on mobile


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
shes a mobile user


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
lke only mobile


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
i thought june had a computer too tho


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
mhm that’s what I thought


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
idk


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
i swear she used to use a computer every so often


[19-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
no she only uses mobiek

Greetings, Lanegorl.

This is a letter to inform you of your suspension here at Bloxton Hotels due to admin abuse, and acting unprofessional at the hotel. This suspension will last for a length of 3 days and will end approximately Sunday at 2:00 PM EST. When you are at the hotel, the bring command is only to be used when absolutely needed, such as if someone is stuck in a wall, or a troller has gotten away from security. It is not to bring people randomly whenever you wish. Another thing to consider at the hotel is professionalism. You set an example for other hotel guest and LRs, so when you act unprofessional such as encouraging trollers, abusing capitals, etc, that could encourage unprofessional behaviour from others. Please remember to act professional at all times while at the hotel and to not abuse the moderator commands you are given. We hope you learn from these mistakes over your suspension. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to message any member of the HR team.

just let him send a ban appeal and we can look at it but no promises


[19-Mar-20 01:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
@emma; didn’t he do bad stuff like years ago


[19-Mar-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he*


[19-Mar-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he wasn't even banned or blacklisted


[19-Mar-20 01:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the only consequence he received was having his promotion being held back


[19-Mar-20 01:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and those situations were on V5


[19-Mar-20 01:14 PM] a. ღ#4222

[19-Mar-20 01:15 PM] emma;#1525

he doesn't even have anything held against him


[19-Mar-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what the hell is he talking about


[19-Mar-20 01:15 PM] emma;#1525
You can’t appeal consequences lol


[19-Mar-20 01:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:17 PM] bman#0435
"User has been fired twice and has had one suspension. Since one of the fires were a serve case, I've decided to blacklist him from future promotions."

[19-Mar-20 01:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you could just let him realize it on his own


[19-Mar-20 01:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't like how he's hinting though


[19-Mar-20 01:38 PM] a. ღ#4222
Don’t u think he deserves another chance


[19-Mar-20 01:38 PM] a. ღ#4222
We all were bad people in the past


[19-Mar-20 01:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
His situations were 2 years ago I think


[19-Mar-20 01:38 PM] a. ღ#4222
that’s so long ago


[19-Mar-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:39 PM] a. ღ#4222

[19-Mar-20 01:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
To be my past was bad


[19-Mar-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we just didn't find out you were actually trash talking


[19-Mar-20 01:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but that's only because you had a friendship with cinder


[19-Mar-20 01:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
everyone trash talks ☺️


[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
like


[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
His shit that he did was from two years ago


[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
omer is a senior


[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] a. ღ#4222
Omar *


[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435

[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
omar fam lol


[19-Mar-20 01:40 PM] bman#0435
idk


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] a. ღ#4222
we can’t hold something against him that was so long ago


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
we the blacklist is perm


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
so


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
idk


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
lol


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can make his promotion chances available but


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's definitely hinting here


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
which i don't like


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
^


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] a. ღ#4222
ok but then it could take longer


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
i feel like he came back just for a promotion


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
lol


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
same here


[19-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] a. ღ#4222
doesn’t every lr want a promotion


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] a. ღ#4222
Let’s be real


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's an MR at SB


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so i'm really confused as to what his approach is


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe get another MR position? idk


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] a. ღ#4222
I don’t think that’s his motive


[19-Mar-20 01:42 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think that he thinks that the past is not allowing him to excel

[19-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Do you see why I ignored Ava @katie


[19-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We already suspended her dw @Polk


[19-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Stacey did


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I just did the voting


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn just gave us perms


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
so is he ever gonna get in blacklisted or what


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] Polk#1596
Okay


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
Because if I tell  him “nothing is held against him” it’s basically lying


[19-Mar-20 01:44 PM] a. ღ#4222
Because clearly we are holding shit agaisnt him


[19-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't mind taking him off but like


[19-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait there's no but nvm


[19-Mar-20 01:45 PM] a. ღ#4222

[19-Mar-20 01:47 PM] a. ღ#4222
Their opinion


[19-Mar-20 01:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's almost a year ago jesus christ lol


[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] bman#0435

[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000

I mean add a vote


[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
I dont see an issue with it


[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think it was around 2018 of him implying he can't be promoted


[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
if we've given others a chance again


[19-Mar-20 01:49 PM] a. ღ#4222
Bman no it’s not... I’m not saying “let’s promote him rn” I’m saying let’s not hold shit agaisnt him


[19-Mar-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
story add a vote


[19-Mar-20 01:50 PM] a. ღ#4222

[19-Mar-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
how about we wait until he's even being considered for a promo before voting to remove his blacklist or not lol


[19-Mar-20 01:50 PM] bman#0435
@emma; he hasnt even been here for a month so


[19-Mar-20 01:50 PM] bman#0435
User has been fired twice and has had one suspension. Since one of the fires were a serve case, I've decided to blacklist him from future promotions.


[19-Mar-20 01:50 PM] bman#0435
thats the card desc


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
i know he might change


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
but


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think we need to be making an issue out of it unless he's actually being considered for a promo


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Based on his approach on DMs


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435
he recently came back


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
which i doubt will happen


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg I’m not saying let’s promote him I just think people can change over years and think we shouldn’t hold this stuff agaisnt him


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
bruh moody did more shit than that and hes a manager LOOOL


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] bman#0435

[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I definitely wouldn't promtoe him atm


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
promote*


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] a. ღ#4222
ikr bliss


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ i know that im saying lets not even worry about it until an HR brings up wanting to promote him


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] a. ღ#4222
@emma; ok good idea


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
bc if literally none of us want to anyway then there's no point in voting on it or discussing it right now


[19-Mar-20 01:51 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah


[19-Mar-20 01:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i mean hell alloe's is still pending so


[19-Mar-20 01:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
lol


[19-Mar-20 01:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[19-Mar-20 01:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i can relate


[19-Mar-20 01:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
out of everyone who's discussed about it


[19-Mar-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think it's like 4/6 who agree with her promotion atm


[19-Mar-20 01:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the two being minn and bman who basically disagree i think


[19-Mar-20 01:53 PM] a. ღ#4222
If alloe does get a promo chance I want her promo to be goooddd


[19-Mar-20 01:53 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well, i dont see why but thats their opinion


[19-Mar-20 01:53 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yes


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if its approved before emma & staceys themed


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] bman#0435
no point in writing my paragraph if its not even going to be considered


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hence why i said you disagreed


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] a. ღ#4222
Everything gets considered


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah ^


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think her fanbase is really annoying but that's not her fault lol


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah its not lol


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] a. ღ#4222
it’s just cause she’s active


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wish she wasn't hyped so often


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
mhm


[19-Mar-20 01:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe it's just me but like


[19-Mar-20 01:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i really don't like when there's some type of overhype


[19-Mar-20 01:55 PM] bman#0435

[19-Mar-20 01:55 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[19-Mar-20 01:57 PM] bman#0435
yes it is


[19-Mar-20 01:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause it actually has us visualize future managements


[19-Mar-20 01:57 PM] bman#0435

[19-Mar-20 01:58 PM] bman#0435
everytime i check its mrs or alloe


[19-Mar-20 01:58 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[19-Mar-20 01:58 PM] emma;#1525

[19-Mar-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
majority of the lrs usually have a tendency to fall into stereotypes


[19-Mar-20 01:59 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[19-Mar-20 01:59 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
just like how people assume if they follow mr/hrs into their server theyll get promoted


[19-Mar-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the main problem with many of them is that they're too clingy


[19-Mar-20 01:59 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i agree


[19-Mar-20 01:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[19-Mar-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
far from it


[19-Mar-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

CRYSTAL IS A CB AND A FORMER


[19-Mar-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
HOW DO YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN CRYSTAL’s GC DIDNT SENT IT TO SEBBY


[19-Mar-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525
Through a DIFFERENT gc


[19-Mar-20 02:19 PM] emma;#1525

even though I told you to 🙄

SEBBY could be in a gc with formers and CBS but you’re just making that assumption without actually checking

@Beartikal I thought of promoting that person a month ago but they hint a lot and follow hrs around


[20-Mar-20 11:23 AM] emma;#1525
@katie you’re promoting her even tho she’s been hacked twice in the past like two weeks?


[20-Mar-20 11:24 AM] emma;#1525
do you think we should wait a bit to make sure she’s not gonna be hacked again, bc whoever is hacking her will have more reason to do it if she’s promoted lol


[20-Mar-20 11:24 AM] emma;#1525
Oh wait did it already happen rip


[20-Mar-20 11:26 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[20-Mar-20 11:26 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
it already happened


[20-Mar-20 11:27 AM] emma;#1525
yeah can we like not do that next time lol kinda dangerous

[20-Mar-20 11:28 AM] katie#0200
she told me about all the security stuff she added to her account and her now account as well after she got hacked


[20-Mar-20 11:29 AM] emma;#1525
Didn’t she add a bunch of stuff the first time


[20-Mar-20 11:29 AM] emma;#1525
And still got hacked


[20-Mar-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
she clearly doesnt know what shes doing to secure her account lmao


[20-Mar-20 11:29 AM] emma;#1525
Either way we should be giving people time to make sure they’re not gonna be hacked again, even if they claim to have it under control


[20-Mar-20 11:29 AM] bman#0435
^


[20-Mar-20 11:29 AM] emma;#1525

Hi Mack I need to say something important, I think someone leaked an information.
Basically, I am friends with someone that I never knew she was a CB at Bloxton Hotels. Then, she wanted to tell me a story about her being a CB at Bloxton. Then I said "Nah you were never a CB." Then she said "If you don't believe me, ask an MR/HR to send you a "LIST" ban of CBs. Then I didn't reply her back because I was kinda on a shock of her knowing even though I don't know who leaked that information with her.


[20-Mar-20 11:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont understand


[20-Mar-20 11:58 AM] emma;#1525
so she didnt tell you... who...

[20-Mar-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
i dont think there was any nominating though


[20-Mar-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
and it doesnt look like there's a social group category this year


[20-Mar-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
ya


[20-Mar-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
roblox chose lol


[20-Mar-20 03:07 PM] emma;#1525
so we wouldn't have been eligible anyways


[20-Mar-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
that sucks


[20-Mar-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
not a single category for a group


[20-Mar-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
nope


[20-Mar-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
they're basically saying "fuck you" to all of the big social groups even though we bring in a crap ton of revenue from them


[20-Mar-20 03:08 PM] emma;#1525
i mean our group is bigger than the groups for a lot of the nominated games lol

Has she not seen how she named herself?


[20-Mar-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If she had her little mental issues, why didn't she get off Discord?


[20-Mar-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Better yet, why didn't she answer to Alex?


[20-Mar-20 03:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@xAfroTrey u said she leaked to harriet rite


[20-Mar-20 03:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes, she did.


[20-Mar-20 03:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here, I'll find some evidence.


[20-Mar-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
She legit sent a suicide note to Alex and Alex cried to me in VC worrying.


[20-Mar-20 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
Like, not cool and why put Alex through that


[20-Mar-20 03:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You might wanna mention that it wasn't fair to put Alex through all that stress.


[20-Mar-20 03:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[21-Mar-20 12:06 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank So apparently Daisy (the senior) is talking to Biatrice and making it sound likes she wants to kill herself. No idea if this is legit or another one of those schemes for attention, but I wanted to bring it to your guys' attention. I'm not close with Daisy so I don't feel like it's my place to go talk to her, so if any of you know her well please let me know. I'll post the convo she's had with Biatrice below.

https://trello.com/c/SgQF1hUj


[21-Mar-20 01:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Also you suspended someone but it is in the fired list, be careful


[21-Mar-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
@RAMMGaming because he was literally telling someone to kill themselves, I saw that as something that is not okay and I’ve seen people get fired for that in the past.


[21-Mar-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
But if you want to give him his rank back your choice.


[21-Mar-20 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
We legit fired an MR for saying she was going to kill herself, but having someone else tell you you should kill yourself is worse. I fired because that is just not okay at all in my book.


[21-Mar-20 03:32 PM] emma;#1525

[21-Mar-20 05:30 PM] Polk#1596
The *true* investigation team (consisting of me) have concluded that only a public execution would be fitting for this incident. Any objections? @emma;


[21-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
cuz i was bored


[21-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525

@Beartikal @babymariobebe LOL


[21-Mar-20 06:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
why do you have an LR helping, ik its ava but im pretty sure we agree LRs arent supposed to use btools anymore


[21-Mar-20 06:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma;


[21-Mar-20 06:49 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn bc i talked it over with stacey and since Ava has literally more building experience then most of the MRs helping and we're super behind i made an exception


[21-Mar-20 06:49 PM] emma;#1525
ive known ava for 3 years, this isn't like when loui (a stranger) was allowed to help and abused


[21-Mar-20 06:49 PM] emma;#1525
and all of the MRs know her and were fine with it


[21-Mar-20 06:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
wait


[21-Mar-20 06:50 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
wtf


[21-Mar-20 06:50 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
wtf


[21-Mar-20 06:50 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
why ava???????????


[21-Mar-20 06:50 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
?????????


[21-Mar-20 06:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
mk well you do know that LRs are gonna see it as bias right


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn you literally rejoined to run around with a tractor after i asked you THREE TIMES not to?


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] emma;#1525
and you want me to listen to your opinions?


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
o


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
🍵


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] emma;#1525
I really don't care how other LRs see it, i'm trying to get a session done in time. We've been building for 3 hours now


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ram u should be mr yatch @RAMMGaming


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] emma;#1525
And I asked you multiple times not to be running around in a tractor but you're literally doing it to piss me off at this point


[21-Mar-20 06:51 PM] emma;#1525
This is not good BOD behavior, I'd be more concerned about that then LRs seeing another LR help with a session


[21-Mar-20 06:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
im literally driving the tractor where nobody else is building


[21-Mar-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
that doesnt change thet fact that i asked you IN FRONT OF mrs multiple times not to


[21-Mar-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
and you're doing it anyways


[21-Mar-20 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xAfroTrey if someone makes a talkative role request and they haven't verified I recommend u just close the ticket with the note to verify


[21-Mar-20 06:53 PM] emma;#1525
that's not the image i really want them to be seeing, that we ignore what we ask of each other


[21-Mar-20 06:55 PM] xM_inn#2821
Right I'll stop then if having fun is such a problem nowadays.

FRICK!


[21-Mar-20 06:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i thought everyone did


[21-Mar-20 06:57 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn You're being so immature right now but I'll explain anyways, not that I'm sure you'll listen


[21-Mar-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Uh Minn-


[21-Mar-20 06:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No offense, but that was kind of unnecessary.


[21-Mar-20 06:57 PM] emma;#1525
I asked you multiple times not to drive tractors around, then you took it further by doing more distracting things, then you LEFT when I confronted you and had attitude towards me because I was upset that you literally were acting like a child.


[21-Mar-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
Then you COME BACK and start doing what I asked you to do AGAIN under the excuse "No one can see it!" even though it was literally the first thing I saw when I rejoined.


[21-Mar-20 06:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Rule 5


[21-Mar-20 06:58 PM] emma;#1525
If you aren't mature enough to understand that you're acting like you're a 12 year old who can't be respectful or take ownership of their actions then don't bother staying for the session because I'm literally not here for it right now, especially after the talk we had a few days ago.


[21-Mar-20 06:59 PM] emma;#1525
And that's that.


[21-Mar-20 06:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm so glad none of u never come to my sessions, damn u would get mad 😳


[21-Mar-20 06:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's not a good thing-


[21-Mar-20 06:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Unless there's something I'm missing


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
The point your missing is that we should be able to have fun. @xAfroTrey


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
ya know what my favorite part of a themed session is


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Minn, she asked you not to do something but you did it anyways.


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well except for the 3 cranky people a session everyone seems to have fun including me so I'd say it's a good thing


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
all the LRs constantly joining until its unslocked


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Your best bet really is to probably listen, just saying.


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
@xM_inn dms for a sec


[21-Mar-20 07:00 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not yours.


[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i save it forever


[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
Having fun during a SESSION is different then being distracting after we've spent 3 hours trying to build this thing and it's literally not goign to be done.


[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
If you want to run around having fun and admin abusing after we've finished building then I literally cannot stop you because you have more power than me, congratulations


[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah i agree with emma here


[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] emma;#1525
The least you can do is be respectful towards me as I'm building something I've been planning for a week


[21-Mar-20 07:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Also, you need to respond to stuff way better than you have recently.


[21-Mar-20 07:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I know this is kind of unrelated but please look at the Alloe proof Bliss sent you. @xM_inn


[21-Mar-20 07:02 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he said it wasnt enough


[21-Mar-20 07:02 PM] emma;#1525
Everyone else is having fun building because they're being respectful and productive, or at least not getting in people's way and being a distraction so don't blame me for "not being fun" when legit everyone else is having fun


[21-Mar-20 07:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
@xAfroTrey I did look at the proof and I gave my opinion.

[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Alright, so what do we do now?


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
idk :shrug:


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can't just have some kind of loophole with her.


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] Polk#1596
i have a question @emma;


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
Yes


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] Polk#1596
how is it so distracting to be driving a tractor when evreyone is so focused building


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] Polk#1596
like ok yeah


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] Polk#1596
when i got flung into fraux


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] Polk#1596
and he got flung


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] Polk#1596
i get that


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah theres really no reason to hold back her promo just bc we SUSPECT her of being a cb


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
The tractor was the start, it was the gateway to you guys throwing lasers around at each other and glitching


[21-Mar-20 07:03 PM] emma;#1525
So I'd prefer not to let you guys do that again


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and everyone is just joining the band wagon in calling her a cb


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] Polk#1596
but what is so distracting about just being in the background


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
And it's more the fact that I asked you to stop and neither of you had the respect to do that


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Polk, there's more.


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] Polk#1596
DREW SHOT ME


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] Polk#1596
THATS WHY I WAS GLITCHED


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well the thing is, its very distracting for builders if they want to join in and laugh at whatever is going on


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] emma;#1525
LIke that hurts because I expect you guys to be respectful of me on this team and y'all are trying to make it my fault that you were doing the opposite of what I asked


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@emma; thers a crack in the floor idk if its supposed to be there tho


[21-Mar-20 07:04 PM] Polk#1596
well ok, but i dont see the difference between someone messing around in the background and someone building in the background


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] Polk#1596
its not like we are hurting their eyes by being in the background


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
This is legit why I've considered resigning because sometimes you guys just don't care about respect because you're too busy being "funny" or "joking around" and then it's suddenly my fault when I want to get stuff done on time in a somewhat professional manner


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm going to have to agree with Emma here.


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
That doesn't matte Polk I asked you to stop at MY session and you should have the common decency to respect that


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
same trey


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Same


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] Polk#1596
yea thats why we left


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Plus, looking at what we have so far, it seems like a lot of work.


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i mean i get messing around a bit during the session but builders can get rly distracted


[21-Mar-20 07:05 PM] a. ღ#4222
emma i listen to all ur opinions and try to respect u pls no resign


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
and this boat is fucking huge bro so its going to take a lot of work


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
same storyyy


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
Idc if you guys want to stay and joke around and sit at the tables and pretend to serve food I legit just can't handle the admin abuse right now


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] Polk#1596
but i still dont understand why it is so bad about being in the background


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ill come and try to help


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
I ASKED YOU TO STOP


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
AND YOU DIDNT RESPECT ME


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
THAT'S WHAT'S BAD POLK


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
That is the OPPOSITE of what a team is


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] Polk#1596
yes but why did u ask us to stop then


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank (totally not stealing idea from firestone departments) what do u think about having a poll in discord sever for lrs to say who they approve and disapprove as a hr. E.g

Do you approve bonnie591 as bod

Then u add reactions


What do u think

{Reactions}
thumbs_up thumbs_down (6) 

[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's kind of a simple concept.


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] emma;#1525
I asked you to stop 3 times


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] Polk#1596
yes but why did u ask us to stop


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] Polk#1596
thats what im curious about


[21-Mar-20 07:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
.


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
Because it was distracting, the builders VC was all talking about that instead of building, they said it was annoying, they were complainign


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
um


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Polk, she said the reason above.


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
no


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Polk dmss


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
All 10 people in the VC agreed it was distracting


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
And I don't want them to have to work with that


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
@¢. ღ I'll talk to BODs about Alloe being promoted. If we agree, you can promote. If we disagree, you can't promote.


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xM_inn#2821
That why you have a good variety of opinions.


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@bonnie591 can u explain what u mean bc im confused


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
She has 6 votes-


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
theres no proof of her beinga  cb


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ok but theres no reason to hold back her promo just saying


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
It's not a good variety if it's only BODs considering non-BODs are the ones who did most of the communicating with her but okay


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] emma;#1525
I'm clearly not in Minn's good side rn so


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And plus, we've been at this for 3 months.


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] Polk#1596
ok fine, but if it were me i wouldnt be that easily distracted seeing someone 500 meters in the background messing around


[21-Mar-20 07:07 PM] Polk#1596
but im not going to argue


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
Well this isn't about you POlk


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
Sorry


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
I'll do what you ask at your session


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
And you can do what I ask at mine


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Either promote the girl or probably face somewhat of backlash.


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
And it won't be a problem

I'm not trying to make this a threat but like.


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
whats wrong with alloe


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] emma;#1525
NOw I've spent 20 minutes arguing about this instead of helping them figure out this damn boat so bye


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
people think shes a cb


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
even tho


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
theres no proof


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
i thought she did something bad


[21-Mar-20 07:08 PM] Cooqkie#2809
y do ppl think shes a cb though


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so basically people spread rumors lmao


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And plus, I'm pretty sure she's been cooperative when Bliss asked so.


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
we cant just listen to that


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
like ok if shes a cb then we will at least get proof lol


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If she's promoted and she's a CB-


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
goddamint bliss


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but rn we dont have proof so


[21-Mar-20 07:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
just my opinion


[21-Mar-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Honestly, it's kind of time to stop being paranoid with her and just go through with it.


[21-Mar-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Cause it's not really doing us favors to be honest.


[21-Mar-20 07:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[21-Mar-20 07:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
if shes a cb, we get proof, fire her


[21-Mar-20 07:10 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
the end


[21-Mar-20 07:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's kind of a simple concept, really.


[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah


[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And plus, the agreements so far pretty much outweigh the disagreements.


[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
@¢. ღ you may promote alloe


[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
we are gonna get backlash if we promote her and we are gonna get backlash if we dont promote her. its gonna happen either way so why not just go thro with the promo


[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
no


[21-Mar-20 07:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

how do u want to announce it tho


[21-Mar-20 07:21 PM] emma;#1525
I was thinking of having a "Yacht Outfit" contest for the MRs only


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
and he could win it and we'll be like "His prize is a promo!"


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
something liek that


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
or we can make tate the cruise director


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
like when all LRs are kicked?


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
and then be like "Tate did such a great job as cruise director we're going to promote him to cruise manager! And Bloxton Manager!!"


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
I like that idea


[21-Mar-20 07:22 PM] emma;#1525
no i just dont want a costume contest to take 3 years so it would be like 5 MRs


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey which do you think is better, the cruise director thing or the outfit contest thing


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
cruise director


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] bman#0435
^


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
when LRs there


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
emma are u getting a million dms about when the server is opening


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] bman#0435
that would just be a rigged outfit competition for the outfit lol


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
cause im getting annoyed with people rn


[21-Mar-20 07:23 PM] bman#0435
im getting some too for some reason


[21-Mar-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; I have an idea


[21-Mar-20 07:25 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey ?


[21-Mar-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
so after the training is done


[21-Mar-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
if there is even trainees


[21-Mar-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
whenever you do games


[21-Mar-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
you could say tate will lead one game


[21-Mar-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
and after that game is done


[21-Mar-20 07:26 PM] stacey#1000
you can say he did a good job directing the game, and promoting him to cruise manager


[21-Mar-20 07:30 PM] emma;#1525

and didnt try


[21-Mar-20 08:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
I did something like this last year in August, thought I'd do another one this year.


[21-Mar-20 08:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
and she said u said she didnt need to use grammar so she could fail the test and just party


[21-Mar-20 08:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
but i feel like


[21-Mar-20 08:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
she was being kinda disrespectful to the helper


[21-Mar-20 08:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
id suspend but like idk if theres a miscommunication so


[21-Mar-20 08:34 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie i told her it was ok if she failed right away but i didnt tell her to be rude OR troll


[21-Mar-20 08:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
if u said that then ill just warn


[21-Mar-20 08:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
o


[21-Mar-20 08:34 PM] emma;#1525
bc i knew she didnt want to actually train .-. so i didnt want to put up with her complaining


[21-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
but if she was being rude thats not ok


[21-Mar-20 08:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
can u check her logs to see if she needs a suspension


[21-Mar-20 08:35 PM] Cooqkie#2809
ya she was being kinda rude


[21-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525

[22-Mar-20 12:57 PM] emma;#1525
the fact that we all went from loving saab last time she was an MR to not being able to stand her behavior is amazing and gives me life


[22-Mar-20 12:57 PM] bman#0435
@¢. ღ how does it feel to be part of her daily ping? 💀


[22-Mar-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
@emma; well tbh i never knew how to view her in a different perspective other than an influence since i was always a lower rank


[22-Mar-20 12:58 PM] bman#0435
now that im a higher rank than her it changed


[22-Mar-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
we were pretty close once upon a time and good friends

but she's legit become sooooo self centered


[22-Mar-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
i think all the attention got to her head


[22-Mar-20 12:58 PM] emma;#1525
and she sees herself as this amazing staff member bc she used to be a senior and is good friends with baby and bear

the whole manager requirements thing always confused me


[22-Mar-20 02:23 PM] bman#0435
we dont even keep track of that


[22-Mar-20 02:24 PM] bman#0435
its just something to get them more active lmao


[22-Mar-20 02:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
Omg


[22-Mar-20 02:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
I didn’t know that


[22-Mar-20 02:24 PM] a. ღ#4222
Ok well


[22-Mar-20 02:26 PM] emma;#1525
no there are legit requirements


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
like we had a set number of shifts and sessions they were expected to attend


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
im pretty sure no one remembers them anymore tho


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] bman#0435
we dont keep track of that tho


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
ya bc no one cares


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
it would be nice tho to give them some sort of guideline


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
so they dont think they have to do 6 sessions a week to be considered active


[22-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525
when in reality i think its 3?


[22-Mar-20 02:28 PM] emma;#1525
maybe 2


[22-Mar-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
sum like that lol


[22-Mar-20 02:37 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey yo remember when we used to have people named 1x1x1x1xx


[22-Mar-20 02:37 PM] emma;#1525

[22-Mar-20 02:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[22-Mar-20 02:37 PM] emma;#1525
bc i have one that passed my ints and i remember that name being not good

@High Rank We are currently at 30 suspension/demotion requests, 400+ bans at the hotel, and 10+ warnings on the Management Board. If someone would like to help me clean up, that would be great. Thanks!

[22-Mar-20 05:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[22-Mar-20 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
I can host a banning session again tomorrow if it's still bad.


[22-Mar-20 05:47 PM] stacey#1000
The board has been overflowing fast recently.


[22-Mar-20 05:47 PM] xM_inn#2821

Like, Emma just hosted a banning session on Friday.


[22-Mar-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's growing quite fast.


[22-Mar-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
Within 1-2 days it's overflow.


[22-Mar-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
I really think a new shift manager wouldn't hurt.


[22-Mar-20 05:48 PM] stacey#1000
Just saying.


[22-Mar-20 05:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Pretty sure it's because everyone is out due to the coronavirus.


[22-Mar-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No, it's not. Not to be rude, but at least take it seriously for a bit. @bman


[22-Mar-20 05:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
(god that sounds like jack, but you get my point)

[22-Mar-20 05:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
we havent had a new one in a while


[22-Mar-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
I really think we need it, and you cannot keep saying the training schedule is a reason we don;t need one.


[22-Mar-20 05:50 PM] bman#0435
ya i agree now


[22-Mar-20 05:50 PM] xM_inn#2821

[22-Mar-20 05:50 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Mar-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank OK so came across this issue where Maddqy asked to host my 5th server, ended up not going to it, and I had to spam her to get her online; it didn't work. She started the session 20 minutes later than scheduled and I had to have Story attempt and start it for you. Draw any consequences for this...?


[22-Mar-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
did you even bother to ask her why she was late???


[22-Mar-20 07:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^^


[22-Mar-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
yes


[22-Mar-20 07:21 PM] bman#0435
she said "dev stuff"


[22-Mar-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003
why


[22-Mar-20 07:21 PM] ethan;#0003

[22-Mar-20 07:22 PM] a. ღ#4222

[22-Mar-20 07:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think we should technically punish her


[22-Mar-20 07:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
seems a bit too much


[22-Mar-20 07:22 PM] bman#0435
she started a session 20 minutes late...


[22-Mar-20 07:22 PM] ethan;#0003

cinderToday at 1:30 AM
when i look back and think about it i feel bad for myself ahaha, when i first joined Hilton all i wanted was 2 be accepted. i finaly found a group that accepted my sexuality, that shocked me because i was bullied out of school at the age of 13 based on my sexuality, i joined and started 2 kno ppl, kayla promoted me, i was shocked, 2 months later i got management, i made friends with matt, our friendship progressed, we voicecalled every night, every day, idk what we had was special, but at that age idk how 2 explain it, he was a lot older than me, he was grooming me in a way, trying 2 make me do stuff i didnt want 2 do, i was blidn 2 it back then tho, then i was sick i wasnt on all day, i woke up with a dm from trey saying hes demoting me ect i cant appeal im blacklisted whatever, i messaged jaced who was a general manager and she said hes mistaken, she dmd him he still claimed it was me without ANY proof. trey then lied 2 jack saying he suspended me, even tho he didnt. trey blocked me and banned me from the server, ages goes by and i dm trey asking for proof of everything ive done, apologizing 2 him ect, (i made a new discord acc) no response. i dmd a BOD and they said they would look into it, then they didn't reply since. i wasted a long period of my life working for what. he refuses 2 tell me what i actually did, and admit hes wrong. its funny looking back, idk how i was so hurt over a roblox game


[23-Mar-20 01:34 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

Agree: I see him at hotels shifts and at sessions.
Disagree: Inactivity.

[24-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Can we just get rid of the former mr role


[24-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Just so all these formers stop bitching about it


[24-Mar-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Who complained lol


[24-Mar-20 12:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What is even going on anyways @ethan;


[24-Mar-20 12:37 PM] ethan;#0003
Apple fairy bitching about appealing her former role


[24-Mar-20 12:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What did she say


[24-Mar-20 12:39 PM] bman#0435
^


[24-Mar-20 12:39 PM] bman#0435
we shouldnt remove the role because someone is annoying u for it


[24-Mar-20 12:39 PM] bman#0435
a bunch of people have it now and deserve it and removing it would just anger them


[24-Mar-20 12:40 PM] bman#0435
former mr role, in my eyes, is a way to recognize they were an mr and were actually dedicated to thwir jobs here


[24-Mar-20 12:40 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
True, but there are points where they just outright don't deserve the role.


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
im saying in regards to removing the role entirely


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
not just a single person


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
O


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
since ethan wants the role removed


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
as he said


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] bman#0435
lol


[24-Mar-20 12:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I misread your sentence mb lol


[24-Mar-20 12:42 PM] bman#0435
i was basically saying that because one person is bitching about it the other former mrs with the role shouldnt get their role removed too


[24-Mar-20 12:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here's the thing Ethan, we're mainly going off what they're providing for their appeal. @ethan;


[24-Mar-20 12:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I've pretty much explained why it wasn't very good, lol.


[24-Mar-20 01:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Have they pestered you at all or pressured you in any way?


[24-Mar-20 01:20 PM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming LMFAO HE CUFF ABUSED ON HIS ALT RIGHT AWAY


[24-Mar-20 01:20 PM] bman#0435
https://trello.com/c/LNOUDrVi/32523-ryanwyd-6-cuff-abuse


[24-Mar-20 01:25 PM] ethan;#0003
I’m just saying that there is so much unnecessary  drama that happened in the past over the role


[24-Mar-20 01:25 PM] ethan;#0003
And it’s bound to happen again


[24-Mar-20 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
And if the role isn’t there their can’t be drama over it


[24-Mar-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435
then whoever starts the drama can be blacklisted from it


[24-Mar-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[24-Mar-20 01:26 PM] ethan;#0003
So 75% of formers?


[24-Mar-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435
75% of formers probably aren't in the server


[24-Mar-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
lol


[24-Mar-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's usually their problems, not our fault.


[24-Mar-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
^


[24-Mar-20 01:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And removing the role entirely is punishing the ones who didn't do any of that for no reason.


[24-Mar-20 01:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's not going to solve our problems, it's going to worsen it.


[24-Mar-20 01:41 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@bman I saw i say fire


[24-Mar-20 01:42 PM] bman#0435
wut


[24-Mar-20 01:43 PM] emma;#1525
Oh god I don’t even want to think of the shit we’d go through if we removed the former role lmao


[24-Mar-20 01:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

@High Rank Question: Should we remove omarzarur's promotion blacklist and promote him to head?

Even though he did something rlly bad 2 years ago, he has 1700+ reports and even today continues to be active and has stuck with us. Thoughts?

The only thing I'm concerned about is his relation to Pxrpleyy and her crew when she was a thing. Otherwise, I agree. He's an MR at SizzleBurger too.


[25-Mar-20 07:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Wasnt there a recent incident with candy kenzi and claire


[25-Mar-20 07:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Even tho it shud be long ago stuff


[25-Mar-20 07:15 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[25-Mar-20 09:17 AM] emma;#1525
Why can’t we promote LRs who haven’t been blacklisted instead of literally just repromoting formers like it feels we have been lately


[25-Mar-20 09:17 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye im just scared that hes like zippy

If there's no appeals being mentioned in the comments of the card, it's a good chance they're not coming back


[25-Mar-20 11:10 AM] bman#0435
since when can you appeal a promotion blacklist


[25-Mar-20 11:10 AM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming rmaam


[25-Mar-20 11:10 AM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 11:18 AM] stacey#1000
Where’s suspend option or idk yet option


[25-Mar-20 11:18 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't want us to make quick decisions like Emma said


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
Plus


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
We should question her about it first


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll start asking on what this was about


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^^


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
Question her about it


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] RAMMGaming#3022

I need to ask her about it first


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah do that


[25-Mar-20 11:19 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then we'll go from there

Oh


[25-Mar-20 11:52 AM] bman#0435
@stacey @xAfroTrey ^^


[25-Mar-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
what


[25-Mar-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
o


[25-Mar-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
so she sent it because someone asked for a CB list


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
but thats not one she should send


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
maybe she didnt know


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
he even said cam said there wasnt one


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
@bman didnt another MR make a CB lsit to send to people or something


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
its pretty obvious not to leak any links in that-


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
no


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
that was vac


[25-Mar-20 11:53 AM] bman#0435
but i made him dleete it


[25-Mar-20 11:54 AM] stacey#1000
o


[25-Mar-20 11:54 AM] bman#0435
because he literally copied andbpasted my doc


[25-Mar-20 11:54 AM] stacey#1000
he asked me if there was a CB list


[25-Mar-20 11:54 AM] stacey#1000
and I didnt reply


[25-Mar-20 11:54 AM] stacey#1000
because I forgot


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
Maybe stop making a CB list available to MRs if it keeps getting leaked


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Then how are they going to track hem down?


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
true


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
so


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
did you question her


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
By the way, I'm waiting for Farra's reply.


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
o


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
ok lets wait for her reply


[25-Mar-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
before deciding anything


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
ye


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] bman#0435
its helpful to them


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] bman#0435
they just literally need to use their brains


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] stacey#1000
and when u announce


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] stacey#1000
you put not to leak it too


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] stacey#1000
so


[25-Mar-20 11:56 AM] bman#0435
its obvious no to leak anything in mr announcements


[25-Mar-20 11:57 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[25-Mar-20 01:28 PM] emma;#1525
Which is scary


[25-Mar-20 01:29 PM] emma;#1525
It’s defo at least a suspension bc I think that’s what we’ve done for instances like this before? Unless someone remembers differently


[25-Mar-20 01:29 PM] stacey#1000

[25-Mar-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435
i dont feel comfortable with omar being an mr because ik he hates me for no reason and can be disrespectful but ik i cant do anything abt that


[25-Mar-20 03:20 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t like how we’ve rehired past blacklisted MRs just to have to fire them for doing the same things we all claimed they’d changed for


[25-Mar-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435
he also came back with olivia but yikes


[25-Mar-20 03:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
didnt he hint and be like "if im not getting promoted ill quit again"


[25-Mar-20 03:21 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
something like that


[25-Mar-20 03:21 PM] bman#0435
we could have at least have him "appeal" his blacklist instead of just archiving it


[25-Mar-20 03:21 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think omar deserves a chance but thats just my opinion


[25-Mar-20 03:21 PM] bman#0435
we should make sure he is aware of what he did and that he wont do it again...

[25-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 03:23 PM] bman#0435

claire and kenzi leaked


[25-Mar-20 03:24 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 03:25 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 03:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Of them actually telling them btw


[25-Mar-20 03:27 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think the promotion channel is stupid ✌️


[25-Mar-20 03:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ok so


[25-Mar-20 03:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[25-Mar-20 03:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
omar thought that


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
she was talking about the senior board ig


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
lol


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but claire


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
isnt even a senior


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so that doesnt


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
make sense


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's because Mark leaked it


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] bman#0435
hes def not getting promoted if hes telling other what mark leaked to him


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] bman#0435
lfmao


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah but


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] bman#0435
can we bring back his promo blacklist and make him appeal it? 🙄


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] bman#0435
its called a blacklist for a reason


[25-Mar-20 03:28 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
claire probably leaked but theres no proof


[25-Mar-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435
then question her lol


[25-Mar-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435
u wont have much to question her about tho


[25-Mar-20 03:29 PM] bman#0435
so


[25-Mar-20 03:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah i dont even know what to say


[25-Mar-20 03:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

There's no proof against it


[25-Mar-20 03:30 PM] bman#0435
exactly


[25-Mar-20 03:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I don't think the channels would help with our point of leaking


[25-Mar-20 03:30 PM] bman#0435
thats why i said


[25-Mar-20 03:30 PM] bman#0435
"u wont have much to question her about tho"

[25-Mar-20 03:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But what are the questions gonna be


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
thats for bliss to ask if he really wants to investigate her'


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
;lol


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If there's no amount of proof during the questioning, it's gonna be a lot of nothing


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
trey


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
bliss said she possibly leaked


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
so i told him to question her if he wants but there wont be much to question her about


[25-Mar-20 03:32 PM] bman#0435
ur literally agreeing and disagreeing with me


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well someone had to tell him about the promotion suggestions channel


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
we will find out eventually


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
well its been there for a few months now


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] bman#0435
wouldnt be surprised if a few formers did


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
they said he was suggested doe


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The best thing we can do the most is not really promote him


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[25-Mar-20 03:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Or them at the same time


[25-Mar-20 03:34 PM] bman#0435
@bonnie591 can i unarchive his promo blacklist, and this time he has to appeal it? he clearly isnt demonstrating the behavior of a potential mr if he wants to keep repeating leaked information or talk about some small information a management may have leaked


[25-Mar-20 03:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
he tried appealing to me


[25-Mar-20 03:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
but yall told me


[25-Mar-20 03:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
he had nothing to sppeal


[25-Mar-20 03:34 PM] a. ღ#4222
so


[25-Mar-20 03:35 PM] emma;#1525
Why was it archived in the first place


[25-Mar-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean


[25-Mar-20 03:35 PM] bman#0435
well if we want to give him a chance then we should have him appeal instead of archiving for no reason


[25-Mar-20 03:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was mainly evidence of him doing this in V5


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah then after we decide that he might be suitable we voted to remove or keep it


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
but now he just fucked himself over again


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
lmao


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
So now what


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Do we just have him promo blacklisted or have him wait longer


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i mean he basically hinted so


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[25-Mar-20 03:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think maybe this time


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
"ill quit if the card gets archived" bc he still thinks its on the senior board


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It won't be permanent


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
^


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah that sounds better


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But it'll be 1 month of holding his promotion back


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
makes me uncomfy that someone told him about the promo suggestions channel tho and he wont tell us who


[25-Mar-20 03:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Here's the thing bliss


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If we do it now


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
or we just unarchive and he can appeal lol


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can see how his behavior progresses


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
true


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
he isnt even supposed to know that he was promo blacklisted


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
clearly hasnt changed a bit since 2018


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
he somehow knows


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that'll give it away @bman


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
from mark


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah bc mark leaked it


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
or mia


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
one of them told him


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
LOL MIA


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
it was def mark


[25-Mar-20 03:38 PM] bman#0435
so he knows


[25-Mar-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mark leaked the fact that Bonnie told the seniors he cannot progress in promotion


[25-Mar-20 03:39 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
mhm


[25-Mar-20 03:39 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think he did an educated guess on us having a promo blacklist

how does he behave compared to that incident


[25-Mar-20 04:44 PM] bman#0435
he seems way more professional and mature


[25-Mar-20 04:45 PM] bman#0435
and he submits a good amount of reports


[25-Mar-20 04:45 PM] bman#0435
and is seen around frequently


[25-Mar-20 04:45 PM] bman#0435
so


[25-Mar-20 04:46 PM] emma;#1525
when tf did sowbex even come back


[25-Mar-20 04:46 PM] bman#0435
tbh idk


[25-Mar-20 04:46 PM] bman#0435
ive seen him for like a month or 2 now


[25-Mar-20 04:46 PM] a. ღ#4222
was he fired


[25-Mar-20 04:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no


[25-Mar-20 04:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he left the group


[25-Mar-20 04:48 PM] emma;#1525
so he's only been active for "a month or 2"


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's technically enough though


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] bman#0435
lol


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg wow what a sight to see, no one needs to be ranked on passer section on senior board


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
yeah but is it enough to make us actually want to promote lol


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
besides my session


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] bman#0435
i just ranked them bloo


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] bman#0435
lol


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh-


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lma


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lmao


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
idk when people have rocky pasts i'd prefer to give them more than the minimum amount of time


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] emma;#1525
personally


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well still a sight to see


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] bman#0435
i mean bonnie put omar up and i dont even think its been a month for him


[25-Mar-20 04:49 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what is your option to define that @emma;


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
may have been just over a month


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
not sure


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
if sowbex's issues did stem from not being promoted, then promoting him after one month isn't really gonna let us see if he's changed


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
but i know he came back recently


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
is omar blacklisted or not


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
im so confused


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
i thought he was but people are saying he isnt


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
bonnie archived but never messaged back about unarchiving


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was promotion blacklisted, not an actual blacklist


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
i dont like how we unarchived with nothing else


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
so he archived after we all said... we didnt want him unblacklisted...?


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] bman#0435
like no appeal or anything


[25-Mar-20 04:50 PM] emma;#1525
@bonnie591 da heck


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's the difficult thing though


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
his actions were two years ago


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
i dont like how he immediately goes up for a promo seconds after his blacklist gets taken down


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he wasn't blacklisted but


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
SO OMAR HAS BEEN FIRED TWICE


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was clearly fired and suspended in v5


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
which clearly shows he doesnt know how to grow


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
AND HE'S BEING RECOMMENDED FOR A PROMO


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
are you kidding me


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
3 times


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
fired once, okay


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
c:


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
FIRED TWICE?


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
no


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
sorry


[25-Mar-20 04:51 PM] emma;#1525
no


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] ethan;#0003
I threw up and fell asleep for@7 hours -_-


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
some people dont deserve more chances


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
the fact he was blacklisted


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
lol


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
he can go work at sizzleburger


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
CORONAAAAA @ethan;


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
they like people who break rules


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
and leaks what mark leaked to him


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think my main problem with him is


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he keeps fishing for a promotion and his questions really show


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] ethan;#0003
I just woke up at 5:50


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] emma;#1525
he passed his application on feb 2nd


[25-Mar-20 04:52 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's over a month though


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] bman#0435
omar?


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] bman#0435
or sow


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
that's just his app


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
idk when he passed training


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] emma;#1525
omar


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was never a former mr either so it's technically an appropriate amount of time of people of his position for a promotion


[25-Mar-20 04:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
however


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
he was fired two times


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
How the fuck did he get best security if he's so new


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the way he's handling this was not good


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
TWO TIMES


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
and he's leaking what mark told him


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
that shows he cant be trusted


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
bc he knows he shouldnt be spreading that around


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
since he used to be an MR


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
and if claire and kenzi are potentially leaking to him too, we need to investigate that before we even look at omar for a promo


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
there's a perfect medley of reasons why we should not be promoting omar right now


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but we're not really thinking of that


[25-Mar-20 04:54 PM] emma;#1525
and he still got unblacklisted??


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] bman#0435
omar attended my interviews with olivia and my trainings tho


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i said this before but like


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
@bman when did he attend your interviews


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] bman#0435
like a month ago or a bit longer


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
interesting


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
bc he defo passed an application on feb 2nd


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i said that he should be taken off permanent but receive at last a month for pestering and fishing for answers


[25-Mar-20 04:55 PM] emma;#1525
so i wonder if he resigned and came back


[25-Mar-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
not to mention


[25-Mar-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i did point out that the best thing to do is to simply not promote the three of them at the moment


[25-Mar-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525
the three being omar claire and kenzi?


[25-Mar-20 04:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mhm


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
Lmao Olivia randomly joined me at the hotel when I forgot my join was on and said hi then left before I could talk to her. Never unblocking her


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but probably for a temporary amount of time and see how it progresses


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's why


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
ok when y'all are talking about "olivia" do you mean xcroustillant


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
that olivia


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
oliv6s


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
Ya


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
ok


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
just making sure lol


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can see how omar behaves for that month and see if proof surfaces for candy and kezni


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kenzi*


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
She’s the one that complained to be directly about Omar never being promoted and how Darren got senior


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
kind of like what we did to alloe


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
So I blocked her


[25-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
proof isnt going to surface if we dont go looking for it trey


[25-Mar-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and we defo didnt want for proof to surface for alloe lmao tf we looked hard for it


[25-Mar-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and after 3-4 months we found nothing solid


[25-Mar-20 04:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i feel like this may be a repeat though


[25-Mar-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
how is someone potentially being a cb and two MRs potentially leaking to someone the same thing at all


[25-Mar-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
and why is it better to not look into the leaking


[25-Mar-20 04:59 PM] bman#0435
theyre completely dif


[25-Mar-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
also why arent we discussing candy at all with this??


[25-Mar-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
since she's the one who potentially leaked the senior board to omar


[25-Mar-20 04:59 PM] bman#0435
candy wasnt a senior when he was on the board


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
so


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^^


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and plus


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
he's on the board right now


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mark told them senior info


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
isnt he


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
he hasnt been on the board since april of0


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
no


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
he was last on in april of 2019


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
then why tf are we even looking towards him at all


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
if none of the seniors have even recommended him


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
dont ask me lol


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] emma;#1525
and none of us even want to look at him


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
claire and kenzi arent seniors


[25-Mar-20 05:00 PM] bman#0435
but ok


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's very obvious that mark leaked to them


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt say they were bman


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
like at the time


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he did mention that he hoped that they don't archive him again


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] bman#0435
but they recommended him


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] bman#0435
and apparently claire told him


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
yeah and they're also obviously super close with him


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] bman#0435
that she suggested him


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
people recommend their friends before other people lmao how do you think saab slee and tate got MR so fast


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
because we're all "friends" with them


[25-Mar-20 05:01 PM] emma;#1525
or at least we were before we started not liking two of them LOL


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah but tate's route was a lot different lol


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
exactly lmao @emma;


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
here's hoping they can actually fix their behavior but like


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
nah they all got their head roles the same way, way too fast and as a result of bias


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
tate deserves management tho 100%


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
not trying to pull that away from him


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] emma;#1525
obviously i mean i promoted him lol


[25-Mar-20 05:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
saab and slee gotta work on their issues though lol


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my issues with saab is like


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
they arent getting it any time soon


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
we can all agree


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
lol


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
omg she acts like she is 14


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she is very insecure as a 23 yr old lol


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
but she's probably 24 by now


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
like


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
???


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
she acts younger than me but shes like double my age


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
i get not being mature all the time


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
.


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
.


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
.


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
but have you ever seen me tag someone and be like "Hi! Not gonna get a response, so bye."


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
??????????????????????????????????????/


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
NO BECAUSE THAT IS IMMATURE


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
and she does it all the time lol


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think the thing is about saab is


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
@emma; hi


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
she also will tag me after she's been afk even tho i wasnt talking to her and be like "Sorry was afk for dinner"


[25-Mar-20 05:03 PM] bman#0435
@emma; wow no response ok bye


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
last year, there wasn't much hrs to call out her bullshit


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
like ok i didnt ask i didnt want to know and i dont care


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
bye


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
well honestly i had no problems with her when she was a senior outside of the guest drama


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but now with us in employment


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
of which there were many problems


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
we can definitely do that


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
but she wasn't that bad when it came to BH


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she was inactive tho


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
now she's on the bottom of the MR food chain and i think that bothers her bc she's used to being baby and bear's bff who can get what she wants when she wants


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but only because she had a family emergency


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
i mean they've already told her info that they didnt even tell us


[25-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
but she's only a head of security so like she has 0 power


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ye


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
my main problem with slee is like


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
his ego is HUGE


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he plays around way too much too


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
like i think saab's ego is slightly too big but she's just insecure


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also uh


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
SLEE THINKS HE IS A GOD


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
WHO IS SO FUNNY


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
DOES NO WRONG


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
his activity isn't the most consistent


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
AND CAN BE A BULLY AND ITS HILARIOUS


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
slee pisses me off so much


[25-Mar-20 05:05 PM] emma;#1525
literally today


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
tate had problems with his toilet (wont go into details but its all in staff lounge)


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
that i guess he privately DMed tate about


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] bman#0435
LMFOAOOAOA


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
and slee POSTED IT ALL IN STAFF LOUNGE


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] bman#0435
HIS TOILET


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] bman#0435
BAHAAHA


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
and embarrased tate


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
ya he clogged it lol


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
and didnt know how to fix it


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] bman#0435
FAFAEOF


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
so slee told everyone in SL about it


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
so everyone was teasing him


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
was tate kind of pissed


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] bman#0435
so mature for a former hr


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
tate took it in stride tho and took us all on the journey


[25-Mar-20 05:06 PM] emma;#1525
nah i dont think tate cared that much lol he was asking everyone for advice


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
but then after it was fixed people were joking around that tate started drama and broke a rule bc of it


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think this is more humorous than an actual issue so far on what ur describing


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
and tate DMed me asking if they actually thought he caused drama and i said no ofc not they're messing around


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
and he dmed Slee the same thing


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
and slee posted THOSE dms too


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
showing everyone that tate thought they were actually mad at him


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
like bro wtf


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait so


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] emma;#1525
you have to leak everything tate says to you??


[25-Mar-20 05:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they had an issue because you contacted tate about it?


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
no no no


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
no one had an issue with me lol


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what was the trouble specifically


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
everyone in sl was like "omg tate broke the no drama rule bc he clogged his toilet!!!"


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
there was no trouble


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
tate just misunderstood


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
and thought people actually thought he broke a rule


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
so he checked with me and i was like no ur fine lmao they're teasing you bc you were dumb and clogged your toilet


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what rule exactly


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
sorry if i'm being a dumbass lol


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
the no starting drama rule


[25-Mar-20 05:08 PM] emma;#1525
trey no one was upset


[25-Mar-20 05:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok go on


[25-Mar-20 05:09 PM] emma;#1525
except ME BC SLEE KEPT PUBLICIZING EVERYTHING TATE SAID TO HIM IN PRIVATE


[25-Mar-20 05:09 PM] emma;#1525
like how does slee expect to keep friends if they cant tell him anything without becoming a spectacle for the MR team


[25-Mar-20 05:09 PM] emma;#1525
oh right bc he's a former HR who's friendship is a privilege


[25-Mar-20 05:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so wait


[25-Mar-20 05:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
the problem was slee basically sharing dms all the time


[25-Mar-20 05:11 PM] bman#0435
i wonder what slee and saab said in dms after tates management promo


[25-Mar-20 05:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe congratulated him considering they're good friends


[25-Mar-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they're close with one another but like


[25-Mar-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm sure they're salty given that they haven't been promoted yet


[25-Mar-20 05:12 PM] bman#0435
no i mean


[25-Mar-20 05:12 PM] bman#0435
to one another


[25-Mar-20 05:12 PM] bman#0435
saabs dms to slee


[25-Mar-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
probably expressing excitement for tate lol


[25-Mar-20 05:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
idk if it's just me but like


[25-Mar-20 05:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm not exactly seeing this as too important unless slee shared things on a more serious level


[25-Mar-20 05:14 PM] bman#0435
they def shit talked


[25-Mar-20 05:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[25-Mar-20 05:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
forgetting to clog a toilet?


[25-Mar-20 05:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[25-Mar-20 05:14 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 05:15 PM] bman#0435
he clogged it and didnt know how to unclog


[25-Mar-20 05:15 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 05:15 PM] bman#0435
forget to clog?


[25-Mar-20 05:15 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 05:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[25-Mar-20 05:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm still trying to wrap my head around how he forgets that


[25-Mar-20 05:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
but then again


[25-Mar-20 05:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
tate's younger than most of us sooo


[25-Mar-20 05:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
🤷‍♀️


[25-Mar-20 05:17 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
O really


[25-Mar-20 05:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well damn


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey trey i legit never said that slee needed to be in trouble


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
im saying hes annoying


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
and not mature


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok those two things i agree with lol


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
it wasnt that big of a deal but it was just stupid that slee embarrassed tate like that


[25-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
and defo doesnt help slee towards getting a promo


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was trying to figure out what you were annoyed from tho lol


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
i-


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
trey


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
ive said why i was annoyed 3 times


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] emma;#1525
but do you want me to say it again


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no i get it now lol


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] bman#0435
slees change in behavior lol


[25-Mar-20 05:25 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
slee's maturity has definitely decreased for sure


[25-Mar-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait i just realized


[25-Mar-20 05:26 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's always kind of immature when it comes to discussions about his friends


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
remember that one time when he was still an hr and we clashed over saab being ranked back to senior


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@emma;


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
oh yeah


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
y did she even get ranked back


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was kind of immature there and was kind of biased lol


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
bc baby and bear wanted to


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
ryan said she didnt resign


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] bman#0435
but she did


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
she did


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she did tho lol


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i guess that was the issue


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
her rank was removed


[25-Mar-20 05:27 PM] emma;#1525
and we thought it was said and done


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
but then ryan brought up a while later that she never sent in a resignation letter


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
or said she was resigning


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think baby and bear wanted to be really nice to her but it backfired lol


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
so basically we may have fucked up and taken her rank thinking she wanted to resign but she really didnt want to


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and the mrs gave us shit for it too lol


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and we literally said like


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
but we ended up finding either a resignation letter or a clear statement of "im resigning" (i forget which one)


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"no this was out of our control lol"


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] emma;#1525
so there was no reason to re-rank her bc she clearly resigned


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and it was a shitshow in general discussion too


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
When y’all wanted Saab back I was so pissed


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435
SAAB WAS SUSPENDED FOR LEAKING THE MB?


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] bman#0435
WTF


[25-Mar-20 05:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435
AND SHE WASNT FIRED FOR THAT


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435
WTFFFFFFF


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
and then later i think baby and bear ranked her back anyways


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
and we were all mad


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
times were a lot different back then bman lol


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
except for slee


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
ofc


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435
bruh


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
but we told baby and bear its not happening so she got terminated again


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
Bman u literally we happy Saab was gonna get senior back after she LEFT THE GROUP


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] a. ღ#4222

[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] a. ღ#4222

[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i was confused and pissed at the same time


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
Like I liked Saab but I found it u fair


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
Unfair


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] bman#0435
well i didnt wanna be rude


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah exactly


[25-Mar-20 05:29 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i mean i was decent friends with her too


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
everyone was so rude


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
and i felt bad for that


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
but i wasnt happy she was getting princess priority


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
so i tried acting


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
nice


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
lol


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
wait rude lol


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh yeah


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
yeah the MRs were piiiiissed


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
everyone was rude and confused to y she got senior back but none of their friends could come back


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
and i felt bad


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they were not happy and kind of rightfully so


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
i ended up talking to her about it, i mean it wasn't her fault at all


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
she didnt ask for it


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
to my knowledge


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
so i was trying to be nice and be like WELCOME BACK


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
i think baby and bear just gave it to her


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
so i did feel bad that she was attacked even though she had nothing to do with it


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
ryan knew tho


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
actually she did ask @emma;


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
he announced her coming back


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
oh


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
well


[25-Mar-20 05:30 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
they said yes


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] bman#0435
and said she never fully resigned


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
once we made the decision


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] bman#0435
but she had a full on letter


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] bman#0435
like


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
she was pretty immature


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
yeah thats why she was re-demoted


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] a. ღ#4222
I wasn’t like attacking her


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] a. ღ#4222
I just found it SUPER unfair


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

most people werent attacking *her* just the situation


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
bc ofc everyone knew how close she was with baby and bear


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
like everyone knew thats why she got ranked back


[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] bman#0435

[25-Mar-20 05:31 PM] emma;#1525
and no one was happy about it

**LETTER OF FRIENDSHIP TERMINATION**

Dear xAfroTrey,

From this day forward, beginning at 9:15 PM EST on March 25th, 2020, we will no longer be friends. This is simply because you are a **HUGE** asshole. I'm done with our friendship, it is so toxic and I can't deal with your fake ass anymore. Everyone deserves a second chance, but you're fresh out of chances! Goodbye, see you never.

Terrible regards,

blissuh

[25-Mar-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435
she was an mr


[25-Mar-20 08:26 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Thats the only bad part


[25-Mar-20 08:26 PM] bman#0435

k; ♡Today at 9:04 PM
A couple of LRs from Bloxton, including a former MR, has been extremely inappropriate alongside with her friend, and some of them and their friends have been trash talking a current MR. We’ve got screenshots of the stuff happening, and we made a group chat where we’d send all the evidence.

Also, they couldn’t stop with the harassing, me and couple of my friends decided to have like a thing between us and change usernames with the same ending, they on somehow found about it and they decided to steal the names such as creative multiple accounts with these names just because they hate us. I get this is just a username, but the fact that they did it on purpose just to hurt our feelings when we were literally trying our best just to get the necessary robux to support each other with. 

They also have been involved with many ODing situations and one of my friends have been added in one of their very inappropriate GC that includes very inappropriate stuff.
We just feel like bringing it up to HR's attention with this so we avoid drama and many more. Since they are also current staff members at Bloxton.

[25-Mar-20 08:27 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
He always had nerves


[25-Mar-20 08:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i agreed before all this shit happened


[25-Mar-20 08:27 PM] bman#0435
and why i want his blacklist to be unarchived


[25-Mar-20 08:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
hes also a restaurant manager at SB, better be careful


[25-Mar-20 08:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so he screwed himself over again


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
can we bring back his blacklist


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] emma;#1525
if he's an MR at SB then that's all he needs


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] emma;#1525
we can drop him


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] emma;#1525
buh bye


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
yes or no


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
or do we need a vote


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
i think its pretty clear everyone would vote yes on a vote


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] emma;#1525
I vote no we do not promote him right now


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
just bring it back


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
temporarily


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
for 3 month


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
and we'll reconsider then


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
he wont change


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
its obvious


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
its been 2 years


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Not gonna reconsider


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
and still hasnt changed a bit


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
lets just wait and see in 3 months


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
ok


[25-Mar-20 08:28 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Hes personality is shit


[25-Mar-20 08:29 PM] emma;#1525
if he's saying he's gonna quit if he's not promoted I say we test that theory


[25-Mar-20 08:29 PM] emma;#1525

[25-Mar-20 08:29 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OMAR*


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] stacey#1000
He would leak if he became an MR


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I feel he knows too much


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
maybe


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sometime in his career he would


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
but he'd have a lot to lose


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
And seeing that he is frens with olivia snake


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
he'd lose an MR position at Bloxton hes been waiting for 2 years for


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
and he'd lost his SB MR position


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] emma;#1525
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[25-Mar-20 08:30 PM] xM_inn#2821

@bman not really but did he get 5 votes...?


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
4 and perms from min


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] katie#0200
LMAOAOAO @xM_inn


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
whats the point of needing 5 votes if minn just approves everyone


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it seems like they're humiliating them in a way


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn can we go back to needing 5 votes


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
he doesnt


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
please


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] katie#0200
I SAW U MENTIONED SESSIONS AND I WAS LIKE I WANNA HOST TOO


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
sowbex was up for less than a day


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; what for


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
he approves 4 votes if he needs to


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] bman#0435
yes


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
i feel like people should be up waaaaay longer than one day


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Yikes formers


[25-Mar-20 08:35 PM] emma;#1525
before we promote them


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
literally half the HRs probably havent even seen his card yet


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
i mean kyle got 5 in less than an hour lol


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
yeah bc 5 HRs is like


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
10%


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I seen it but no bex


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i swear we really need to announce on group chatting reports lol


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
its always been 5 votes or approval from a BOD


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435
@PackItUpMack hes not a toxic former lol


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Just no


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Lol


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe just stick to 5 really


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
ik but i feel like we need to have a time minimum for a card to be on the HR board before it is approved


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
so that everyone has the chance to see it


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
like 24 hours


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
at least


[25-Mar-20 08:36 PM] emma;#1525
because what if cookie really has good reason to not promote sowbex


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
but you approved him 3 hours into his card beign up and cookie is busy all day


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
so he gets promoted but cookie had a great reason that woudla stopped him


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
ya know


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
rare chance


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
but like i feel like that needs to be a thing


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] bman#0435
@Cooqkie ^


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt even know sowbex was working for us again lol so that's also an issue if HRs dont realize people are even LRs and next thing you know they're being approved but you have good proof against them


[25-Mar-20 08:37 PM] emma;#1525
ITS THEORETICAL BMAN


[25-Mar-20 08:38 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie ignore bman


[25-Mar-20 08:38 PM] bman#0435
@Cooqkie ignore emma


[25-Mar-20 08:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
okay you all have 24 hours minimum to vote on a promotion opinion card


[25-Mar-20 08:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
but benson already has his promotion card approved


[25-Mar-20 08:38 PM] katie#0200
i wanna promote someone but idk who :cool_cry:


[25-Mar-20 08:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
@bman so u can still promote him


[25-Mar-20 08:39 PM] bman#0435
i like how on my shift card i got paragraphs but cam just gets his name :PartyGlasses:


[25-Mar-20 08:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
because benson is really good, same rank as me at SB, and he's done nothing but work hard


[25-Mar-20 08:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

@Beartikal anuxo is a child predator


[25-Mar-20 09:08 PM] emma;#1525
is that good enough


[25-Mar-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
hes a child himself so maybe thats not legit but he got exposed by a few of his former HRs for always asking them for inappropriate things and talking about sex


[25-Mar-20 09:09 PM] emma;#1525
so


[25-Mar-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal their interviewing process is horrible and their hrs and staff are toxic


[25-Mar-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
They are rude


[25-Mar-20 09:11 PM] ethan;#0003
They dont listen


[25-Mar-20 09:12 PM] emma;#1525
They've been releasing V2 for about 2 years now


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
The owner framed his vice chairman when a report came out by switching the rank names around to make it look like the vice chairman did these horrible things instead of anuxo


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey can u explain the experience we had at fizze interviewws


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
sure


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] emma;#1525
i got fired for inactivity from fizze even tho i'd been to a session that week lol


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
I had perfect grammar at interviews right


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
showed great detail in my answers


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
with paragraphs


[25-Mar-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
and yet


[25-Mar-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
failed for "lack of detail and short answers" when they dont even know the definition of lack of detail


[25-Mar-20 09:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Beartikal their owner has been promising the release of Fizze V2 since July 2019 and has constantly changed the date and it still hasnt been released


[25-Mar-20 09:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
He's also constantly advertising game passes and trying to get people to spend their robux in his announcements channel of his Discord


[25-Mar-20 09:14 PM] ethan;#0003
AND I GOT KICKED FROM INTERVIEWS FOR ASKING "WHY ARE THERE 6 PEOPLE SPECTATING AND ONLY 4 PEOPLE INTERVIEWING" WHEN THERE WAS 50 INTERVIEWEES


[25-Mar-20 09:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
working as an MR at fizze wasn't very fun lol


[25-Mar-20 09:15 PM] katie#0200
lol i got a written warning for missing one grammar mistake in an interviewees answers


[25-Mar-20 09:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
they warn for the smallest things lol


[25-Mar-20 09:17 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; OH I KNOW (probably) WHY because they basically free rank their MRs (it is so easy to pass their apps) but they require everyone to spectate an interview and training before they can participate


[25-Mar-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
It's so dumb lol like I know how interviews work and they made me sit through one just so I can see... that it's so easy...


[25-Mar-20 09:18 PM] emma;#1525
I don't think I ever spectated a training bc I was so done already


[25-Mar-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey not excited that MOODY was involved in that either lol


[25-Mar-20 09:19 PM] emma;#1525
literally whats the point of making a big gc to report people


[25-Mar-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
and then have only 2 people post evidence


[25-Mar-20 09:20 PM] emma;#1525
anyways

i like how the events resemble real life trampoline tho


[25-Mar-20 09:30 PM] emma;#1525
yeah but the actual way the trampoline jumps you is not great lol


[25-Mar-20 09:30 PM] emma;#1525
you like pause at the bottom for 2 seconds


[25-Mar-20 09:31 PM] emma;#1525
before it jumps you again


[25-Mar-20 09:31 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
@bman also ofc you'd pick the closest thing to a furry you can for cam's name


[26-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
is there a word for being a furry for an insect


[26-Mar-20 01:54 AM] a. ღ#4222
whats the exploit


[26-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
is there a reason i cant remove the nitro booster role from this predatory loser :)


[26-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525

[26-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
instead


[26-Mar-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
OMG IM NOT A FURRY UGH


[26-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
@a. ღ basically he has it so where if people delete or edit messages, he can see the original one for a longer time


[26-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
which would be really great for these girls to have had lol

[26-Mar-20 02:01 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wanna know how the discussion went lol @emma;


[26-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
he's denying so much but i already caught him in one lie so


[26-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
he doxxed and there's proof


[26-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
so i already fired and banned him


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
he's trying to justify talking to underage girls by saying he's an expert on age of consent laws in canada


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] bman#0435
wait i thought i got 24 sessions last week


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
as if all these girls are from canada...?


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
OR THE AGE OF CONSENT??


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
the age of consent in canada is 15 apparently and these girls are not even 15 yet


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] bman#0435
y did i only get 950 😔


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
and he's 18


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I’m in Canada and I’ve never heard that crap


[26-Mar-20 02:03 AM] stacey#1000
Age of consent is not 15


[26-Mar-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
You have to be at least 16 before you can do anything really


[26-Mar-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
You can move out legally at 16 if you wanted to


[26-Mar-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
If it is 15


[26-Mar-20 02:04 AM] stacey#1000
Then they don’t act like it


[26-Mar-20 02:06 AM] emma;#1525
soooo i have a Pastriez HR(?) dming me wanting to report an LR for trolling at their bakery


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] emma;#1525
are we obligated/allowed to do anything if we aren't allied with them


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn this is prob a you question


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] stacey#1000
I mean they shouldn’t be trolling at any group really


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] bman#0435
no


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] bman#0435

[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] stacey#1000
I thought that was a thing


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] bman#0435
stacey we trolled at stapleton


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] emma;#1525
no but we can't technically fire them if it's not bloxton related


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] bman#0435
stapleton is a different group


[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] bman#0435

[26-Mar-20 02:07 AM] bman#0435

But yeah ask minn first


[26-Mar-20 02:08 AM] emma;#1525
i gave her a diplomatic answer


[26-Mar-20 02:08 AM] emma;#1525
Typically our LRs are only help accountable at our games or the games of our affiliates. However, we do operate case by case so I'd be happy to look at the proof and determine if it's appropriate for action to be taken.


[26-Mar-20 02:09 AM] emma;#1525
is what i said


[26-Mar-20 02:09 AM] emma;#1525

[26-Mar-20 02:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; nothing we can do


[26-Mar-20 02:35 AM] xM_inn#2821
it just means that the LR could have his promotion chances decreased if considered for a promotion


[26-Mar-20 02:35 AM] emma;#1525
im hoping she doesnt bring it up again


[26-Mar-20 02:35 AM] emma;#1525
lol


[26-Mar-20 02:35 AM] xM_inn#2821

[26-Mar-20 02:35 AM] emma;#1525

SB hosting a coronavirus themed thing isn't great, but it was with good intentions. What I can't stand is how they handled people being (understandably) upset about it by WARNING AND BANNING them


[26-Mar-20 04:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Loads of seniors are getting active which is good


[26-Mar-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000

[26-Mar-20 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
tbh june hasnt even been that active


[26-Mar-20 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
so I kinda second guess her for senior now but thats just me


[26-Mar-20 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
cause personally myself, I havent seen her a lot


[26-Mar-20 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
for like the past month almost


[26-Mar-20 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
but you guys couldve seen her more then me


[26-Mar-20 05:06 PM] a. ღ#4222

[26-Mar-20 05:20 PM] emma;#1525
june's session activity isn't even good lol


[26-Mar-20 05:20 PM] bman#0435
goes to show our senior candiddates


[26-Mar-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525
there are plenty of other active managers


[26-Mar-20 05:21 PM] emma;#1525
y'all are obsessed with june tho so who else was even considered


[26-Mar-20 05:22 PM] bman#0435
she just sticks out lol


[26-Mar-20 05:22 PM] bman#0435
i mean you voted for her too...


[26-Mar-20 05:30 PM] bman#0435
@a. ღ why cant i join ur server 😭


[26-Mar-20 05:30 PM] a. ღ#4222
idk


[26-Mar-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
I voted June because I knew a vote for someone else wouldnt win because everyone else wanted June


[26-Mar-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
but if im being honest June is not even that active compared to other managers


[26-Mar-20 05:35 PM] bman#0435
thats not a reason to vote june


[26-Mar-20 05:36 PM] bman#0435
i voted her since she appears to know what shes doing and is fairly more active compared to other managers


[26-Mar-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
i also voted because shes been a manager a long time


[26-Mar-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
just need to wait for her to come online now


[26-Mar-20 05:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
i voted her4 cause shes been here forever and her activity is consistent


[26-Mar-20 05:39 PM] a. ღ#4222
she doesnt go afk for like 5 months like kiki!!


[26-Mar-20 06:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@a. ღ ok boomer


[26-Mar-20 06:20 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez ava and the people in vc keep asking if we get paid


[26-Mar-20 06:20 PM] bman#0435

[26-Mar-20 06:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we can say we get paid, just not amount i thought we said that before

@a. ღ Kiki has one long period of inactivity, it’s not like she leave and comes back all the time


[26-Mar-20 06:24 PM] emma;#1525
She’s been super active since January so


[26-Mar-20 06:38 PM] ethan;#0003
@High Rank if you see people with the "vr exploit" it is NOT an exploit, they are using a VR headset. DO NOT BAN THEM FOR EXPLOITING THEY ARE INNOCENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


[26-Mar-20 06:48 PM] a. ღ#4222
@emma; she would’ve been my second choice but I didn’t due to the inactivity lol


[26-Mar-20 06:51 PM] Cooqkie#2809

@High Rank Who suspended bureao/dyewash? There's no suspension card up on the board yet he is suspended and claims his suspension is over. I don't even know what rank to re-rank him to.

[27-Mar-20 12:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I did, he was trash talking Ethan. He was a rank 5.


[27-Mar-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'll handle it.


[27-Mar-20 12:49 AM] bman#0435
ight


[27-Mar-20 12:49 AM] bman#0435

[27-Mar-20 12:50 AM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[27-Mar-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
M'kay, he's ranked back.


[27-Mar-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Only thing is, this will definitely hold back his chances.


[27-Mar-20 12:51 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
If he basically trash talks the high ranks behind our back, it's going to be a long and sluggish road to MR again for him.


[27-Mar-20 12:51 AM] bman#0435
bruh thats not my concern


[27-Mar-20 12:51 AM] bman#0435

@High Rank Someone sent me a report against Cam basically saying he can get his friend promoted faster. The Discord account that reported it is fairly new and I am not sure of the reporter's username, but it's something to still look at. :/

Turn ANY Island into a Tarantula Island & Flower Crossbreeding in A...
It's Day 7 on Plays Island in Animal Crossing New Horizons and we found a way to spawn a LOT of Tarantulas on Island Tours! Also, flower crossbreeding, but I doubt you're watching for that.

[27-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525

We can’t assume that it’s edited any more then we can’t assume it’s not


[27-Mar-20 02:07 PM] emma;#1525
Because that’s how we have a biased investigation


[27-Mar-20 02:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so should we question cam or


[27-Mar-20 02:07 PM] a. ღ#4222

[27-Mar-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t really believe this is a legit report either


[27-Mar-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525
But you can’t just assume

[27-Mar-20 02:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
What about that girl behind cam who said hey, I wonder if we could ask her if she saw Cam say that


[27-Mar-20 02:11 PM] emma;#1525
How does cinder know when people are about to get shift


[27-Mar-20 02:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Although I can’t really see her username


[27-Mar-20 02:11 PM] a. ღ#4222

[27-Mar-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
For the second one


[27-Mar-20 02:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Bman, we didn't even figure out who it is.


[27-Mar-20 02:17 PM] emma;#1525
Trey he’s being sarcastic


[27-Mar-20 02:17 PM] a. ღ#4222
@emma; idk if this helps at all but earlier cam told me that cinder was trying to get him fired , (probably told me like a week ago)


[27-Mar-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah I dealt with that situation


[27-Mar-20 02:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
hm maybe


[27-Mar-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
This is why it’s important we know the roblox name of “Lizzie”


[27-Mar-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525
Sammi


[27-Mar-20 02:18 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Mar-20 02:24 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
yeah bc everyone changes the topic


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
I thought it was fake cause I just woke up and saw y’all saying it was fake so I thought it was


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
I mean I still think it is


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
But


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] a. ღ#4222
investigating won’t hurt


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I was just kinda shocked how it was assumed fake and pushed away. like there’s a high chance it is but it’s always nice to say “oh yeah we investigated that” instead of “oh no we assumed it was fake”


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525
Minn literally got the report and didn’t tell us


[27-Mar-20 02:25 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Mar-20 02:26 PM] bman#0435
@Bloo_Berriez kinda pissed me off because it was like since everyone likes cam so much they pushed it away and didnt wanna do anything abt it which isnt professional


[27-Mar-20 02:26 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[27-Mar-20 02:27 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
well yeah but that doesnt mean they were pushing it away


[27-Mar-20 02:27 PM] bman#0435
i mean yall did kind of push it away and assume it was fake


[27-Mar-20 02:27 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Mar-20 02:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
There’s no point in fighting about what we did and didn’t think can we just all move on and try to solve the investigation rather than pointing fingers of who didn’t wanna investigate 🙄

[27-Mar-20 02:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I have made a severe lapse of my judgement, especially when I told Cinder has actions were scummy for laughing in VC abusing in someone's account. 😔


[27-Mar-20 02:55 PM] a. ღ#4222
cinder only hates trey

[27-Mar-20 02:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[27-Mar-20 02:57 PM] a. ღ#4222

[27-Mar-20 03:51 PM] emma;#1525
So


[27-Mar-20 03:51 PM] emma;#1525
Neither cinder nor meow took the gifs


[27-Mar-20 03:51 PM] emma;#1525
Cinders having a hard time telling me who did


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
Bc he “needs permission” from meow


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
Who is taking a long time to repond


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
Respond


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
LOL


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] emma;#1525
Even though she’s responded instantly to him up until now


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
uhm


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
I’m getting lost in their lies


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
"permission"


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
same


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
so


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
First that person is meow


[27-Mar-20 03:52 PM] a. ღ#4222
Now it’s not ?


[27-Mar-20 03:53 PM] emma;#1525
Yup


[27-Mar-20 03:53 PM] a. ღ#4222
can we just question cam and get his point of view


[27-Mar-20 03:53 PM] a. ღ#4222
I think that would help


[27-Mar-20 03:53 PM] a. ღ#4222
instead of taking someone’s side who just lied to our face twice


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"permission"


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why does he need it


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
finally getting on my laptop


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
its gotten to that point


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
things we know


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he went from that o6ign to meow mad quick


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
1) cinder and meow tried to get cam fired literally 3 days ago


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
😭


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] emma;#1525
2) cinder's already lied


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
they did?


[27-Mar-20 03:54 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yep


[27-Mar-20 03:55 PM] emma;#1525
3) meow is a bitch we cant trust her and we cant trust cinder much further than we can throw him


[27-Mar-20 03:55 PM] bman#0435
wait how


[27-Mar-20 03:55 PM] bman#0435
i dont remember that LOL


[27-Mar-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[27-Mar-20 03:56 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
we done been knew


[27-Mar-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"can i use permission"


[27-Mar-20 03:56 PM] a. ღ#4222
@emma; can we question cam


[27-Mar-20 03:56 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why does he need permission for something he reported in 💀


[27-Mar-20 03:56 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think it would be useful


[27-Mar-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i just asked him if he knew o6ign


[27-Mar-20 03:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he said no


[27-Mar-20 03:57 PM] a. ღ#4222
ya but that was a lie so


[27-Mar-20 03:57 PM] a. ღ#4222

[27-Mar-20 03:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[27-Mar-20 04:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
If it was today it should be his only shift unless he’s done multiple


[27-Mar-20 04:02 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Mar-20 04:02 PM] a. ღ#4222

[27-Mar-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Okay so my opinions on this cam case. Cinder and Meow can't tell me who took the gifs, and they're swearing up and down it's some girl Cam knows. Cam is denying the gifs, but he can't provide much proof it's not true other than he knows the girl who sent the video was apparently reset a bunch for exploiting (but not kicked...?) He also didn't fill out an exploiter report for the girl.


[27-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
Basically no one's side makes much logical sense at all.


[27-Mar-20 04:57 PM] bman#0435
what abt wolfy


[27-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
Wolf was working bar and says she doesn't remember what Cam was doing


[27-Mar-20 04:57 PM] bman#0435
bri?


[27-Mar-20 04:57 PM] emma;#1525
Didn't contact Bri yet


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] emma;#1525
Cam also doens't remember her being on


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
its just strange too how cinder lied


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] a. ღ#4222
and said it was meow


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
she was probs on later


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
tbh i think meow didnt say it was her because she thought it would be a waste of my time


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
but i dont wanna assume that


[27-Mar-20 04:58 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[27-Mar-20 04:59 PM] emma;#1525
Oh she knows that we don't trust her lol


[27-Mar-20 04:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
they lied twice about who it was


[27-Mar-20 04:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
but how is cam supposed to prove he is innocent


[27-Mar-20 04:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
its not like he recorded his shift


[27-Mar-20 04:59 PM] a. ღ#4222
im just so confused -__-


[27-Mar-20 05:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Something always seems to happen during shift vote


[27-Mar-20 05:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ikr what great timing


[27-Mar-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435
fr


[27-Mar-20 05:02 PM] bman#0435
i just know it happened with mia


[27-Mar-20 05:03 PM] emma;#1525
wasn't mad about that though LOL


[27-Mar-20 05:04 PM] emma;#1525
i think this might just have to be a case that ends in us choosing to believe in Cam's character over Cinder and Meow's (as we were most likely going to do from the start)


[27-Mar-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
when this is all done I'm gonna have to pull a ryan 💀


[27-Mar-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
he legit made me investigate him over a discord server that he was "exploiting" and i got so mad at him and afterwards he was liek "oh it was just a test, baby wants us to test seniors before they get promoted to HR"


[27-Mar-20 05:11 PM] emma;#1525
then i didnt even get promoted so i was more mad lmao


[27-Mar-20 05:12 PM] ethan;#0003
if you think about it, the proof that says about promoting mr thing is someone that someone would 100% photshop to make someone say it


[27-Mar-20 05:12 PM] ethan;#0003
someone wouldnt use that wording out of nowhere


[27-Mar-20 05:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mia for shift!


[27-Mar-20 05:12 PM] ethan;#0003
the way it is worded doesnt seem real


[27-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
ok im in contact with the person who sent the videos to meow


[27-Mar-20 05:20 PM] a. ღ#4222
Hopefully it’s not another lie


[27-Mar-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
they're claiming cam is yelling at them over VC for reporting him


[27-Mar-20 05:23 PM] emma;#1525
even tho i didnt know the person's name until 2 seconds ago


[27-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
so how could cam know who reported him


[27-Mar-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
where's the proof of that lmao @emma;


[27-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
but i had cam join a vc with me, and im gonna see if this girl is still saying he's vcing her


[27-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
since you cant VC two calls at once lol


[27-Mar-20 05:24 PM] emma;#1525
but ofc she's not responding


[27-Mar-20 05:24 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[27-Mar-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525

[27-Mar-20 05:34 PM] emma;#1525
as if i give any fucks that he thinks we're a bad HR team lmao


[27-Mar-20 05:35 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[27-Mar-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
I was trying to info someone who isn't in any servers


[27-Mar-20 05:47 PM] emma;#1525
and found a website but you need the ID


[27-Mar-20 05:47 PM] Beartikal#9760
or if your a programmer you can use the Players service to convert a username to a UserId ;^)


[27-Mar-20 05:48 PM] bman#0435
u should help us?!!!!!!

[27-Mar-20 05:49 PM] emma;#1525
fun fact


[27-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
fun fact: you can actually find a player's discord from just their username


[27-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
(uses the Verify bot servers to find it)


[27-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
they locked it recently though


[27-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
now you have to


[27-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
request a key to use it


[27-Mar-20 05:50 PM] Beartikal#9760
which is understandable


[27-Mar-20 05:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

@High Rank Okay FINAL UPDATE on cam situation (unless something big happens) as we all predicted at the start I'm like 99.9% sure this is totally fake lol cinder and meow lied to me during this investigation and the girl who submitted the reports is crazy and also has stopped DMing me. I VCed with cam and he sounded genuinely upset and nervous about the situation  so yeah basically that combined with meow and cinder trying to get cam fired three days ago for a dumb reason leads me to conclude this, of course, is **-slams gavel down on table-** BULLSHIT! If for some reason you disagree please state below.

June_Riley1 | December 28 - ?? | I just need a break from Bloxton. I have just became more tired sitting all day and staring at my screen. Also, my personal issues have been getting worse, so I just need a break. I have also been spending very little time with my family lately and I feel bad about that. I will probably be online on on weekends depending if I’m busy or not. I will be on discord though week days and weekends.

[27-Mar-20 11:20 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah the hacker abused... then he got access back...


[27-Mar-20 11:20 PM] bman#0435
HE WAS DEMOTED


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
AND RAMM RANKED IT BACKED


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
AND HE JUST CUFF ABUSED AGAIN


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] ethan;#0003
.


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] ethan;#0003
YOU NEVER SAID THAT


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
i literally did


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
u were being illiterate


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] bman#0435
not my issue


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] ethan;#0003
...


[27-Mar-20 11:21 PM] ethan;#0003
show me where you said that


[27-Mar-20 11:24 PM] emma;#1525
@bman you never said he cuff abused


[27-Mar-20 11:25 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; ok so maybe i didnt just say it but it was said in here before


[27-Mar-20 11:25 PM] bman#0435
@emma; did u even look at the card attachments


[27-Mar-20 11:25 PM] bman#0435
and yes, i did


[27-Mar-20 11:25 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[27-Mar-20 11:45 PM] emma;#1525
Okay but you still can't fire someone with evidence from 2017 and none from now lol


[27-Mar-20 11:45 PM] emma;#1525
People who are fired are allowed to get jobs again


[27-Mar-20 11:45 PM] emma;#1525
If we haven't blacklisted them that's our fault


[27-Mar-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
But if he cuff abused today then he cuff abused today and it's not an issue I guess


[27-Mar-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
wait


[27-Mar-20 11:46 PM] emma;#1525
@bman DId he even cuff abuse today


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
no


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
i never said he did


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
but he claimed he was hacked


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
and then told me and ramm he had access again


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
and to rank him


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
and as soon as ramm ranked


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
he cuff abused


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] bman#0435
and he was rank 1 when ramm ranked back


[27-Mar-20 11:47 PM] emma;#1525
Recently?


[27-Mar-20 11:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I thought he did something new


[27-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming You fired him for cuff abuse a few days ago


[27-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
But didn't blacklist him


[27-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
So we can't just... fire him...


[27-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
For no reason...


[27-Mar-20 11:49 PM] emma;#1525
If he isn't blacklisted...


[27-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
His alt wasn't technically breaking any rules


[27-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
Or am I missing something here


[27-Mar-20 11:50 PM] emma;#1525
@bman


[27-Mar-20 11:52 PM] bman#0435
ur confusing me now tbh


[27-Mar-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
@bman If he wasn't blacklisted when you fired him, and you didn't fire him for doing anything... I'm not sure that's legit lol


[27-Mar-20 11:52 PM] emma;#1525
I'd ask minn personally


[27-Mar-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
Idrc if he's blacklisted or not bc he's annoying but I want to make sure we aren't being biased bc we don't like him


[27-Mar-20 11:53 PM] bman#0435
im not being biased at all, and yes it was recently


[27-Mar-20 11:53 PM] bman#0435
he most liekly lied to ramm and i to avoid being ususpended


[27-Mar-20 11:53 PM] emma;#1525
lied about what


[27-Mar-20 11:54 PM] bman#0435
he was "hacked" and ranked to rank 1 and the "abuser" cuff abused, then ramm ranked him back to rank 6 after he claimed he had his account back, and he went back tot cuff abusing


[28-Mar-20 12:16 AM] ethan;#0003
@bman why did you blacklist him?


[28-Mar-20 12:16 AM] ethan;#0003
4 out of 5 of the firings happened in 2017...


[28-Mar-20 12:17 AM] ethan;#0003
and 2 or 3 of them where because he was an HR in other bloxton groups


[28-Mar-20 12:18 AM] bman#0435
if u wanna rehire him then go ahead


[28-Mar-20 12:19 AM] ethan;#0003
I want to tell him to appeal his bans so he isnt considered a "CB"


[28-Mar-20 12:19 AM] bman#0435
i tolf him he can appeal


[28-Mar-20 12:20 AM] bman#0435
but hes just being annoying af at this point lmfao


[28-Mar-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
@bman Okay look at it this way


[28-Mar-20 12:24 AM] emma;#1525
If he wasn't fired 4 previous times, not counting the one a few days ago, what would you do


[28-Mar-20 12:25 AM] bman#0435
probably the same thing, regardless if i knew it was 2r or not since it happened 3+ times


[28-Mar-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
So you dont want his blacklist removed?


[28-Mar-20 12:26 AM] ethan;#0003
Even though 4 of 5 of his firings are from 2017?


[28-Mar-20 12:26 AM] bman#0435
i literally said i dont care at this point, if u want to rerank him then go ahead


[28-Mar-20 12:27 AM] ethan;#0003
I am going to unblacklist him but not re-rank him


[28-Mar-20 12:27 AM] ethan;#0003
Ill tell him he can re-apply


[28-Mar-20 12:32 AM] ethan;#0003
I unblacklisted him.


[28-Mar-20 12:32 AM] ethan;#0003
Told him he will not be reinstated of his position.


[28-Mar-20 12:32 AM] ethan;#0003
And that he will need to re-apply


[28-Mar-20 01:03 AM] stacey#1000
OMG YES CAM IS GETTING PROMOTED SOON HYPE


[28-Mar-20 01:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
@bman What did you fire him for originally? Despite his 2017 record.


[28-Mar-20 01:52 AM] bman#0435
claimed he was hacked to get out of a suspension and was rank 1, ramm ranked him back when he had access, and he immediately went back to cuff abusing


[28-Mar-20 01:52 AM] bman#0435
on his alt


[28-Mar-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
So he cuff abused on an ALT (ryan) while being security at bloxton?


[28-Mar-20 01:53 AM] bman#0435
yup


[28-Mar-20 01:53 AM] bman#0435
and lied about being hacked to avoid punishments


[28-Mar-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alright and then he was blacklisted for the incident and his 2017 record?

[28-Mar-20 01:53 AM] bman#0435
i mean technically, since he has had 5 suspensions/terminations in total


[28-Mar-20 01:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alright well in future lets not use records from 2017 to blacklist someone


[28-Mar-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
Also make sure you're asking HRs for advice if you're unsure


[28-Mar-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
And finally drop the attitude with Ethan, there was no need to be rude when Ethan is trying to help resolve the incident


[28-Mar-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
i dont think i was being rude to ethan but sorry if i was

[28-Mar-20 08:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
I suspended him for immaturity


[28-Mar-20 08:10 AM] Polk#1596
bonnie you are clearly in the wrong because you use favoritism!


[28-Mar-20 08:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
As there was a management vote for it


[28-Mar-20 08:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
And then straw fired him for something else


[28-Mar-20 08:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
And banned him


[28-Mar-20 08:10 AM] Polk#1596

OH


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
noob


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i thought he admitted he leaked @emma;


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
he said he didnt know it was leaking


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then went on that protest bullshit lol


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] bman#0435
even tho i said it was in rules


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oh yeah then he


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
went on a protest


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
so we decided not to hire him back ig?


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
he's p_xul 2.0 lmaoo


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey how is admitting to leaking worse than being caught


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
@¢. ღ no he was fired for a false reason


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
He could have come back


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
oh


[28-Mar-20 02:00 PM] emma;#1525
But I discovered he leaked that photo


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
can we not fire her for leaking that photo


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
because its so minor


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Now maybe we normally wouldn’t be so strict if he hadn’t gone on a rampage but he was falsely fired so


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
then he started a fight w/ you for no good reason lol


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Ya know


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
admitting to leaking gets u less harsher consequences depending on what and how much was leaked


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Did paizley admit to it


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk Accept my friend request on discord.


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] emma;#1525
Has anyone even talked to her


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
no she didnt


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] bman#0435
unless ur kayla and pyscho and yell at everyone to admit it or else u demote people


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i just got on again lol


[28-Mar-20 02:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
maybe i could


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
the lr who posted it in general said that paizley sent him it


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
Idk if she needs to be fired but I feel like at least a short suspension,.. I mean she clearly told toxilla who sent that and it could have ended up in rainbow getting targeted


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
^


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
mhm


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
And it’s common knowledge that you can’t send anything from staff lounge


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] bman#0435
thats happened to me but with the cb list and all the cbs targeting me xDDDDDDDDD


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also off topic but


[28-Mar-20 02:02 PM] emma;#1525
But someone needs to talk to her first


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
has anyone seen the screenshots for kenzi's behavior


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
Again idk what it is with this “let’s not talk to someone about a report against them” bs


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
and i was at camp and yall didnt even know people leaked the doc xDDDDDDD


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
Trey one thing at a time pls


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
My brain can’t handle two at once


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
Can someone talk to paizley rq


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
fair enough


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
And ask about it


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i will


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
Then we can decide on a suspension length


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
Prob 2-3 days


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
3 is the minimum emma


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
depends on her intentions


[28-Mar-20 02:03 PM] emma;#1525
And while we’re at it are we suspending whoever leaked the cb list


[28-Mar-20 02:04 PM] bman#0435
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[28-Mar-20 02:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's faraxaz


[28-Mar-20 02:04 PM] Polk#1596
..scary @stacey


[28-Mar-20 02:04 PM] bman#0435
farraxz


[28-Mar-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525
Bc that’s legit the same thing here


[28-Mar-20 02:04 PM] emma;#1525

ok so


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't think there's really bad intentions here


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh yeah and uh


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
We might have to re-announce the “no leaking” thing


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
still leaked lol


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i agree emma


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
we did like 10 times


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
Bc clearly people are forgetting


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
how many more times do they need it announced


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
Well we have a lot of newer heads


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
And they’re the ones leaking


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
So clearly we need another update


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
It’s not that big of a deal


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
ya


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
and leaking shouldve been discussed in their rules


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
who wants to announce


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] emma;#1525
Does anyone else want to do it bc the staff announcements is too flooded with me rn lol


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
reminding them not to leak the cb list or leak images without the owner's consent n stuff


[28-Mar-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
i will


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435

[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok cool


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
i discussed it with paizley but clearly she didnt listen


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] bman#0435
WAIT WHAT IF WE SAVE IT AS CAMS FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT?!??!??!?!??!!??!!


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i got some responses from her btw @bman


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey specifically mention the difference between a picture that’s ORIGINALLY posted in SL and one that people got from somewhere else and reposted in SL


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
and how only the first is leaking


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] emma;#1525
Technically


[28-Mar-20 02:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh yeah of course


[28-Mar-20 02:07 PM] emma;#1525
I don’t want to make cam announce something relatively negative on his first day


[28-Mar-20 02:07 PM] emma;#1525
There’s plenty of things he’ll be able to announce later lol


[28-Mar-20 02:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what else should i add specifically @emma;


[28-Mar-20 02:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666

[28-Mar-20 02:07 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
unfriended


[28-Mar-20 02:08 PM] emma;#1525
Basically don’t send anything, regardless of if it’s Bloxton related or not, from any of the staff channels


[28-Mar-20 02:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
***Bliss somtimes I feel u don't like me or don't enjoy talking to me like I know ur busy but i feel like u don't put a lot of effort in our friendship and it makes me upset***


[28-Mar-20 02:08 PM] emma;#1525
If there’s something you think would be useful (like sending a cb list) you need permission from an HR first


[28-Mar-20 02:08 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
TREY SHUT THE FUCK UP OMG


[28-Mar-20 02:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Mar-20 02:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Mar-20 02:10 PM] a. ღ#4222

@High Rank ik u all want to watch the promotion but the only way to watch the promotion is to be at stage 1 of shift promoter training (the first shift promotion after you get promoted to gm)

you then can promote someone to shift!!!!! wooo but you never want new shifts these days nor is anyone resigning so thats gonna happen in 2022


[28-Mar-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435

@Cam **DECLINE OF FRIENDSHIP**

Hello, Cam!

As sad as it may seem, but I am announcing that our friendship has officially come to a close as of 7:02 PM. I don't think that us both make a good pair nor do we get along with each other. As a result, your office has been officially removed as well from the office. I am discontinuing this friendship not because I hate you, but due to the fact that we do not get along and that is the main purpose. Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

Dear Farraxz.

You have been placed under suspension for 3 days due to leaking the CB document. While this leaking of the document may have been an accident, our leaking policies strictly prohibit any links, images, or text sent within that channel to be exposed to others who do not have access. If you have any further questions about your suspension, please do not hesitate to ask me or another HR. Thank you and have a great day.

Like he's mainly a developer on multiple groups


[28-Mar-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
so if u think thats irrelevant


[28-Mar-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435

oh yeah bman


[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do you care if people can share the cb list with your permission or just keep it to MR+ use only @bman


[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
mr+ use


[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
because LRs do ask for the CB list just track who's who


[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i don't trust them but y'know


[28-Mar-20 07:34 PM] bman#0435
so i dont have to keep making a new freaking doc everytime a cb gets ahold of it


[28-Mar-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey wheres your announcement


[28-Mar-20 07:36 PM] emma;#1525
why does it take 4 hours to draft an announcement not to leak


[28-Mar-20 07:37 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm looking back on messages you told me and trying to word it properly


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
you know how it is


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
then just put whatever you have in here


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
and i'll help you fix it


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] bman#0435
just copy and paste an older announcement


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
that doesnt rly work


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
bc then


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
no thanks lol @bman


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] emma;#1525
but i really dont like how it takes people (not just you, a lot of HRs) like 5 hours to put an announcement up


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809
theyre probably not going to rad it


[28-Mar-20 07:38 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[28-Mar-20 07:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

**LEAKING POLICY UPDATE** 📪 

Greetings, MR Team! Hope you all are having a great Saturday so far. Today, I would to provide to an update for you all on a topic that I'm sure you all have heard many times by now, Leaking. I'll be starting off with the CB list, since many users of the MR Team use it on a daily basis. I would like to remind you all that the document is for MR+ use only, so do not share it to members who are not apart of the MR Team. What could potentially happen if you send it to an LR is that they could possibly be the CBs themselves, or the document could end up spreading around with the CBs harassing the author itself, Bman. Also, I would like to point out the difference on a picture that's originally posted on the staff lounge or a user getting the picture from somewhere else and re-posting it to the staff lounge channel. Now, a picture that's originally posted on the stage lounge channel can be classified as leaking, and you will be met with some consequences depending on the review. On the other hand, re-posting a picture on staff lounge if you posted it somewhere else first is **NOT** leaking. As always, if you have a question regarding this announcement, be sure to to reach out with any member(s) of the HR Team whenever we're available. Thank you for reading, and have a good rest of your night!


Best Regards,

[28-Mar-20 07:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lol when vac did that at my session when he came back i told him that he could leave and he was like "I'll supervise" and i said "I can do that" and he was like "ok" and left @a. ღ


[28-Mar-20 07:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
just figure out the time slot of when you want to slock so you can mod quicker @Cam


[28-Mar-20 07:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's what i would personally do


[28-Mar-20 07:59 PM] bman#0435

[28-Mar-20 07:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Mar-20 08:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[28-Mar-20 08:01 PM] bman#0435

let's see how this takes us


[28-Mar-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
🤔


[28-Mar-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
she apparently deleted the link


[28-Mar-20 08:03 PM] bman#0435
im asking for their full dms


[28-Mar-20 08:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
her mentioning that there's a new one sounds fishy


[28-Mar-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ye go for it @bman


[28-Mar-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
why superfluous tho @emma;


[28-Mar-20 08:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
(you can explain this when ur ready)


[28-Mar-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
oop


[28-Mar-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
she said the rest of their dms are inappropriate


[28-Mar-20 08:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
👀


[28-Mar-20 08:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
is that so


[28-Mar-20 08:07 PM] bman#0435
they snap apparently


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
@xAfroTrey i just feel like you use a lot of long sentences when you could define what leaking is and then list examples of leaking vs not leaking


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] emma;#1525
Bc you’re only really covering the two cases I mentioned but I assumed it was going to be a more general announcement


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
@ethan; literally tell two heads to leave and join story


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
aka drews server


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] bman#0435
@emma; can u tell me about farr suspension letter


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
@Cam


[28-Mar-20 08:09 PM] bman#0435
Dear Farraxz.

You have been placed under suspension for 3 days due to leaking the CB document. While this leaking of the document may have been an accident, our leaking policies strictly prohibit any links, images, or text sent within that channel to be exposed to others who do not have access. If you have any further questions about your suspension, please do not hesitate to ask me or another HR. Thank you and have a great day.

[28-Mar-20 08:11 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm confused


[28-Mar-20 08:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
isn't our focus usually targeted towards on how you share pictures & leaking the cb list


[28-Mar-20 08:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm pretty sure that's what we discussed yesterday


[28-Mar-20 08:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
also


[28-Mar-20 08:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i'm pretty sure mrs are pretty understanding of what leaking is, so i'm a bit puzzled on what you mean on defining it


[28-Mar-20 08:17 PM] bman#0435
clearly they dont


[28-Mar-20 08:19 PM] a. ღ#4222

Dear Farraxz.

You have been placed under suspension for 3 days due to leaking the CB document. While this leaking of the document may have been an accident, our leaking policies strictly prohibit any links, images, or text sent within that channel to be exposed to others who do not have access. If you have any further questions about your suspension, please do not hesitate to ask me or another HR. Thank you and have a great day.

He took 10k+ robux and her super happy face. I found this bitch on trade handout and confronted him and when Maya says “you know what you did” he leaves the server. He’s gonna lose his acc soon

My first report as an HR..


[29-Mar-20 01:05 PM] Cam#5887
User is a Receptionist, and this was directed toward another staff member.


[29-Mar-20 01:06 PM] Cam#5887
Since it's threats, would it be a fire?


[29-Mar-20 01:06 PM] Cam#5887
And being extremely rude.


[29-Mar-20 01:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes, it would be.


[29-Mar-20 01:07 PM] Cam#5887
Okay, so I can fire with this proof?


[29-Mar-20 01:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yep, them threatening Bloxton is basically the cherry on top.


[29-Mar-20 01:08 PM] Cam#5887
Yeah. Okay, so I put that on the HR board under Demotions?


[29-Mar-20 01:09 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

**LEAKING POLICY UPDATE** 📪 

Greetings, MR Team! Hope you all are having a great Saturday so far. Today, I would to provide to an update for you all on a topic that I'm sure you all have heard many times by now, Leaking. I'll be starting off with the CB list, since many users of the MR Team use it on a daily basis. I would like to remind you all that the document is for MR+ use only, so do not share it to members who are not apart of the MR Team. What could potentially happen if you send it to an LR is that they could possibly be the CBs themselves, or the document could end up spreading around with the CBs harassing the author itself, Bman. Also, I would like to point out the difference on a picture that's originally posted on the staff lounge or a user getting the picture from somewhere else and re-posting it to the staff lounge channel. Now, a picture that's originally posted on the stage lounge channel can be classified as leaking, and you will be met with some consequences depending on the review. On the other hand, re-posting a picture on staff lounge if you posted it somewhere else first is **NOT** leaking. As always, if you have a question regarding this announcement, be sure to to reach out with any member(s) of the HR Team whenever we're available. Thank you for reading, and have a good rest of your night!


Best Regards,

*xAfroTrey*

@xAfroTrey so I just don’t like how your announcement is structured at all, but that’s just a personal choice so are you wanting me to like... rewrite it so I like it.... or do you want to just post what you have anyways


[29-Mar-20 01:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
50 k take it or leave it


[29-Mar-20 01:30 PM] xM_inn#2821

@xAfroTrey ok but you didn’t talk at all about how it’s leaking regardless of if it’s a Bloxton related image or not, you can’t leak any text in SL regardless of if it’s Bloxton related or not, you can’t leak any other documents put up in announcements

[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
for either nothign, warning, suspension, or termiantion


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
we need more because that isnt major leaking


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
in here


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
that is minor leaking


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
very minor


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
she would still face a punishment regardless


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] Cam#5887
i can ask for more proof if needed, but they didnt say anything else


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think there would be anything else


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
i would ask for more


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That seems like a suspension atm


[29-Mar-20 08:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
First step is do they have a suspension history


[29-Mar-20 08:54 PM] ethan;#0003

[29-Mar-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[29-Mar-20 08:55 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yea


[29-Mar-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
march 18th it looks like


[29-Mar-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[29-Mar-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
march 18th


[29-Mar-20 08:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They just didn’t know, so just give them a friendly reminder of the rule. It was super minor.


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
ok so a verbal warning? or written?


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
or just like a


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
heads up


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Just let her know that everything is confidential


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
ok


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
and no punishment?


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Since she is new just a strict warning.


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
i mean


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
trey made an announcement...


[29-Mar-20 08:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
My opinion is yes, anyone against that


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bman they are new


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] Cam#5887
im still brand stinking new, so im just putting it here and kinda learning


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
trey still made an announcement and when i go through rules i have a full section about leaking


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] Cam#5887
like from all of you


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
You’re good cam


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming bman doesn't believe in warnings. He just likes to go straight to terminations.


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Naw


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
who promoted her anyways?


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
me


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think she deserves a suspension


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bman do you have where you told her the rules


[29-Mar-20 08:57 PM] bman#0435
thanks ethan for assuming stuff about me lmfao


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] ethan;#0003
its not assuming


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] ethan;#0003
thats like the third time youve jumped to that this week


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
can we not do this ethan


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
If you told her in your rules just message her


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] bman#0435
[LEAKING]

Leaking is big deal when it comes to this group and its chats. We taking leaking VERY seriously. Leaking is a major major offense that will lead to an instant termination of your rank.

Some things that may be considered leaking are:

-Telling your friends/people about the MR channels.
-Taking screenshots of the content in the MR channels and sending it to your friends/people.
-Telling your friends/people through a voice call.

If you end up leaking on accident, delete the stuff right away and message an HR. Consequences will not be as major.

If you don’t leak, you will be happily thriving in your new MR rank.

Any questions about leaking?


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] ethan;#0003
was that in staff announcements?


[29-Mar-20 08:58 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
where's the part about talking about info


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
yeah it was


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
take a look


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It isn’t explicitly stated but she should know anything in SL is confidential


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’ve just been feeling so much lately that our new MR’s have been leaking and I think to myself is it something  we’re not clarifying but yet again I assume everyone here has a good do not leak section in there rules


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So I would just give her a gases warning


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] bman#0435
i understand that ramm, but trey still made an annoncement about it


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
strict*


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Cam#5887
i dont have rules yet..


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Cam#5887
i gotta make em


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yes cam for your first promo!!


[29-Mar-20 08:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well yeah besides you because you’re new lol but everyone else

[29-Mar-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
I mean


[29-Mar-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525
minn specifically stated leaking = termination


[29-Mar-20 09:00 PM] emma;#1525

who are we if we don't follow through


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
"cool kid" @Bloo_Berriez


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
stopppp we don’t have a lot of MRs


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] ethan;#0003
is her name still nni2? or did she change it


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
yes we do


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
This wasn’t enough critical info


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
THATS NN21?


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
that makes sense


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
🙄


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's nni2


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
so


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
who’s that


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
we can't just


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] ethan;#0003
it seems like it was an accident


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
not fire people


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
because we "dont have many MRs"


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
even though we do lol


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i mean like


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it doesn't seem like there's any bad intentions here


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Emma she is new


[29-Mar-20 09:01 PM] emma;#1525
how is it an accident when we specifically state "Leak this and be terminated" every time we announce a termination


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And think if you were in her shoes


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] ethan;#0003
It doesnt seem like she leaked it on purpose. It seems like she was asked a question, and she didnt think it through and just said it


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
It's literally impossible to know why someone was fired and NOT know you will be terminated for leaking that reason


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I feel like a lot of what MR’s are doing is saying this stuff without thinking about it and assume it’s not confidential information so they just blurt it out like the Farr situation


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
because it is announced


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
EVERY


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
TIME


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That would be such a stupid thing to fire someone over


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It’s so small


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
vs bman's document is usually just sent out without a "leak this and be terminated"


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] emma;#1525
so that's why that is a different situation


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
so


[29-Mar-20 09:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what now


[29-Mar-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
If we set the precedent of you get fired for leaking termination reasons, I don't think it's appropriate to say "well she clearly didn't mean to"


[29-Mar-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
when she clearly.... did...


[29-Mar-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
like telling people why someone is terminated isn't beneficial at all


[29-Mar-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
sending out the cb doc at least is in good intentions


[29-Mar-20 09:03 PM] emma;#1525
what nicole did is just plain gossip


[29-Mar-20 09:03 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ok so like


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
who leaked


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
do we just jump straight to a termination once a voting is up?


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] emma;#1525
@Tattoblue nicole


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] Cam#5887
nni2's new useranme is nicoleeqz


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] bman#0435
lets do a poll on warning suspension or termination


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] Cam#5887
username*


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
oh


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well based on what emma said


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] emma;#1525
we're going to vote on something that minn literally set a punishment for-


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] emma;#1525
are you kidding me


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think i'm changing my mind


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we've said not to leak soo many times


[29-Mar-20 09:04 PM] bman#0435
well some people here believe i jump straight to termiantions


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
and we kind of need to vote on everything


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
again it's 100% not possible to know that you can't leak termination reasons because it is announced EVERY TIME


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
dont we?


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
no


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
o i thouht we did


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
i thought 5 votes or bod perms


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
I mean we can vote to terminate her


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
but I don't think we shoudl vote to warn/suspend


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
because that's literally not the precedent set here


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] Cam#5887
is it ok that im just watching?


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
well i guess we can just do it now


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
just watching what


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525

still


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
dw we argue about this stuff alot


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] bman#0435
were just debating on the bestconsequence


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
it's good lol


[29-Mar-20 09:05 PM] emma;#1525
you'll have your chance to get in lol


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] Cam#5887
ok


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] Cam#5887
cool


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
ur only one day in so


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
ok since we're so divided I guess I'll put up a tag


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
with both sides


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
and people can "vote"


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i wouldn't be mad


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
i guess .-.


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] emma;#1525
I don't like it but since we're like half and half


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i think i'm gonna switch to a termination


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
cause ur right emma


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that shit is pretty much straight up gossip


[29-Mar-20 09:06 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
and plus the announcements promised a termination soo


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
might as well follow through


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
i dont see why leaking in general should be taken as lightly as a warning in the first place


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
like leaking is leaking


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
nobody said it woudl


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
would*


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
some people wanted to leave her off with a warning


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
uh no


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
um yes


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
lmao


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
that's not gonna help her lol


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
exactly


[29-Mar-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
ramm and ethan wanted to warn

**Nicole Situation**  @High Rank (PLEASE LEAVE WRITTEN OUT OPINIONS WHEN VOTING THANKS)

If you're like "what nicole situation" then scroll up before reading.

Opinion A - Nicole leaking was most likely a mistake and she probably didn't realize it was against the rules, and since we're low on MRs we shouldn't be firing for such a small instance. We should warn OR suspend her.

Opinion B - Minn clearly stated that leaking termination reasons results in the leaker being fired. This is announced every time we tell the MRs about a termination so it isn't a surprise or something the MRs don't know about. Nicole violated this, so she should be fired.

🅰️ - Suspend her for 3(OR MORE) days  OR 🇧 - Fire her  (We aren't just going to warn her... that's dumb)

thats the second time it got shut down


[29-Mar-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
exploiters


[29-Mar-20 09:10 PM] bman#0435
I believe we should fire nni2 as leaking shouldn't be tolerated in general. As stated within Min's announcement too, the information on why she was terminated should not have been discussed outside of MR territory areas. Therefore, my vote is B.


[29-Mar-20 09:10 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
**cough** cinder

**Letter Of Termination**

Dear nicoleeqz, I regret to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as Head of Services as of 30th March 2020, time SGT, due to leaking termination reasons from the Staff Announcements channel. We take leaking seriously and any form of leaking will result in a termination.

The Bloxton HR Team wishes you all the best in your future endeavours. If you have any questions or concerns, please direct them to any member of the HR Team.

**NOTICE OF TERMINATION**

Dear Bloxton MRs,

As part of our efforts in being transparent, I regret to inform you all that **nicoleeqz** has been terminated from her position as Head of Services due to leaking. We take leaking here seriously and as said above, the information sent in Staff Announcements is for MR browsing only. Any form of leaking will result in a termination.

If you have any questions or concerns, please direct them to me as I will be opening my DMs for a short while. Take note that leaking this announcement to any non-MR will also result in a termination from your position.

Yours sincerely,
Mackpacker

[29-Mar-20 09:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
WHY ARE WE FIRING


[29-Mar-20 09:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That’s too much guys holy balls


[29-Mar-20 09:58 PM] ethan;#0003
ikr


[29-Mar-20 09:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@PackItUpMack who said to fire


[29-Mar-20 09:58 PM] bman#0435
the 7 people that voted


[29-Mar-20 09:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Where is vote


[29-Mar-20 09:59 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
See the ping


[29-Mar-20 09:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Holy fuck


[29-Mar-20 09:59 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
You’re gonna fire her over that


[29-Mar-20 10:00 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Tell that to the 6 others


[29-Mar-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack I'd specifically include it was for leaking termination reasons


[29-Mar-20 10:02 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Well sorry but that’s unnecessary for someone who was just promoted


[29-Mar-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
instead of just classified information


[29-Mar-20 10:02 PM] emma;#1525
bc shes gonna probably have no idea what you're on about


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming I'm sorry but it's unnecessary for an MR, no matter how new, to be leaking information that literally has "If you leak this you will be fired" in the same paragraph


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] emma;#1525
Either she can't read or she doesn't care


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I bet she will be like


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
DONT FIRE


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Oh i didnt know-


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
DONT FIRE


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
GUYS


[29-Mar-20 10:03 PM] babymariobebe#7563
dont fire them


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] babymariobebe#7563
This has gotta be the dumbest reason for firing someone that I've ever seen


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe I mean this with all due respect.... But... no... it's really not


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
We're firing someone for something that Minn said "You will be fired if you do this"


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
about


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
She’s a new MR


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
How is that dumb lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
She can READ ramm


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
and if she can't then we don't want her anyways


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
but you get a lot thrown at you as a new MR


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@everyone They will remain their rank with no action necessary, there is nothing wrong with knowing why another staff member was fired??


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
A reading test isn't one of htem


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe We literally made that a rule months ago


[29-Mar-20 10:04 PM] babymariobebe#7563
And if they just got promoted? what even


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Well it shouldnt be one


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
This is not another staff member this is mr+


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
You can't just pull executive privilege and override a rule we ALL agreed on


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] babymariobebe#7563
its so pointless


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] ethan;#0003
WOOO GO BABY!!!


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
Talk to Minn he's the one who put it IN HIS PARAGRAPH that she leaked


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
We already voted about this


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] stacey#1000
maybe stop announce firings again...?


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
Feel free to vote to suspend her instead


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
But we'll go with what the vote results in


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] stacey#1000
i mean again idk her


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] emma;#1525
As we always do


[29-Mar-20 10:05 PM] stacey#1000
so


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] ethan;#0003
finaly someone understans that leaking useless info isnt the end of the world


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I did that my first week and got suspended. I was devastated but I had so much given to me rule wise not everything stuck. Especially if they have no past history. If they do it again after being warned of course I’ll agree with a suspension but hoping right to it will destroy us


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
No just leave them their role, why is any action necessary


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
Ramm we did a VOTE for a REASON


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Wtf


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
where I litearlly put your side up on there


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] a. ღ#4222
uh


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
and people STILL VOTED TO FIRE HER


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So do or dont do


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Get minn here


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] babymariobebe#7563
dont do


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
We'll wait for what Minn has to say I guess


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
but Bloo approved it


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
and he's a BOD


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
so


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We are a fun group not a strict one


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] ethan;#0003
i only voted yes because i couldnt vote no


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
technically we have the approval we need


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
yes you could ethan


[29-Mar-20 10:06 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] ethan;#0003
it was two options yes or suspension


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah bc we aren't just going to warn someone for breaking a big rule that was IN HER FACE


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Sighs


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
at the LEAST she's getting a 3 day suspension


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Half of the complains I receive from people saying why they prefer to work at other groups is because they say ours is really strict on interviews and what not, and I honestly believe it to be true


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Idk anymor


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe to be fair the interview questions are yours


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] a. ღ#4222
uh then make a new leaking rule cause weve had a "u cant even leak picture" thing for a while and none of u had said anything so not our fault


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
they haven't changed in 4 years


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
the 3 sentence requirements and all that are from you baby lol


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] emma;#1525
that's what kills people


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
we need to not be as strict. We want people@having fun. That’s such a small thing to lose everything over


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont think we are that strict


[29-Mar-20 10:07 PM] bman#0435
were not even strict on interviews


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I forgo all the commas


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
No its probably some time limit put in place


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] babymariobebe#7563
3 sentences isnt that hard, short sentences are allowed


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003
Ik why


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
Yes we give them like 2-3 minutes to answer questions that should take them 20 seconds to answer


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003
most hrs dont hire people under a certaiin age


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Short sentences are shit


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003
they "investigate" them


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They are under 13


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003
if they are like 20 days old


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
Because if they take 5 minutes for 2 sentences at the IC they won't be able to give out rooms on time at the hotel


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
that's not strict that's having a functioning staff team


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
Strict is doing 2 grammar tests


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] ethan;#0003
i hire anyone at my interviews if they dont act sketchy


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
or giving them 30 seconds


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
to answer


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Not everyone is in even middle school


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont even give them time limit


[29-Mar-20 10:08 PM] emma;#1525
literally our interviews can be passed by 8 year olds


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I just let them type whatever


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
and i know that bc ive litearlly dealt with 8 year olds


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] bman#0435
how did this topic change to interviews lol


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
if they cant answer 3 sentences in 3 minutes then thats kinda sad


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
im not strict at interviews lol


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
bc baby is complaining that we're "strict" even tho we've changed a lot of rules to be less strict


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
I do the easiest grammar test


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
my grammar test isn't even gramatically correct for the answer


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] emma;#1525
bc im easy on it


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye i dont even consider commas


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
"Hello, can I get a room please?"


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] stacey#1000
easiest thing ever


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] a. ღ#4222
we give them enough time


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Ok just back to the topic at hand we shouldnt be firing ppl for knowing why someone else was fired, like whats wrong with that??


[29-Mar-20 10:09 PM] ethan;#0003
people say we are strict at interviews because of how much we investigate low account ages.... it has nothing to do with answering the actual questions


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe One of the ONLY rules we have about staff lounge and staff announcements is you cannot leak *anything* without an HR's consent


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Listen if they leak again you can fire my ass too but if you fire them I don’t know what to say


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] bman#0435
well it was said only in mr channels and min specifically said not to leak it


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
They know but they went to tell other ppl


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] ethan;#0003
@babymariobebe you need to see what we have voted on people getting fired for in the past it is the stupiedest things


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] a. ღ#4222
we announced it to mrs literally not the entire bloxton


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] stacey#1000
CBs still manage to get staff accounts so I mean they will just get fired if they abuse/troll...?


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@ethan; I believe it


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] stacey#1000
The account age thing annoys me


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] emma;#1525
If LRs know why formers were fired they can LEGIT HARASS THEM


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] emma;#1525
that's why we don't publicize it


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey if they abuse/troll we fire them end of story


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
If they discuss it themselves its fine but she told an lr


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] emma;#1525
TO everyone


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
The lr can go tell everyone


[29-Mar-20 10:10 PM] emma;#1525
LRs aren't bound by no-leaking rules


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] emma;#1525
So if they find out why someone was fired what's to stop them from spreading it around and getting non-staff members to harass someone because they were fired


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] emma;#1525
I don't want our group to have the reputation of "you get harassed if you are fired"


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] emma;#1525
If that's what you want then fine lmao but not me


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
I mean they can still get that by us announcing it to the MRs alone


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563
nobody would harass them like come on thats just overreacting


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] a. ღ#4222
..


[29-Mar-20 10:11 PM] emma;#1525
It's happened before


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] a. ღ#4222
uhm yes they do..


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] emma;#1525
It'll happen again


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But it’s not like it was someone who was repeatedly told not to leak they were JUST PROMOTED TWO WEEKS AGO. It’s not like they have been an MR for 3 months.


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
i got harassed from someone leaking a doc that was only in staff announcements


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] bman#0435
lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe we just stop announcing it to MRs altogether


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] emma;#1525
Baby no offense but you aren't super involved in the administrative stuff we do, so you really don't know what a lot of these things lead to


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; the things that people get fired for are for leaking the most MININMAL THINGS that will NOT effect the group WHATSO EVER  if lrs find out about the info leaked


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] emma;#1525
Harassment is the LEAST of our worries


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] emma;#1525
usually


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] emma;#1525
It happens all the time lol


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] babymariobebe#7563
if anything being fired for 'leaking' a minor detail would be more embarrassing and 'harass-worthy'


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] emma;#1525
Not really...?


[29-Mar-20 10:12 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
baby that's not their business lol


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
Being fired because you ignored the 1st major rule of being an MR, even when it was said to you at your promo and WRITTEN in the thing you leaked, is called a just termination for being stupid


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
And the fact that you don't think that shows a lot tbh because leaking small things leads to leaking bigger things


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah but people shift ranks all the time, knowing what happened to a single staff member isnt the end of the world


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
We've had too many leaking issues for you to tell me it's not a big deal


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
we arent even being too strict , we literally tell them all the time that they cant leak


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
at all


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They are only 2 weeks as an mr


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2 weeks my ass lol


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
I've been harassed by too many people who've been leaked to for you to tell me leaking isn't a big deal


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah plus if they're new, and they're fired just like that? ouch


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] bman#0435
^^


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But shes nni2


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
Nicole was literally in sketchy situations BEFORE she was hired


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] emma;#1525
and I told y'all not to hire her


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
there was an announcement TODAY


[29-Mar-20 10:13 PM] a. ღ#4222
ABOUT IT


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
and she was hired still


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Baby we literally had people fired in 30 minutes


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] a. ღ#4222
**today**


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; the things that get leaked are so minor that most of the the time they would not effect the group at all


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
2 weeks is nothing compared to previous cases


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
That's litearlly not the POINT ethan


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Yeah like why are things like this our focus?? Its so minor


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@a. ღ this is a new MR they weren’t explicitly told that is considered leaking


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] emma;#1525
We have a hard enough time drawing the fine line between what's considered leaking and what's not already, when the line is literally "Sending anything from staff channels is leaking"


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because we told them not to share that info??


[29-Mar-20 10:14 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It only mentions screenshots in bmana guide


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
@RAMMGaming MINN LITERALLY SAID YOU WOULD BE FIRED FOR LEAKING THE TERMINATION REASON... IN THE THING SHE LEAKED


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
LMAO


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did you guys even read the announcements Minn shared


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
tf you mean she didn't knkow


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] a. ღ#4222
im pretty sure weve said it many times


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
I mean, if it was just her telling someone they were terminated and why that's fine, but literally taking a photo of an announcement made specifically for MRs is a bigger issue.


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
trey made an announcem,ent before they leaked too ithink


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
What announcement


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
trey-


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
The one you made today-


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
omfg


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
Trey-


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
I CANT


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
TREYYYYYYY


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] ethan;#0003
i got an idea, we just dont penalize if they leak stuff like this. But if they leak stuff like, MR confidental only info like the CB list ect... then we take action like suspension of termination of rank


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
can you not clown me for 5 seconds


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
NOT RIGHT NOWWWWWW


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
i literally asked a simple question


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
don't get smart with me


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
Ethan there is literally no way that will decrease leaking


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
how am i being smart with u-


[29-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
Because people will be like "Oh I didn't think xyz was confidential"


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
They already pull that crap


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] bman#0435
ok i just wont get into this conversation


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
With stuff that we've clearly said is confidential


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They pull that shit all the damn time lol


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
such as TERMINATION REASON


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Especially people like KawiP


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
And you guys are gonna be liek "Oh they didn't know!" but they did know bc we've said it 200 times


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] emma;#1525
🤦‍♀️


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm sorry but


[29-Mar-20 10:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I feel like this is giving them the special treatment


[29-Mar-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
I really don't care if you guys think this is a "dumb" reason to fire her, or even suspend her, because we already voted to fire her and we got BOD approval so if you're really against it you can all vote to suspend instead and we can see if that wins instead of a termination


[29-Mar-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
But it's not dumb that we're trying to stop people from leaking important things by preventing all types of leaking


[29-Mar-20 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
Make a new vote for it.


[29-Mar-20 10:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why would we tho


[29-Mar-20 10:17 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't get it


[29-Mar-20 10:17 PM] emma;#1525
Because there's 0 way for us to stop leaking by saying "You can leak *this* but not *this* but if it's *this* it's fine and if it's *this* it's not fine"


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
People can't even read 2 PMs and keep it straight let alone 20 caveats that make leaking okay


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
This was to one person


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
What types of leaking are you guys trying to prevent with this rule


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] ethan;#0003
they wouldnt know because we wouldnt tell them what cant be leaked, we just wouldnt punish them for it


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
RAMM that was towards an LR


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Like what would be worst case scenario of someone leaking?


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yes but it was one person


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Who asked a question.


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That one person could've spreaded that type of info


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe Well we've already had HRs being harassed bc they've leaked announcements and documents with information


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It wasn’t like it was her leaking to her friend


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
like the cb doc


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Even tho we said **NOT** to


[29-Mar-20 10:18 PM] ethan;#0003
@babymariobebe the CB list got leaked the other day probaly the most major thing i a while that was leaked


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It just seems like a mistake…


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
whats wrong with leaking a cb list exactly


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
Trey's still being harassed for an announcement he made that got leaked


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
like


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If we aren't going to follow Minn's regulation, we have some work to do


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
6 months ago


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal bman getting harassed


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
its explicitly mr only


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
unless you like your HRs getting harassed lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
which i doubt you do


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
bc that's just not fun


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
cbs get ahold of it, harass me about it, then i delete it and make a new one


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
lol


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
no but like cbs are simply users with multiple accounts right


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] babymariobebe#7563
ya


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yup


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
mhm


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] a. ღ#4222
because bman gets fucking harassed from the cb list being leaked


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] Beartikal#9760
so how is a list of them private info


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Some of them get MR y'know


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] emma;#1525
Can y'all improve your FE anti exploits stuff while you're at it


[29-Mar-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
annoying trollers


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
we're being exploited left and right


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
thanks


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
that's probably a bigger issue than this leaking thing


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because they harass us over it??


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
Someone legit asked me for a CB list today and like no. LRs will leak it to the CBs and the CBs will attack Bman and us even more and make new CB accounts with different names that's not on the list.


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal tbh idk bman said it was private beacuse he made it so we are just going along with it


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
understood - but its a list of players like lets be honest here lol


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We're not dealing what we had last summer


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ok lets announce to mrs


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] bman#0435
because its only be sent in the mr channels and not publicly announced


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
if they're harassing you **discord has this magical thing called a block button, make use of it**


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] babymariobebe#7563
😮


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
It's private bc if CBs know how we identify them, they will know exactly how *not* to dress up and behave and then we won't be able to identify them


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
U can tell everyone everything in staff annoucements


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
@babymariobebe Omg but people can join the BH server on alts and they don't even need to verify to be able to DM us!!!


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I hope you realize they make like 10 more accounts fam @babymariobebe


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] emma;#1525
So we can be harassed on alts!!!


[29-Mar-20 10:20 PM] bman#0435
ya i block them but they make alts to do it lol


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
cbs exploit - we can see exploits - regardless of how they dress


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] bman#0435
amiee


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] bman#0435
the annoying cb girl from summer


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
They don't all exploit


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
Most of them don't exploit


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
Actually


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] bman#0435
go check her bans in the bh server


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] bman#0435
u will see why


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Us blocking them is not going to fix the problem lol


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
They troll, spam, harass us and our staff...


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
Make people not want to work here...


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
The one that exploits its cause her dad made it for her


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
they love to wear rediculout outfits its simple


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
lol


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You forgot them doxing @emma;


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
then ignore them idk? I get hate mail every day and I just close the DM and typically they stop replying. The only reason people harass others is for attention, so don't give them any.


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal You egg them on


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
So sorry that I don't really appreciate your advice on how it's easy to deal with them lol


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Not too hard


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Beartikal#9760
actually


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Baby it's not that simple


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] emma;#1525
WHen I've watched you encourage them to be ridiculous


[29-Mar-20 10:21 PM] bman#0435

[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] emma;#1525

[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Why did you guys even try to ban them all


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] ethan;#0003
that is every discord ban on the server.... that is just not amiee


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] babymariobebe#7563
thats insane


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
They follow us in Stapleton, the actual hotel, etc


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Because that's our job??


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I cleared practically most of them


[29-Mar-20 10:22 PM] bman#0435
ban


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
a repetitive cycle


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] ethan;#0003
YES LMAO I ROASTED ONE SO HARD A FEW WEEKS AGO


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
i wonder what would happen if you guys stopped banning
would they continue?
hmmm


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
I appreciate you two wanting to give us advice on dealing with these situations but we literally deal with them **every single day** while you guys are building new games and stuff (which is great and idc, we have enough people to do admin work)


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
yes


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
yes they would


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We stopped circumventing x2


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
we let them appeal at one point


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Didn't work


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
and they still did


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal i tried that before, they continue but stop. They only do it because they "like to be banned"


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye we let sadder and swan back


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
They do it for attention, they don't care if they get banned or not


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
ya thats what I think


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
we started reporting them to roblox and one got banned because they constantly bypassed at the hotel


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But both are bad


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
We've let them appeal, we've kept them blacklisted


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It's a lose-lose situation really


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok but yeah i love knocking them in the floor i mut say


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525
They only stop when they want to stop


[29-Mar-20 10:23 PM] emma;#1525

[29-Mar-20 10:24 PM] bman#0435

Nicole leaked. What should we do? **Results will wait for Minn to give his input since some of  y'all don't care that Bloo already approved this, which sucks but oh well we'll wait for Minn anyways I guess.**

[29-Mar-20 10:30 PM] Beartikal#9760

[29-Mar-20 10:30 PM] bman#0435
her dad coded her exploits for her


[29-Mar-20 10:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
@emma; which exploit did she use to say that?


[29-Mar-20 10:31 PM] emma;#1525

[29-Mar-20 10:33 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
what did she try to gain with that lmao


[29-Mar-20 10:34 PM] ethan;#0003
most of those scam invites the owner of the server does a giveaway like "most invites in 1 hour wins robux"


[29-Mar-20 10:34 PM] bman#0435
i assume she tried to gain 2500 robux


[29-Mar-20 10:34 PM] bman#0435
just a guess


[29-Mar-20 10:35 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So from the votes


[29-Mar-20 10:35 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
It seems termination won


[29-Mar-20 10:35 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So its a fire


[29-Mar-20 10:35 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

baby said no, why are you all trying to go above him and still fire him


[29-Mar-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
thats all


[29-Mar-20 10:37 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Cause we do votes

noob


[29-Mar-20 10:37 PM] ethan;#0003
but baby is a higher rankk then everyone of us, he would always have the final say


[29-Mar-20 10:38 PM] ethan;#0003
he owns the group


[29-Mar-20 10:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
But its what the votes say


[29-Mar-20 10:38 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
And all of us do administrative stuff daily


[29-Mar-20 10:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Why not now just cause higher rank says no


[29-Mar-20 10:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Democracy is needed if not we all no need to have say in anything anymore


[29-Mar-20 10:39 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
1 man show


[29-Mar-20 10:39 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Ethan that’s like saying we’re nothing.


[29-Mar-20 10:40 PM] bman#0435
leila leaked the cb doc apparently too


[29-Mar-20 10:40 PM] bman#0435
so


[29-Mar-20 10:40 PM] bman#0435
shes setting herself up


[29-Mar-20 10:40 PM] bman#0435
at this point


[29-Mar-20 10:41 PM] ethan;#0003
im just saying baby usualy doesnt step in like this, and since he did he didnt like how we where handeling it so he stepped in


[29-Mar-20 10:41 PM] bman#0435
someone probably complained about the final decision and thats why they both magically intervened


[29-Mar-20 10:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it was being handled like every other situation


[29-Mar-20 10:42 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
otherwise they can come and ping everyone and do an entire explanation on why not


[29-Mar-20 10:42 PM] bman#0435
we have the proof, we did the vote, we have the letter and notice ready


[29-Mar-20 10:42 PM] bman#0435
what more do u want us to do


[29-Mar-20 10:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
exactly


[29-Mar-20 10:42 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
see if all 7 of us who voted terminate


[29-Mar-20 10:42 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
will be convinced


[29-Mar-20 10:43 PM] bman#0435
considering she probably unconsciously leaked that information, who knows what more shes leaked


[29-Mar-20 10:45 PM] ethan;#0003
im just going to stay out of it then


[29-Mar-20 11:02 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
need to wait for minn


[30-Mar-20 12:22 AM] ethan;#0003

[30-Mar-20 12:22 AM] ethan;#0003
she has been in the game for hours


[30-Mar-20 12:30 AM] emma;#1525
@ethan; I value baby's opinion but seeing as he's literally hired us to do administrative work so he and bear can build new games and focus on scripting, I feel like we are better judgers of things like this seeing as we deal with them daily lol


[30-Mar-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
A group where the owner can lay down executive law and we all feel forced to follow it or fear being fired isn't one I want to be in, and I don't think that's the group baby and bear have created since we're all still clearly adamant about this course of action being the best even though it's not what they want


[30-Mar-20 12:31 AM] emma;#1525
which is *great* actually, it speaks volumes of our relationship lol


[30-Mar-20 12:32 AM] a. ღ#4222
so is nni2 getting in trouble?


[30-Mar-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack I guess we can wait for Minn to give his input tomorrow since he seems to be the "common judge" or whatever, and since it was his rule that was leaked anyways I'm interested to hear his side of this


[30-Mar-20 12:32 AM] emma;#1525
But since she has what, 7 votes to terminate...?


[30-Mar-20 12:33 AM] emma;#1525
It's unlikely she won't be fired at this point


[30-Mar-20 12:36 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
She has to go.


[30-Mar-20 12:37 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
At this point, I don't think she values our privacy.


[30-Mar-20 12:38 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
But let's see what Minn says, here's hoping this doesn't take too long.


[30-Mar-20 12:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Wait a minute, send photos?


[30-Mar-20 12:42 AM] stacey#1000
I thought she sent that.


[30-Mar-20 12:42 AM] stacey#1000
Or did she just tell people they were fired with reason


[30-Mar-20 12:42 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
^^^


[30-Mar-20 12:42 AM] stacey#1000
Well


[30-Mar-20 12:43 AM] stacey#1000
Let me reword that then


[30-Mar-20 12:43 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Either way, it was highly disrespectful just to share that info given the rules we sat down with her after her promotion.


[30-Mar-20 12:43 AM] stacey#1000
I personally think if termination announcements keep causing issues like this with leaking then we should stop announcement them altogether.


[30-Mar-20 12:44 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
But that'll just blow out transparency.


[30-Mar-20 12:44 AM] stacey#1000
We started announcing them for transparency for our MRs, as they want us to trust them I get that.


[30-Mar-20 12:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Okay, but how is it going to teach them a lesson?


[30-Mar-20 12:45 AM] stacey#1000
But, all I’m saying is if we get a lot of cases of them leaking the termination announcements then that goes to say we shouldn’t be announcing it because they are showing we cannot trust them with it. It’s fine right now because it’s only like 2-3 cases it’s happened.


[30-Mar-20 12:45 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
The point of announcements is to not only share transparency with them, but to basically let them know not to fall in the same trap as the user terminated.


[30-Mar-20 12:46 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think we should take it away, to be honest.


[30-Mar-20 12:46 AM] stacey#1000
I’m not saying taking away right now. I’m saying if it keeps happening then we should think about it.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] stacey#1000
I doubt it will keep happening though.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Maybe, but I don't think it's going to go very well.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Mhm.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I mean, the voting is pretty much lopsided.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] stacey#1000
I’m gonna make a google doc about leaking to send to people when I promote them and make it more complex.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
7 against 4.


[30-Mar-20 12:47 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
4*


[30-Mar-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
I went back and forth between suspension and termination.


[30-Mar-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
Who did she even tell


[30-Mar-20 12:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Well, an LR.


[30-Mar-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
Like I ain’t scrolling to find it all.


[30-Mar-20 12:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I think this is a huge risk considering that:


[30-Mar-20 12:48 AM] stacey#1000
Why wasn’t this in on-going investigations earlier so I could find the evidence easier....?


[30-Mar-20 12:49 AM] stacey#1000
I legit don’t even know. I thought she sent screenshots of the announcement.


[30-Mar-20 12:49 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
A) That info is going to spread around, I don't trust the LRs given how nosey they can be.


[30-Mar-20 12:49 AM] stacey#1000
But now that I know she just told someone they were fired and why then I might change my vote.


[30-Mar-20 12:50 AM] stacey#1000
Even though it would still be outvoted.


[30-Mar-20 12:50 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
B) The LR could be a CB, and you know how CBs blow situations out of proportion.


[30-Mar-20 12:51 AM] stacey#1000
Where’s the evidence of her leaking


[30-Mar-20 12:51 AM] stacey#1000
Like who reported it.

Now I might change my vote.


[30-Mar-20 12:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
To what?


[30-Mar-20 12:52 AM] stacey#1000
To suspension.


[30-Mar-20 12:52 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Why exactly?


[30-Mar-20 12:52 AM] stacey#1000
I mean there is good points to why she should be terminated as well.


[30-Mar-20 12:53 AM] stacey#1000
It’s debatable.


[30-Mar-20 12:53 AM] a. ღ#4222
i agree


[30-Mar-20 12:53 AM] stacey#1000

[30-Mar-20 12:53 AM] stacey#1000

[30-Mar-20 01:06 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
makes me feel like im not a bod


[30-Mar-20 01:09 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and the fact that trey literally made an announcement about leaking too and **today** too


[30-Mar-20 01:10 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but its like bman even stated in his rules not to leak


[30-Mar-20 01:10 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[30-Mar-20 01:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 01:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah it doesnt benefit us as a HR team


[30-Mar-20 01:26 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[30-Mar-20 01:29 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[30-Mar-20 01:29 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 01:29 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
because everything happens at 3am


[30-Mar-20 01:30 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ik i have to scroll through 500 messages sometimes just to find the ping that started the whole conversation


[30-Mar-20 01:32 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lmao


[30-Mar-20 01:32 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[30-Mar-20 01:32 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 01:36 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah emma


[30-Mar-20 01:37 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
saab needs to grow up


[30-Mar-20 01:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye shes 23


[30-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[30-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[30-Mar-20 01:44 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like 70% of these hrs here i dont think we've had one lmao


[30-Mar-20 01:45 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i think 2017 tbh... or maybe 2018


[30-Mar-20 01:45 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol 2017


[30-Mar-20 01:45 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
one of those years idk but its been a while


[30-Mar-20 01:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
@emma; I agree with an HR meeting but if you want to do it on VC then only Bloo would be able to host it


[30-Mar-20 01:49 AM] emma;#1525
I mean I'll host it lmao or stacey, it doesn't really need to be "hosted" someone just needs to plan it in advance


[30-Mar-20 01:49 AM] emma;#1525
so we have the topics laid out


[30-Mar-20 01:49 AM] emma;#1525
but the idea is equal contribution


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] emma;#1525
My plan was to make a google doc and everyone can put topics or rules they want discussed, one person organizes the document, and then during the meeting we have 1-2 people take notes


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] emma;#1525
and we can move on when the group feels comfortable


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
nah, i agree with u stacey


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] emma;#1525
instead of one person dictating it


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hm okay well Bloo doesnt mind speaking on VC we just need to know what material you want in the meeting


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] emma;#1525
why does bloo need to talk


[30-Mar-20 01:50 AM] emma;#1525
if people dont want to talk in VC they can talk in general


[30-Mar-20 01:51 AM] emma;#1525
and then those who are comfortable talking can talk


[30-Mar-20 01:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oo ok


[30-Mar-20 01:51 AM] a. ღ#4222
Oo


[30-Mar-20 01:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
Actually


[30-Mar-20 01:51 AM] emma;#1525
it's gonna be less chaotic to have it over a VC but ofc not everyone is comfortable talking so its ok if some people want to use general


[30-Mar-20 01:51 AM] xM_inn#2821
How about I get baby to make a channel for the meeting and the person who is going over a topic can talk in there while everyone else talks in general or VC


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
well it's not that kind of meeting


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
where one person is talking


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ik


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
it's more for us to have discussion about the topics people think we need to clarify


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
and rules we want implemented


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i dont think we need 1 person leading


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
But if we speak in general our messages are gonna get swept away


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
its just like this


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
open discussion


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
not if people are calm and dont spam lol


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hmm  ok


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] a. ღ#4222
I think a lot of hrs will tak tho


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] a. ღ#4222
Tak


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] emma;#1525
half the HRs are comfortable talking in VC so that'll make general a lot less crowded


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] a. ღ#4222
Talk


[30-Mar-20 01:52 AM] a. ღ#4222
god


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
its only like 15 of us anyways


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
Mk


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] emma;#1525
bc there's really nothing to "lecture" over like we would an MR meeting


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
Also


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
While I'm here


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
What happened with nicole


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] emma;#1525
She leaked the reasons why some people were terminated, which you've said in the past and we all have agreed is a cause for her to be terminated


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] emma;#1525
but a few people feel like its not a "big" enough reason to fire her


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] emma;#1525
even though we've had 2 votes


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] emma;#1525
and termination has won both times


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and shes new


[30-Mar-20 01:53 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
"new"


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
baby said he doesn't think its a good reason so a couple people think we shouldn't bc baby said no


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
but with all due respect


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
Did she send screenshots or was it just the reasoning


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
i think our vote counts more


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
just the reasoning to our knowledge


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
"xyz was fired for this reason"


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hmm okay and did she come to you about it or did she make you figure it out


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
Someone reported it


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
SHe didn't come to us


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmm


[30-Mar-20 01:54 AM] emma;#1525
Cam received the report


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
Again we had 2 votes and both times termination won


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
even after a lot of discussion both times


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
with some people being against it


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
and Bloo approved termination btw so we did get a BOD approval


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
Well the thing is, we've fired people for this in the past, so we need very good reasoning if we're not firing her for it too


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
Good I agree 100%


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
It's the precedent we've set


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] emma;#1525
Idk why that's such an issue with some people lol


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok now?


[30-Mar-20 01:55 AM] a. ღ#4222
We make clear not to leak


[30-Mar-20 01:56 AM] a. ღ#4222
It clear *


[30-Mar-20 01:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
If she's leaked once, she's only gonna leak again


[30-Mar-20 01:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
And also


[30-Mar-20 01:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
In the announcements, it literally says at the bottom that leaking will result in termination


[30-Mar-20 01:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
I get shes new, but its not like you can accidentally leak


[30-Mar-20 01:56 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i agree


[30-Mar-20 01:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok


[30-Mar-20 01:57 AM] emma;#1525
Yeah that was our whole point, literally in the announcement she leaked it says "if you leak this reason you will be fired"


[30-Mar-20 01:57 AM] emma;#1525
so there's no way it was an accident lol


[30-Mar-20 01:57 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
mack


[30-Mar-20 01:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[30-Mar-20 01:57 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hmm


[30-Mar-20 01:58 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
NOTICE OF TERMINATION

Dear Bloxton MRs,

As part of our efforts in being transparent, I regret to inform you all that nicoleeqz has been terminated from her position as Head of Services due to leaking. We take leaking here seriously and as said above, the information sent in Staff Announcements is for MR browsing only. Any form of leaking will result in a termination.

If you have any questions or concerns, please direct them to me as I will be opening my DMs for a short while. Take note that leaking this announcement to any non-MR will also result in a termination from your position.

Yours sincerely,
Mackpacker
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels


[30-Mar-20 01:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Mhm, I mean if you really want, you guys could talk to her before you fire her, though I dont see it being very effective. Just make sure you suspend her before you talk to her so she doesnt leak anything else


[30-Mar-20 01:58 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
you think i dont have this readyyyy


[30-Mar-20 01:58 AM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
Did baby specifically say we're not allowed to fire her


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

too late


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oh ok


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
LOL


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
lol


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
Well


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
she wanna knows


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
what was leaked


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
Technically he kind of maybe said no


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
SHE DIDNT EVEN READ


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
WHAT I SAID


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
But he's never had involvement in our jobs before


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
And I don't believe in us being a dictatorship


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
So we did a second vote


[30-Mar-20 01:59 AM] emma;#1525
And termination still won


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] emma;#1525
"They will remain their rank with no action necessary, there is nothing wrong with knowing why another staff member was fired??"


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] emma;#1525
is what was *technically* said


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
Well we all agree with a firing so I think we can let that slide on this occasion, but if he wants to look into the strictness side of things we can definitely work on that


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] a. ღ#4222
ok well would’ve been nice to know that a few terminations ago


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] emma;#1525
That's the whole point of an **HR meeting**


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] emma;#1525
so we can discuss what rules we like and what rules we think can change


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
there is actually nothing wrong with knowing why another staff member was fired


[30-Mar-20 02:00 AM] emma;#1525
but last time I wanted to have one the BODs told me noooooooooooooo


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] emma;#1525
even though we all voted to have one


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the problem is this is mr telling an lr


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
then the lr can go bla bla all around


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] emma;#1525
the problem is her breaking a rule that she legit had to read in order to know why that person was fired


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] emma;#1525
lmao


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
nicole ♡Today at 3:01 PM
Is there any proof of this? I'm just a little confused.

[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
time to do some mspaint


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
she responded so fast


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] xM_inn#2821
Mk well we can definitely have an HR meeting and I'm gonna see if theres anything baby would like to address regarding strictness or anything else


[30-Mar-20 02:01 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i thought it was gonna take her until tomorrow to say something


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
baby thinks we're too strict at interviews


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
even tho we've legit changed our rules to be less strict


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
like


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
3 times lol


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
baby and bear should come to the meeting


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
if they really want to have a say in the administrative side of things


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] stacey#1000
If possible, I think it would benefit if baby and bear cane to the meeting


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
bc if they want to just be builders and not help us with anything that's great but i dont think they should have much of a say in what we do if they aren't gonna help us out


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
do i clear out the pfp too


[30-Mar-20 02:02 AM] emma;#1525
and i'd love for them to give us more input bc it is their group


[30-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
but idk how we can do what they want if they never involve themselves with what we do lol


[30-Mar-20 02:03 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[30-Mar-20 02:03 AM] xM_inn#2821
New interview questions would be nice


[30-Mar-20 02:03 AM] emma;#1525
and then just call us too strict

great im not dumb


[30-Mar-20 02:10 AM] bman#0435
unless its the actual app


[30-Mar-20 02:10 AM] bman#0435
where she cant refresh or edit


[30-Mar-20 02:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 02:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

so its invalid


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] xM_inn#2821

[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
Phew


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] bman#0435
did yall remove her rank yet tho


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
Good


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
she said shes using the app


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
do you need entire window


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yes


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] bman#0435
ok well theres no way she can refresh on the app tho


[30-Mar-20 02:11 AM] xM_inn#2821
Full screenshot of her desktop


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
you also cant edit on the app


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
tho


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] xM_inn#2821
^


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
and she could take a vid of her closing the app


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
and reopening it


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] xM_inn#2821
So now we just need to prove shes on the app


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] emma;#1525
bc that would "refresh" if she did somehow edit on app


[30-Mar-20 02:12 AM] bman#0435
u can?

Well I'm not bothered about her friend knowing


[30-Mar-20 02:14 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i think she told her friend about it cause it was sketchy


[30-Mar-20 02:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
But


[30-Mar-20 02:14 AM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 02:14 AM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 02:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
The guy who reported it needs blacklisting

if she wasn't then you woulda announced her termination


[30-Mar-20 02:23 AM] emma;#1525
and then you would have had to retract it


[30-Mar-20 02:23 AM] stacey#1000
Man why am I even up at 3:23am


[30-Mar-20 02:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
That's all I have. I was just uncomfortable that she shared the reason for Lucas blacklisting.


[30-Mar-20 02:23 AM] emma;#1525
😳


[30-Mar-20 02:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we need to find out who that guy is


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] stacey#1000
Maybe new thing should be no matter what a thing is, always suspend and question people


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] bman#0435
how did he find out the information then


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
a whole new case just poofed


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
darrenafro-


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] stacey#1000
Like doesn’t matter what it is. If someone is gonna he fired they need to be questioned first about why.


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
seems like a fan of darren and trey


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] bman#0435
LOL


[30-Mar-20 02:25 AM] bman#0435
and cam


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] stacey#1000
That’s what I was saying to trey earlier


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] emma;#1525
the guy that account is following is following a bunch of old HRs


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
I TOLD U THAT GUY LOOKED LIKE AN ALT


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg plot twist it’s trey and Darren working together


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] stacey#1000
I said “She deserves the chance to be questioned because you can’t assume stuff without knowing her side”


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] a. ღ#4222
Better question is, that guy knows how they both were fired , so does that mean someone leaked to him ? Or does it mean it’s an mr- like ?


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] stacey#1000
So yeah


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
omg..... fired trey


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] stacey#1000
It could be a former MR


[30-Mar-20 02:26 AM] bman#0435
that account is following one account and its him

[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
Just saying


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
cinder has little reason to care anymore


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
but fair


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
he was sloppy as fuck with cam lol


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
I mean not rly


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
The proof looked so real


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
i mean if i wasn't as experienced as i am


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
i would have believed it


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] stacey#1000
And plus, Alex himself was telling people why he was fired too so...


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
100%


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the proof looked damn real


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] a. ღ#4222
The explanation killed him


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
then what about everything else lmao


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
bc cinder knows how to make people feel dumb for believing things


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ok


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
jordyn


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
"omg you can't edit a video emma are you dumb"


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
"ive never heard of an exploit that makes other people talk"


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
Why did Cinder want Cam fired tho


[30-Mar-20 02:27 AM] emma;#1525
"do you really think meow can exploit LMAO"


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
meanwhile story and i didn't fall in his bullshit lol


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] bman#0435
that second one is so funny


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] bman#0435
apparently him and meow have always been targetting him


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
Kinda coincidental it happens a few days before his shift promo


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] bman#0435
according to cam


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] xAfroTrey#9464

[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ohhhh


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] emma;#1525
@PackItUpMack Tell jordan that nicole was involved in the lucas case from a non-BH perspective, and if she chooses to share her own personal story she's within her rights to do that since what she sent was her own


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
I bet cinder was so happy when cam got shift then


[30-Mar-20 02:28 AM] bman#0435
so so happy


[30-Mar-20 02:29 AM] emma;#1525
i haven't heard a peep from cinder yet


[30-Mar-20 02:29 AM] emma;#1525
which probably means something very very bad


[30-Mar-20 02:29 AM] emma;#1525
but im choosing to ignore that


[30-Mar-20 02:29 AM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 02:29 AM] stacey#1000

[30-Mar-20 12:47 PM] Cooqkie#2809

[30-Mar-20 12:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank @Unknown is suspended for being hacked but still wants to chat in general discussion so I gave her talkative role

bethhzn (musicalyaddiction) for those on mobile

@Cooqkie i said i didnt know either


[30-Mar-20 01:41 PM] bman#0435
@High Rank I know this is a long shot, and I believe we should try a vote on her again, however Swan would like to appeal her ban. If you haven't noticed, she was last banned November 21st, 2019. Since then, she has MAJORLY matured and is currently an MR at SB. I understand if you disagree, however I believe she deserves a chance for an appeal again.

[30-Mar-20 01:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
No thanks.


[30-Mar-20 01:42 PM] bman#0435
i mention the mr at sb part because communication, alliances, blah blah


[30-Mar-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad she improved from another group.


[30-Mar-20 01:42 PM] bman#0435
trey did u even read anything


[30-Mar-20 01:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yes, I did.


[30-Mar-20 01:42 PM] bman#0435
i feel like u just read "swan" and went straight to a disagreement


[30-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Thanks for the assumption.


[30-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Now, can I express why I disagree?


[30-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
Give her some more time.


[30-Mar-20 01:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's not say no entirely.


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's just say we'd like to reconsider our options in a few months.


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And give her a 3rd chance? I don't think so.


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
We don't have to let her appeal.


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
But we also don't have to just straight-up say no to her.


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's be reasonable. It's what we did with Harriet.


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] emma;#1525
Yeah no


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] emma;#1525
Not right now


[30-Mar-20 01:44 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Did what with Harriet?


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525
Not after she got appealed last time and screwed us over


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@Beartikal bear ppl r saying in all hotel servers the commands to give and take rooms arent working but the self checkin is working


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
We said we'd like to reconsider our options in a few months.


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
@xAfroTrey


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xM_inn#2821
Instead of just saying no.


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn we didn’t straight up say no to Harriet bc we worried saying no to her meant she would start trolling again


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't think we should reconsider.


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525
It had nothing to do with us actually thinking Harriet could earn an appeal


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] emma;#1525
Lmao


[30-Mar-20 01:45 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like, if she screwed up multiple times, there's really no point in having her back.


[30-Mar-20 01:46 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
If we did this to former MRs, I believe she should face the same thing.


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
If she’s matured that’s great but it’s not like sizzle does ally visits that much so is swan really gonna be missing out on anything


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
No


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
And that’s not our problem anyways


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
Months of trolling and targeting us was a choice she made so she can live with not being able to visit us


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
And she can explain to her HR team why she can’t attend ally visits with us


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
And they will give 0 shots


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
Shits


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
And it’s all good


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
0 shots


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] emma;#1525
Shut up I’m on mobile


[30-Mar-20 01:48 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] bman#0435

[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Cam#5887
im sure ill figure it out tho someday


[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] Cam#5887
xd


[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] emma;#1525
AND WE MADE A DOC AND SENT IT TO SB


[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] emma;#1525
So they could FIRE HER


[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] emma;#1525
and they did for a day


[30-Mar-20 01:49 PM] emma;#1525
Then she appealed and LIED IN HER APPEAL


[30-Mar-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
and got her rank back


[30-Mar-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
So I talked to this HR chick for like


[30-Mar-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
A few days


[30-Mar-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525
And they decided to keep Harriet as an ME


[30-Mar-20 01:50 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
oh yeah congrats btw @xM_inn


[30-Mar-20 01:50 PM] emma;#1525

Appeal
Former MR Appeal  Username: eliyafa14 Reason: Disrespect towards a HR and MR.   You should give me back my former MR role at Bloxton hotel’s server because I would like a fresh new start at Bloxton Hotels. I will be completely honest, I was a fool and I was very immature and I...

@High Rank 

**HIGH RANK MEETING** 

After a year or 2 of not having a well needed High Rank team meeting, I’ll be organizing one alongside with Emma. The past couple of months have been filled with a lot of unclarity on issues and situations where we don’t entirely know what is suspension worthy or even with the leaking situations. We all have different thoughts on that even though rules were set in place. We’re also gonna talk about a lot of other things you guys may think that is important for this team. This High Rank meeting will put us all on the same page, to discuss our differences, ideas, and what we all as a team can do better, to better ourselves and Bloxton. 

Now, since were all on Coronacation, I know most of us still have things to do, like online school work, and it would beneficial if we can try to strive to get everyone there. I was thinking we can host this sometime next week, now we just need to figure out a day and time. Now we also wanna think about all the HR’s like our GMT And SGT HR’s. Pls give ur thoughts.


[30-Mar-20 04:16 PM] ethan;#0003

We’re gonna do it over VC


[30-Mar-20 04:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Not everyone has to talk btw. We have a good split in the middle between HR’s who like to talk and who may be shy so.

Where people can discuss things, not just certain people, at least thats the idea I got from last night.


[30-Mar-20 04:21 PM] stacey#1000
Thats what is suppose to be I thought


[30-Mar-20 04:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^


[30-Mar-20 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
Also, make it on a Saturday if possible or Sunday so it's a weekend


[30-Mar-20 04:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Besides there is only 15 of us. It won’t be hectic at all, I think anyone who wants to speak about an issue should have the chance to and we all give our inputs


[30-Mar-20 04:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
19*


[30-Mar-20 04:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oops


[30-Mar-20 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly, cause I know for sure I will be bringing up some points and discussing things


[30-Mar-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
@bman the whole point is for everyone to talk


[30-Mar-20 04:24 PM] bman#0435
i thougjt it was for u guys to clarify everything


[30-Mar-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
it doesn't make sense for only me and bloo to be talking because the idea is that we will all be discussing improvements that we can make or ideas we can build upon


[30-Mar-20 04:24 PM] emma;#1525
no


[30-Mar-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
not at all lol


[30-Mar-20 04:25 PM] bman#0435
o lol


[30-Mar-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
we can't clarify anything bc we need to agree on things as a team


[30-Mar-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
which is impossible to do bc no one is ever on at the same time


[30-Mar-20 04:25 PM] emma;#1525
hence the meeting


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It doesn't have to be everyone talking @bman


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’m also going to make a google doc and have you guys put your ideas on what you may wanna talk about at the meeting so we know what we’re gonna talk about and we can make a list and cross out as we go


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
We can mainly split the topics


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
trey-


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
that's not-


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
ok


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
do you guys not understand the point of this meeting


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Not what Emma?


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
we need to make it SGT friendly for mack


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Might as well spit it out now.


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
we aren't "splitting topics" we're all discussing things *together*


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] bman#0435
no i know that i just thought it was emma and bloo clarifying the most common confusions


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
"spit it out now"


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
the fuck


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] emma;#1525
are you okay


[30-Mar-20 04:27 PM] stacey#1000
so maybe like 10am est idk


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
it will have to be earlier for est if mack is gonna go


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You literally cut off when you said "that's not-"


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
You said it already


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
If you're having sass though for no reason I don't need that lol "spit it out" is literally such a rude thing to say


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
she doesnt want us to “split topics”


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
But anyways


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
spit it out


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
How is that rude?


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] bman#0435
wut


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey I will not be awake for a 9 am meeting


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't get it.


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
"Spit it out" is literally a rude statement trey


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
That's what people say when they're being impatient and want to get something over with


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
lol


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
we wait to see what best time is for Mack then


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] emma;#1525
If that's not what you meant okay but it came off very rude


[30-Mar-20 04:28 PM] a. ღ#4222
i think he means like


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
might as well get it out now


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
or


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
idk


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
That's what I meant, Story.


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
Well using a better phrasing is much appreciated


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Fair enough.


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
Bc that sounded extremely rude and I was put off by it lol


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] bman#0435
ugh y do i have the best things to say at the worst times 🙄🙄🙄


[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
If mack is willing to stay up a bit late, we could do it around 12 PM EST


[30-Mar-20 04:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Time is not confirmed yet but next weekend, anyone busy?

[30-Mar-20 04:56 PM] Polk#1596
Okay, so I know it is not a competition to host the most amount of sessions every week, but I still want to give you guys creds for hosting so many sessions last week. Everyone that hosted *(except three noobs.. Ramm - 1, Bonnie - 2, Mack - 3)* managed to get **10-20+** servers each! The top five were:

1. Stacey - **57**

2. Bman - **43**

3. Trey - **31**

4. Ethan - **27**

5. Bliss - **23**

I don't know if these big numbers come from coronatimez, but it is still very impressive! Even our new HR that only got hired on Saturday managed to get 17 sessions in just 2 days. That is extremely good, so I can't wait to see what he gets next week. In the Department of Corrections (Stapleton), we do a vote every week for the Officer of the Week. I got very excited when I won Officer of the Month *flex*, so just for the fun of it, Stacey will be our HR of the Week!! Keep it up noobs @High Rank


[30-Mar-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525
i got 10 servers??


[30-Mar-20 04:56 PM] emma;#1525

[30-Mar-20 05:13 PM] bman#0435
dont u think its like way too early for him to appeal


[30-Mar-20 05:13 PM] bman#0435
does not feel like its been a month


[30-Mar-20 05:13 PM] ethan;#0003
@emma; is that xLuvcas?


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
its been exactly a month


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
i think


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
feb 29th


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
i believe was his demotion date


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
believe it or not lol it's somehow been a full month, i agree it doesnt feel like that


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] bman#0435
o no he wasnt demoted


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] bman#0435
he resigned before we could take action


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
@ethan; yes


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
ok


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
blacklisted


[30-Mar-20 05:14 PM] emma;#1525
pls just vote


[30-Mar-20 05:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Damn this is quite long


[30-Mar-20 05:15 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I like the Far Cry 3 reference but that's not the point


[30-Mar-20 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
hasnt even been a full month since his blacklist and people have still been complaining about him even after he was fired, doesnt seem to me exactly that he has changed, I think he needs more time


[30-Mar-20 05:16 PM] stacey#1000
or "resigned" to not get fired


[30-Mar-20 05:16 PM] bman#0435
he goes so off track and literally wants us to take pity into him. did yall not see how much bs was said in the second paragraph lmfao


[30-Mar-20 05:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
It was a month


[30-Mar-20 05:16 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Lemme read this more so I can come up with a decision


[30-Mar-20 05:17 PM] stacey#1000
well I still vote no as I believe what he did requires A LOT more time to appeal, I read his appeal and he seems apologetic  but I still feel its too soon, I still see him as a pedophile


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
" I really am better than that. I want to show that I once was Lucas, the kind of guy you could have trusted."


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt even read it tbh


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
its so long


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not sure I like that sentence


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
its barely been a month


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
he literally sexually harassed girls


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] bman#0435
HIS DOC IS SO BS LMFAOOOOO


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Was he really a pedophile though


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
i didnt even want to vote on it but in the essence of democracy here we are


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
he's not old enough to be considered a pedophile


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like he's under 18 if I'm correct


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
bc he's still a child himself lol


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
i think


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[30-Mar-20 05:18 PM] emma;#1525
but he can still sexually harass girls


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
but  still


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
There’s a point you need to look at yourself, look at what you have, and ask yourself  “Am I worthy?” Am I worthy of being here? Was I put here for a reason?


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] bman#0435
THIS AINT NO DR SEUSS DEPRESSION STORY


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] emma;#1525
THAT SOUNDS LIKE JACK


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] emma;#1525
LMAO


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
I think for what he did requires more time


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[30-Mar-20 05:19 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm not liking how he split it into two appeals


[30-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The problem with the appeal is that its really long and very overcomplicated


[30-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I get that he tried his best and all but


[30-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Sentences like what Bman quoted seems really overdramatic


[30-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I like the remorse but


[30-Mar-20 05:20 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
I'm gonna say no


[30-Mar-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He tried but like


[30-Mar-20 05:21 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
He did it way too hard


[30-Mar-20 05:22 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
And I don't really like how he thrown in depression in the mix


[30-Mar-20 05:28 PM] Polk#1596
That is so many words


[30-Mar-20 05:28 PM] Polk#1596
I'm glad that he truly regrets it but


[30-Mar-20 05:28 PM] Polk#1596
I still disagreed


[30-Mar-20 05:30 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Yeah I'm in the same stance

if i delete the cookies from my computers does that mean the passwords will be unsaved and i have to re-login to everythung again

[30-Mar-20 06:31 PM] bman#0435
yeah, someone tried hacking into my roblox account this morning and i know who, but the account was an alternative :/


[30-Mar-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887
yeah that would remove all passwords


[30-Mar-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887
more than likely


[30-Mar-20 06:32 PM] Cam#5887

0 staff are listening to the rule that they need to tell the person they want to report to use grammar, and also they need to tell the person to put the unifrom on


[30-Mar-20 07:40 PM] ethan;#0003
and they are also supposed to have proof of them asking them to put it on


[30-Mar-20 07:40 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Mar-20 07:40 PM] bman#0435

[30-Mar-20 08:05 PM] bman#0435
is "fiftyshadesofgaeys" an inapprorpiate username? not sure what it means but bella is asking me


[30-Mar-20 08:12 PM] Cam#5887
that user passed in one of my sessions, and honestly i didnt know either, but im assuming that it was ok, but idk


[30-Mar-20 08:12 PM] Cam#5887
i think as long as it was not used inappropriately, it was ok, because "fifty shades of __" are movies


[30-Mar-20 08:24 PM] bman#0435
@High Rank Not really sure how to feel about this, but I'm assuming there might be a glitch with the info command in displaying true information regarding safechat. I infoed BeeBeeBella, a current receptionist, and this is what the information showed.

I named her C7RN and had her say it, yet she doesn't have it. Just wanted to let y'all know about this just incase you planned on promoting or infoing someone in the near future.

[30-Mar-20 10:04 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Don't think its suspensionable but I think we should tell them to keep it to themselves


[30-Mar-20 10:05 PM] bman#0435
same with lanegorl and sebby


[30-Mar-20 10:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ya agreed, how should we go about it?


[30-Mar-20 10:05 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I can DM both of them just to tell them to keep it to themselves


[30-Mar-20 10:06 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

are you kidding me???


[30-Mar-20 10:15 PM] emma;#1525
yeah I think the best bet might just be to tell them that if they want to listen to romance songs and be lovey dovey then it needs to happen totally in private because it makes people uncomfortable to watch

@Hilton Founder hi guys please take extra precautions. this hacker has gained ownership of 6 groups, 2 being Venti and Outlander Studios, and i fear that Bloxton may be one of their 11 targets.


[31-Mar-20 01:53 AM] a. ღ#4222
they got 6/11


[31-Mar-20 01:53 AM] a. ღ#4222

[31-Mar-20 01:55 AM] Cam#5887

Changed my password as well


[31-Mar-20 07:05 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
@stacey can you help


[31-Mar-20 07:05 AM] stacey#1000
With what


[31-Mar-20 07:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
vintiie said his suspension is false


[31-Mar-20 07:06 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he didnt report steal at all


[31-Mar-20 07:07 AM] stacey#1000
Who’s vintiie


[31-Mar-20 07:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the former


[31-Mar-20 07:07 AM] stacey#1000
Is there a suspension card?


[31-Mar-20 07:07 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
yep


[31-Mar-20 07:07 AM] stacey#1000
Let me see

[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] stacey#1000
I mean the evidence shown looks like report stealing to me


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] stacey#1000
Did you look back at report channels itself?


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
yep


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i looked back


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] stacey#1000
And same thing?


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] Polk#1596
i dont really like the reason "report stealing"


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] Polk#1596
like honestly they couldve just been in the same server


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] Polk#1596
do you know if he can see the history of the report chat?


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
yes same thing


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] stacey#1000
I think report stealing should be just a warning


[31-Mar-20 07:09 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
background


[31-Mar-20 07:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
should i revoke it then


[31-Mar-20 07:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
cause hes freaking spamming me


[31-Mar-20 07:10 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
i take screenshots by lightshot
and exploit reports i do gyazo


[31-Mar-20 07:10 AM] Polk#1596
i mean it couldve just been a coincidence


[31-Mar-20 07:10 AM] stacey#1000
And if they report steal all the time to steal someone else’s credit and then a suspension. But if it’s a one time thing I think it should be just a warning


[31-Mar-20 07:10 AM] Polk#1596
hm


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
ye his report timings are few mins away


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
he wont be able to see other ppl reports


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
unless he camps at the troller reports channel


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] Polk#1596
have you guys ever made an announcement not to report something if it is already reported?


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] stacey#1000
Even if they are in the same server though they shouldn’t get the exact same photo as someone usually.


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] Polk#1596
because like he might not know that


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
nope


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] Polk#1596
stacey


[31-Mar-20 07:11 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
we never made an announcement like this


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] stacey#1000
No people still do it


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] Polk#1596
how are you supposed to get a different kind of screenshot of a chat


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
thats why 1 trello card can have 25+ attachments


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] Polk#1596
they both adjusted it differently so its hard to tell if it is stolen or not


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] stacey#1000
Like how do you get the exact same photo. Cropped the exact same way, with the exact same background of where you are in the hotel


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] Polk#1596
but i can clearly see the quality difference between the screenshots


[31-Mar-20 07:12 AM] Polk#1596
let me check again


[31-Mar-20 07:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
the background looks exact same


[31-Mar-20 07:13 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
and vintiie ones look less quality


[31-Mar-20 07:13 AM] Polk#1596
oh yeah thats true


[31-Mar-20 07:13 AM] Polk#1596
hm okay, i think i know what he did


[31-Mar-20 07:13 AM] Polk#1596
he looked at the reports, took a screenshot with gyazo which made the quality worse, then he downloaded it and put it in the channel


[31-Mar-20 07:13 AM] stacey#1000
Mhm


[31-Mar-20 07:14 AM] stacey#1000
Keep is suspension going as the evidence looks true and we haven’t changed any regulations on it yet so.


[31-Mar-20 07:14 AM] stacey#1000
We can discuss it during the HR meeting


[31-Mar-20 07:16 AM] stacey#1000
Plus it’s unprofessional for him to be spamming an HR Complaining.


[31-Mar-20 07:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
hes being very immature about it though


[31-Mar-20 07:16 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 07:16 AM] stacey#1000
Tell him it’s unprofessional to be spamming an HR about it complaining. The evidence is clear to me he stole 3 reports.


[31-Mar-20 07:17 AM] stacey#1000
You can send him the evidence too can’t you. The photos of reports he stole.


[31-Mar-20 07:23 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

So like wtf do they think they know


[31-Mar-20 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
Reporting someone who you think is blacklisted is not even a valid report


[31-Mar-20 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
Like


[31-Mar-20 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
You can’t just assume everyone is blacklisted. They don’t know wtf they are talking about


[31-Mar-20 11:10 AM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 11:10 AM] bman#0435

so im reporting u


[31-Mar-20 11:15 AM] bman#0435
@High Rank I don't even know if this is a valid report but at this moment I feel this could be a potential risk. MRs are encouraging other MRs to join the hackers Discord server. Again, I don't expect anything to be done about this, but they shouldn't be reacting this way with this situation.

[31-Mar-20 11:30 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 11:32 AM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 11:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
So i only eat dinner at like 9pm


[31-Mar-20 11:33 AM] stacey#1000

9pm is late to have dinner


[31-Mar-20 11:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 11:33 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I eat takeaway everyday now


[31-Mar-20 11:34 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
But my mom always comes home late


[31-Mar-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Quarantine life


[31-Mar-20 11:34 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
My dad comes back at like 6pm


[31-Mar-20 11:34 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
So what sessions do you want tomorrow if you want any


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I can just take 10


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
You can do the 11


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
Ok do you want it to be interviews or training


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
Ok


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
I dont like ints


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
So I’ll change my int


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
To 11


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] stacey#1000
And then you change the int to training at 10:20


[31-Mar-20 11:35 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ok


[31-Mar-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Wait I’ll just cancel int


[31-Mar-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
So I’ll cancel int and then you can take training and change time and SUB for it


[31-Mar-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
Then you get like 4-6 servers!!


[31-Mar-20 11:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
If i do sessions during normal sgt times, i get less


[31-Mar-20 11:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Probs also because singapore has no freaking school closure


[31-Mar-20 11:37 AM] stacey#1000
Hopefully there will be seniors on that time. Usually there is


[31-Mar-20 11:37 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Its usually anna


[31-Mar-20 11:38 AM] PackItUpMack#2361
Whats the reason to sub


[31-Mar-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000
Just say I can’t do it


[31-Mar-20 11:38 AM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] stacey#1000
Darren is resigning in July


[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Apparently Darren's gonna resign soon


[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
I don't like how he brings attention to it @stacey


[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
Like


[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] xAfroTrey#9464
"Hey guys care about me pls"


[31-Mar-20 11:48 AM] bman#0435
shes pretty much still a senior since we FORCE her to do stuff


[31-Mar-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
To get her to take my training server. But then she doesn’t actually host full servers usually


[31-Mar-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
She’s on a notice till April something


[31-Mar-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000
For whatever reason


[31-Mar-20 11:49 AM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 11:49 AM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 12:07 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Boho


[31-Mar-20 12:08 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
shouldn't we all come together and report him


[31-Mar-20 12:08 PM] bman#0435
so there is this hacker named vermcool who hacked HS_7 and Vitalious, stealing both of their groups and limiteds and robux. The dude has 11 targets, and so far has completed 6. we think bloxton MAY be a target but were not 100% sure, and we think this because he had joined the reports server but mack and i had found him and banned him. he stole HS' group and sold it for 2k USD, added an NSFW game to his account, and got him banned. he stole Vital's group, spent all the robux, exiled everyone, and closed the group.


[31-Mar-20 12:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] stacey#1000
Ban him from everything before he joins


[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye


[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] bman#0435
i said mine


[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think sebby himself is a risk


[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] stacey#1000
I didn’t think that he would like


[31-Mar-20 12:17 PM] stacey#1000
Be stupid and talk to hackers


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] stacey#1000
Someone archive my promotion card for him


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] katie#0200

[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] bman#0435
ok


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] ethan;#0003
If he joins bloxton just kick him from@the group instantly


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Oof sebby


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] stacey#1000
Just blacklist him before he even joins


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525
ok im legit gonna announce to MRs that if they're in verm's server or in contact with him i'm kicking them from the BH server due to it being a security risk


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] stacey#1000
Ban him rn


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
@Hilton Founder Watch ur back on the group


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
xoxo


[31-Mar-20 12:18 PM] bman#0435
one thing i fear is that if he gets a higher ranked position, he could demote us and we cant do anything about that at that point


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] ethan;#0003
Did the venti discord get shut down?


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder yes be careful your group is a target for these hackers.


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Ye


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
And made a vermsquad one


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435
deleted every channel and made one called "#verm-squad"


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435
then vital delted


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525
so he hacked into the discord account too


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
No idts


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I think its rover


[31-Mar-20 12:19 PM] bman#0435
because it seemed he had acc-


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
.


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
rover?


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Cause he got the owner position


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
r u sure...?


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So he can verify


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
he hacked into rover?


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
omg yes


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
As the owner


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
wait


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Of venti


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
rover was


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Instead of vitalious


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
ohhhhhhh


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
a thing before


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
ok


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
no


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
i understand


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Isnt that how we get the roles


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
...


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] Cam#5887
rover has been known to steal passwords before, not the one we are using but other ones, i remember this about a year ago


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
he demotes the higher ranked people who use their admin to warn the group


[31-Mar-20 12:20 PM] bman#0435
so


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] bman#0435
if we DO happen to have an issue with this, please dont go to the group status and change it saying not to worry and such


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] bman#0435
hs' co owner did that, then she was demoted to the lowest rank


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
If we get it will we become hilton v1 again..


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] bman#0435
andy did that for venti, then everyone got demoted


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] bman#0435
so take the smart route and dont use the group status or such


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
should we make a discord role that you can't get through rover


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
that baby and bear have


[31-Mar-20 12:21 PM] emma;#1525
or are their roles not connected through ro ver


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ethan;#0003
@Cam that was another verification bot


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
anyways


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
they arnet connected


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887
which is good that we have the other


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
no hr roles are connected to rover


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887
like


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bman#0435
ya its called founder


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887

[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] ethan;#0003
Not rover but ik what your talking about


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
ok cool so at least they wouldn't be able to delete our disc


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bman#0435
@emma;


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
Can we blacklist


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
This hacker guy


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
why vitalious had his owner role connected to rover i'll never understand


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
blacklist vermcool from getting a job?


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
Before he even joins the hotel


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
we can but he'll just make alts


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bman#0435
no he would be a great hr!!!!!


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Then hell become a cb


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
Just ban his ban acc


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] emma;#1525
roblox needs to IP ban him


[31-Mar-20 12:22 PM] bman#0435
lets promote him!


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] emma;#1525
or something


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
Like


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
then he can use a vpn


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
His main acc


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
roblox probably doesnt give a shit


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] emma;#1525
they'll have to give a shit if we get hacked lmao


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] emma;#1525
but it'll be too late by then


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
If all these groups are getting hacked


[31-Mar-20 12:23 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

but that doesn't necessarily matter when you're dealing with someone who really knows what they are doing


[31-Mar-20 12:27 PM] katie#0200
same


[31-Mar-20 12:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Ok


[31-Mar-20 12:27 PM] bman#0435
same


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
@babymariobebe hackers can go around 2 step


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
at one point we were all like required to have it since so many mrs and hrs were getting hacker


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; but they cant go around pin


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] bman#0435
so hide ur inventory so they cant steal ur lims


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] emma;#1525
you dont need a pin for a lot of stuff


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] babymariobebe#7563
No they cant unlews they have your whole dang email


[31-Mar-20 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
True


[31-Mar-20 12:29 PM] ethan;#0003
I’ll ask vital that


[31-Mar-20 12:29 PM] stacey#1000
This is why you add your phone number too in case your email is screwed


[31-Mar-20 12:29 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Also take note roblox is a web browser


[31-Mar-20 12:29 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Site


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] emma;#1525
i dont really want my phone number being attached to my account if im hacked bc you can legit stalk people with their phone number lol


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] stacey#1000
I added mine anyways


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
So the person can type in some SQL injections


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Or cross site scripting


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
it doesnt show ur whole phone numbe


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] ethan;#0003
I have 2 step on my google account also


[31-Mar-20 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
it replaces most of it with ***


[31-Mar-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
if a hacker is getting around 2 step verification and pins then im sure they can grab your phone number somehow if they really want to


[31-Mar-20 12:31 PM] stacey#1000
Well


[31-Mar-20 12:31 PM] stacey#1000
I can remove it still


[31-Mar-20 12:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Oof


[31-Mar-20 12:31 PM] emma;#1525
@stacey if vital had two step on, do you know if he got the "here's your access code" emails


[31-Mar-20 12:31 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
I have a backup number at least


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
from when verm logged in at a new location


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] emma;#1525
so that he was at least alerted to his account being hacked


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
If he got it from australia


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
It can match with bmans one


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
like bman got the other day


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] ethan;#0003
People said that the next groups verm is targeting is boba and frappe


[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591

And is related to bloxton


[31-Mar-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525
yoshi says he didnt get an email so yikes


[31-Mar-20 12:33 PM] ethan;#0003
You can figure it out if you ask HS_7 the ID of one of his limiteds and you can check what account that limited are on


[31-Mar-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
he says 6 targets done


[31-Mar-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
so


[31-Mar-20 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:33 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Venti outlander oasis


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Only these 3


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
it could be people too


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
the othe 3


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] PackItUpMack#2361
Maybe the other 3 arent groups


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003
It was HS_7, vital, venti, oasis resort,


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] emma;#1525
that he's counting in the 6


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] PackItUpMack#2361

Vital


[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591

[31-Mar-20 12:34 PM] ethan;#0003

[31-Mar-20 12:35 PM] ethan;#0003
He is in the nova group and a group called outlanders studio where he is ranked like special member


[31-Mar-20 12:35 PM] ethan;#0003
I think that outlander studio has something to do with his main accojnt@

[31-Mar-20 01:32 PM] emma;#1525
bc thats not a priority with a raid


[31-Mar-20 01:32 PM] ethan;#0003

MRs are asking if sessions are gonna be cancelled


[31-Mar-20 01:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
I don't think it's big enough to cancel sessions


[31-Mar-20 01:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
But whatever y'all think


[31-Mar-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
honestly, for the moment i think we should


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
every mr would rathe rpick trainings other the hotel


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
we need them at the hotel more right now


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
Well what if we just get Bloo to cancel his interviews for now then


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
And then there's no training until 10pm BST


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
Which is a good few hours


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
i think thatd be good


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@xM_inn can katie shutdown bc bonnies doing something random


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i didnt feel like doing interviews anyways


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LOL


[31-Mar-20 01:36 PM] emma;#1525
What can MRs even do for a raid though it's not like they can ban? It might be better to just have seniors spread out and give them admin


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
ya he kicked me before i could shutdown 😭


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
emma


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
if we give seniors admin


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
and they server hop


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
then u and the other gms and bods r gonna be hoppinf anf hopping around


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] emma;#1525
that's why I said spread out rat 🤦‍♀️


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] emma;#1525
so at least they will be able to cover a few servers


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] emma;#1525
and we wont have to deal with those servers


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
urmissing my point noob


[31-Mar-20 01:37 PM] xM_inn#2821

between all of our timezones we're monitored basically 24/7


[31-Mar-20 01:51 PM] emma;#1525
so we all just need to keep an extra eye out


[31-Mar-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
check audit logs every once in a while


[31-Mar-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
and i think its important that HRs aren't on fake offline


[31-Mar-20 01:52 PM] emma;#1525
so that people know who they can contact in case of an emergency


[31-Mar-20 01:52 PM] xM_inn#2821

**DECLINE OF FRIENDSHIP**

Hello, BmanPlays!

As sad as it may seem, but I am announcing that our friendship has officially come to a close as of 3:32 PM. I don't think that us both make a good pair nor do we get along with each other. As a result, your office has been officially removed as well from the office. I am discontinuing this friendship not because I hate you, but due to the fact that we do not get along and that is the main purpose. Unfortunately, my soul tells me that it's over and it's time to move on. Therefore, I wish you the best later on in life. Thank you, and until next time. Bye for now.

its hard to remember who who


[31-Mar-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
Ok so


[31-Mar-20 02:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey proof


[31-Mar-20 02:41 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
The allies they attack is mainly a voting process


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] xAfroTrey#9464
groups*


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
take pics of roles


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
idk this mr is telling me


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
mrs or lrs? @stacey


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
LRs


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
he is targetting LR staff accs with no 2-step or whatever


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
we need to make an announcement to all staff


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] xM_inn#2821
why would he attack lr staff accounts


[31-Mar-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
to put all protection


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
well he is


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
well


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
i feel like bringing attention to him


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
ye u gotta have protection


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
at all


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
staff accs that are offline


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] emma;#1525
is not gonna be great


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
LRs accs that have no acc verification


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
are getting hacked


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
but im just hearing this from an MR


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
its lrs fault if they dont have 2 step tbh


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
so


[31-Mar-20 02:43 PM] xM_inn#2821
lets try and get proof first


[31-Mar-20 02:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
if theres proof and its becoming big then we can maybe make an announcement


[31-Mar-20 02:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
some of them probably don’t even know 2 step even exists


[31-Mar-20 02:44 PM] xM_inn#2821
but like emma said, we dont want to bring attention to him


[31-Mar-20 02:44 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

I turned my DMs off


[31-Mar-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
cause apparently


[31-Mar-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
just by someone sending u a link with .ht whatever


[31-Mar-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
and u dont click it


[31-Mar-20 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
they can track you


[31-Mar-20 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
just by sending u it


[31-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
uh who told you these things @stacey


[31-Mar-20 03:23 PM] Polk#1596
i will do the same if that is true, but like that sounds extreme


[31-Mar-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
Megan and Maya


[31-Mar-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
told me


[31-Mar-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
so I turned off DMs


[31-Mar-20 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
like they suggested


[31-Mar-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
@emma; do I make a security code too


[31-Mar-20 03:25 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] stacey#1000
and


[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] bman#0435
its what were warning u guys about


[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats very weird


[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] stacey#1000
their group was gonzo


[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
@High Rank Please fill out the security code thing as well, I'll resend it. Me and Minn will currently be the only ones with access to it. May have more of the investigators added later should it be a big enough issue. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuTdLScVS6EGeMlP0RU_o02lshAOgFAEdnoZlRw46ryq3Kiw/viewform?usp=sf_link

Bloxton MR Security Codes
Pick a word or phrase that you will remember in case you are hacked. We will use these codes to verify that you are in control of BOTH your discord and Roblox accounts, so you may want to make sure it is something Roblox messaging won't filter out in case we have to do it over...

[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
@Beartikal that's why were all worried about bloxton


[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525
bc we're "next"


[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] emma;#1525

[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760

[31-Mar-20 03:26 PM] Beartikal#9760

[31-Mar-20 03:27 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 03:27 PM] stacey#1000
even if u dont click it


[31-Mar-20 03:27 PM] katie#0200

[31-Mar-20 03:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
and also y'all should consider ranking the hilton hotels ALT who is vice chairman to GM temporarily or something


[31-Mar-20 03:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
in case they attempt to access that account


[31-Mar-20 03:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
and none of us can do anything in that case


[31-Mar-20 03:29 PM] stacey#1000
take away our permissions to exile people too


[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
in case one of our accounts get hacked


[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
damn ok


[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821

[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
just temporary


[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] Beartikal#9760
k


[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
not really necessary to remove exiling permissions


[31-Mar-20 03:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

@High Rank since we're closing our dms, we need to keep a good eye on tickets instead for answering questions/concerns


[31-Mar-20 03:47 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[31-Mar-20 04:04 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn do you want to tag MRs advising they close their DMs and send friend requests to HRs/other MRs? I've tagged them 3 times already lol I feel like they need someone else


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] xM_inn#2821
sure


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
boba went on discord lockdown


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
can we do the same

[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
.


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
what sort of lockdown


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
like when


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
people try to join


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
they cant


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] emma;#1525
i'd be more than okay with not allowing new people to get talkative rn


[31-Mar-20 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
so like new members on alts cant join


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
so like


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
they dont have invites


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
right now


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
essentially


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
can we do that


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
oh so people can't even get into the server


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
yeah i like that idea


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
@Hilton Founder are you guys willing to consider shutting down invites to our discord server for the time being?


[31-Mar-20 04:06 PM] emma;#1525
so that new people (aka potentially hackers on alts) can't gain access


[31-Mar-20 04:07 PM] stacey#1000
Boba, one of our allies has done it in their discord and I really like the idea.


[31-Mar-20 04:08 PM] a. ღ#4222
Really good idea


[31-Mar-20 04:08 PM] bman#0435
thats y i wanted talkative to be temporarily suspended


[31-Mar-20 04:08 PM] bman#0435
because half the people i just reviewed were made today


[31-Mar-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
Just close invites.


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] ¢. ღ#0666
ya this is def neat https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/597449934307983370/694654187069505637/image0.png?width=440&height=604

[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
So how does that work


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
Would we have to change our vanity url to something random


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
and take it off rules and info


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
and then delete all invites


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] emma;#1525
and take invite perms away?


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
aw man


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Cam#5887
that would be yeah


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Cam#5887
or


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yo I legit just got 2 new FR


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] Cam#5887
you can still allow invites, but users arent allowed to talk


[31-Mar-20 04:09 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
on DC


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
in 2 seconds


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525
well i think we just dont want anyone joining


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] emma;#1525
at all


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] Cam#5887
which is smart


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] Cam#5887
so thats the only way


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] Cam#5887
is to delete invites


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] Cam#5887
and to take away the vanity URL


[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 04:10 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 04:29 PM] a. ღ#4222
omg fucking great my roblox wont respond


[31-Mar-20 04:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
If we lockdown the server


[31-Mar-20 04:29 PM] emma;#1525
@Cooqkie the form I tagged you in


[31-Mar-20 04:29 PM] katie#0200
close the borders so no one can get in!! 😤


[31-Mar-20 04:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
People are gonna get very concerned very quickly


[31-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Cooqkie#2809
K


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Now if we do get raided


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
They can only get to #verification


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
I’d rather they be concerned then us get raided


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
So if that happens


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
Then we could lockdown


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn they can bypass two step


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
You don’t think they can bypass verification


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
Lol


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
hmmmm


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
no


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
We either need to shut down or suspend talkative role


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] xM_inn#2821
i mean the verification channel


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
I know


[31-Mar-20 04:30 PM] emma;#1525
What I mean is clearly they know how to hack


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
I feel like something as trivial as the rover bot won’t stop them


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
But idk much about hacking


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
So

[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
Whatever you want


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
Just remember it


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
O


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] bman#0435

[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
So just


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] bman#0435
WOOOOOOOOOO


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
A random word


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
Or phrase


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Ok


[31-Mar-20 04:31 PM] emma;#1525
So if you get hacked we’ll know if you’re you or not


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
so what's the plan to not spook lrs?


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435
do yall think tomorrow is a bad day to promote bex


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] a. ღ#4222
yes


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
let them be somewhat spooked


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
Yes Bman


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435
ugh i wanted to do it april 1st


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
Let’s not promote in the middle of a crisis lol


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435
k


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
I mean there's no significant activity with the discord server yet


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435
can i get an extension


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
Are we sure we want to lock it down straight away?


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
I d it


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] Cooqkie#2809
Did it


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435
i cleared all the tickets


[31-Mar-20 04:32 PM] emma;#1525
@xM_inn Is it better to be proactive


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
Or reactive


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] katie#0200
Bman u better invite me to the promo


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
I think proactive


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] bman#0435
damn i forgot to log brb


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
I’d rather prevent a problem than clean it up


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] bman#0435
@katie ONLY IF WE DRESS UP AS SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] katie#0200
OKAY


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
We don’t have to totally shut down if that seems extreme


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
But we can stop giving out the talkative role


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
Alright let's start with suspending talkative role requests


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] Cooqkie#2809
What promo


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
And go from there


[31-Mar-20 04:33 PM] emma;#1525
And if it turns out they can bypass verification and all that then we can reconvene


[31-Mar-20 04:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
No public announcement is necessary either


[31-Mar-20 04:34 PM] Cooqkie#2809
@xM_inn what about nitro booster roles


[31-Mar-20 04:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Just put it in #access-pending


[31-Mar-20 04:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
That the roles are suspended


[31-Mar-20 04:34 PM] a. ღ#4222

[31-Mar-20 06:02 PM] xAfroTrey#9464

[31-Mar-20 06:03 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Mar-20 06:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
