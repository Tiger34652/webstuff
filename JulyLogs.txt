@Tattoblue lol mirk told me ab that and he said u heard quwanterz being disrespectful to him


[01-Jul-20 08:19 AM] stacey#1000
Yep I‚Äôm going to vote for him for inactive senior. You guys should too bearvish has been inactive forever


[01-Jul-20 08:21 AM] stacey#1000
Added NightsGems to inactive managers as well


[01-Jul-20 08:21 AM] stacey#1000
When you all get a chance please go vote on  the new inactive users added


[01-Jul-20 08:27 AM] anna#0004
@stacey nights attended training today


[01-Jul-20 08:28 AM] stacey#1000
Does he go to seniors servers


[01-Jul-20 08:28 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I searched his name on the trello


[01-Jul-20 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
And not seen anything for seniors servers so that might be why


[01-Jul-20 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
He still doesn‚Äôt really do a lot tbh


[01-Jul-20 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll keep an eye out more for now I‚Äôm keeping the notice


[01-Jul-20 08:30 AM] stacey#1000
@anna


[01-Jul-20 08:31 AM] anna#0004
Oh yes he was in jxllybeqns server at ethan's 12:15 session, but thats all i know of at the moment


[01-Jul-20 08:31 AM] stacey#1000
If he does only 1-2 sessions a month that‚Äôs not active


[01-Jul-20 08:32 AM] stacey#1000
Darren did 1 thing a week to keep his rank doing the bare minimum so he could resign when he wanted but since he didn‚Äôt really do anything he was put on inactive notice


[01-Jul-20 08:33 AM] anna#0004
mhm, not sure if nights is starting to become active again or just did the odd session, but yeah he should still be in inactive notice anyway since he doesnt do much


[01-Jul-20 08:33 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll keep an eye out more but like really I never see him so please comment on his card if you have his activity just worries me considering I see him on his alt account way more than his main


[01-Jul-20 08:33 AM] stacey#1000
He has an alt account that works at Stapleton


[01-Jul-20 08:33 AM] stacey#1000
And he is on that majority of the time


[01-Jul-20 08:33 AM] stacey#1000
Also I‚Äôve been in a vc with him when we were on Stapleton right


[01-Jul-20 08:34 AM] stacey#1000
And he legit said he has priority to Stapleton rn and so I told him to make a notice for Bloxton and he never did. He basically told me he was losing interest and that Stapleton was his main group now


[01-Jul-20 08:34 AM] anna#0004
oh right, yeah ill see if he is starting to attend more, i think he only went because nicole needed a manager and asked him though so


[01-Jul-20 08:34 AM] anna#0004
Oh right


[01-Jul-20 08:35 AM] anna#0004
Yeah it's probably best he's put under inactive managers then, i dont think hes becoming fully active atm


[01-Jul-20 08:36 AM] stacey#1000
Idk it just makes me frustrated that he does Stapleton for hours a day and can‚Äôt even bother to put a notice up for Bloxton. The same thing happened with slee. I messaged him an inactive letter then he became active again


[01-Jul-20 08:36 AM] stacey#1000
So nights needs the same thing.


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] stacey#1000
I plead my case, vote Night for inactive managers today!!


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] anna#0004
when did you suggest putting an inactive notice up?


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] stacey#1000
like


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] stacey#1000
A month ago


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] anna#0004
Yeah ima vote


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] anna#0004
Oh wow


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] stacey#1000
He never did and I‚Äôm not telling him again so :)))


[01-Jul-20 08:37 AM] anna#0004
ok his problem, he was remindedd


[01-Jul-20 08:38 AM] stacey#1000
Yep


[01-Jul-20 08:38 AM] stacey#1000
And bearvish now too


[01-Jul-20 08:39 AM] stacey#1000
Makes a new inactive notice for the 6-7th month in a row


[01-Jul-20 08:39 AM] stacey#1000
Now he gets inactive vote :))


[01-Jul-20 08:39 AM] stacey#1000
He hasn‚Äôt really updated us


[01-Jul-20 08:40 AM] anna#0004
Yeah bearvish is literally so inactive, he came on discord the other day and still had the same status as like 3 months ago


[01-Jul-20 08:41 AM] anna#0004
ill vote on his too


[01-Jul-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[01-Jul-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs on discord but never does anything


[01-Jul-20 08:47 AM] anna#0004
Yeah


[01-Jul-20 08:47 AM] anna#0004
rip


[01-Jul-20 09:07 AM] ethan;#0003
His inactive notice ended yesterday


[01-Jul-20 09:07 AM] ethan;#0003

[01-Jul-20 09:44 AM] Polk#1596

[01-Jul-20 09:44 AM] ethan;#0003
Ik


[01-Jul-20 09:44 AM] Polk#1596
i assume they are criminals since they're working on alts


[01-Jul-20 09:45 AM] ethan;#0003
I think night got expunged on his main


[01-Jul-20 09:45 AM] ethan;#0003
So he is good either way


[01-Jul-20 09:45 AM] Polk#1596

[02-Jul-20 03:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
if you look down through the audits, i think it's gave that user access to all the server channels, including classified ones so I'm just checking it's all good


[02-Jul-20 03:23 AM] babymariobebe#7563
oh

it goes through all the channels and denies perms for a certain person


[02-Jul-20 03:24 AM] xM_inn#2821

im proud i've nearly cleared 50 appeals


[02-Jul-20 03:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
i havent done appeals for MONTHS


[02-Jul-20 03:56 AM] stacey#1000
Not since I‚Äôve been an HR at least


[02-Jul-20 03:56 AM] stacey#1000

Let me see the last time you did it


[02-Jul-20 03:58 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn what if I told you it‚Äôs been over a year since you‚Äôve done appeals


[02-Jul-20 03:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
i'd be shocked


[02-Jul-20 03:58 AM] stacey#1000

It‚Äôs been over a year LOL


[02-Jul-20 03:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
i still uploaded some that people sent me personally to the HR board


[02-Jul-20 03:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
but the ban appeals channel i never rlly use


[02-Jul-20 03:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
omg...


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] stacey#1000
Yes this is why I think a board with ban appeals being sent in would be more efficient


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] stacey#1000
Like if people go to the hotel and send in a ban appeal from there


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] babymariobebe#7563
How to spot a suspicious group: they have a group holder.
They usually do this because they do strange stuff on their main account like sell robux or something and they can still keep the group if they get banned loll


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
mhm, u should bring that up at the next press conference stacey


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] xM_inn#2821
i fully agree, our current appeals system is kinda messy


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] stacey#1000
I think I did already


[02-Jul-20 03:59 AM] babymariobebe#7563
true appeals rarely happen


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] babymariobebe#7563
and the process is kinda random


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] stacey#1000
I also think people get annoyed they have to track down a manager+ to send in a appeal


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
yea


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] babymariobebe#7563
ya


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
and we put every single appeal in one list as well


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
where as it'd be easier to store them in separate lists


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] xM_inn#2821
(ic, hotel, tc, blacklist, discord ban)


[02-Jul-20 04:00 AM] stacey#1000
Like if they can go to the hotel and send it there like how bear explained the new app system for the hotel that could work for ban appeals too


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] xM_inn#2821
oh yeah i forgot about that


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] xM_inn#2821
the bloxton hub thing


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] xM_inn#2821
applications, appeals, etc


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] xM_inn#2821
i really liked that


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] stacey#1000
They can possibly even check their ban status. Like if it‚Äôs pending or declined ban appeal


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[02-Jul-20 04:01 AM] stacey#1000
Me too


[02-Jul-20 04:03 AM] xM_inn#2821
honestly though, all these people appealing, it'd just be easier if they didn't get themselves banned in the first place smh!


[02-Jul-20 04:05 AM] stacey#1000
yep but sadly there will always be people that get banned


[02-Jul-20 04:05 AM] xM_inn#2821

Can't do anything about that if there is no actual proof of them bypassing

Spamming a greeting in training shouldn't be Bannable lol


[02-Jul-20 05:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe like a suspension or fire


[02-Jul-20 05:04 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jul-20 05:32 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jul-20 05:32 PM] ethan;#0003

[02-Jul-20 05:43 PM] Polk#1596

[02-Jul-20 11:22 PM] impact#0297
can I work as a housekeeper


[02-Jul-20 11:22 PM] impact#0297

[02-Jul-20 11:22 PM] impact#0297
this is how I responded

what are they not getting


[02-Jul-20 11:24 PM] impact#0297
I think they just wanna annoy me or start a conversation with me I swear to god


[02-Jul-20 11:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Cyto that includes all staff ranks right, I‚Äôve had some questions about it


[02-Jul-20 11:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So security can be house too correct?


[02-Jul-20 11:24 PM] impact#0297
Yes.. only when there is a lack of house


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Honestly


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
We just just have a staff rank


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] impact#0297
Shhhhhh


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] impact#0297
That's too much change


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] impact#0297
Fucker!


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Lol


[02-Jul-20 11:25 PM] impact#0297
Yup, we'll have to work on that.


[02-Jul-20 11:26 PM] impact#0297
But I think we want to start empowering Seniors ASAP


[02-Jul-20 11:26 PM] impact#0297
Once that happens, we can focus on some big issues next


[02-Jul-20 11:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Can‚Äôt wait to see the proposal on that


[02-Jul-20 11:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôll be interesting to get some more help


[02-Jul-20 11:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
The next thing we should ban: DAILY PINGS ON THE DISCORD lmaooo


[02-Jul-20 11:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I get added to a new one every day


[02-Jul-20 11:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I‚Äôm jking


[02-Jul-20 11:27 PM] impact#0297
I'm discussing with Bear on giving Senior's server banning power


[02-Jul-20 11:27 PM] impact#0297
The HR's have already approved the idea.


[02-Jul-20 11:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yeah I mean it‚Äôs something that we should use more often


[02-Jul-20 11:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôll solve our CB problem


[02-Jul-20 11:28 PM] impact#0297
Bingo.


[02-Jul-20 11:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And rejoiners


[02-Jul-20 11:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That should be tested soon, would love to see how it‚Äôll work


[02-Jul-20 11:30 PM] impact#0297
I just want to give them the fucking powers


[02-Jul-20 11:30 PM] impact#0297
Their doesn't need to be an appeal process because it's a server ban.. just join another server..


[02-Jul-20 11:30 PM] impact#0297
So simple.


[02-Jul-20 11:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Indeed


[02-Jul-20 11:31 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
and what‚Äôs the hold up


[02-Jul-20 11:31 PM] impact#0297
The admin system doesn't support it.


[02-Jul-20 11:31 PM] impact#0297
If we allow banning, we give them the same "role" as high ranks.


[02-Jul-20 11:32 PM] impact#0297
That's why Bear has been exploring making his own admin these past couple days


[02-Jul-20 11:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Right makes sense since they have only mod. I‚Äôve heard about him planning on a new admin system that‚Äôs awesome


[02-Jul-20 11:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It was mentioned but never really got any details


[02-Jul-20 11:34 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Unless im behind lol


[02-Jul-20 11:34 PM] impact#0297
Really behind.


[02-Jul-20 11:34 PM] impact#0297
Attend the July 11th meeting.


[02-Jul-20 11:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[03-Jul-20 12:16 AM] impact#0297

[03-Jul-20 12:31 PM] stacey#1000
Because yes that‚Äôs concerning he‚Äôs good friends with a cb but if he never leaked or anything we can‚Äôt do much

[03-Jul-20 12:32 PM] courtney#5125
i was gonna mention that too, but that was over a month ago. theres a good chance he couldve left already @anna


[03-Jul-20 12:32 PM] anna#0004
yeah true, but lyoo may also be in that gc


[03-Jul-20 12:32 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs concerning


[03-Jul-20 12:32 PM] stacey#1000
But again if they are not leaking or anything we can‚Äôt do anything


[03-Jul-20 12:33 PM] courtney#5125
yeah.. i mean clearly alkqline has dmed rack quite a bit too

[03-Jul-20 12:34 PM] courtney#5125
i dont think he'd leak either, but it's a little off-putting that hes good friends with someone who doesnt like our game, is a cb, is banned, and continues to troll and make  accounts


[03-Jul-20 12:34 PM] bman#0435
did toku even tell the host rack was there lol

Guys that was probably one of the fastest investigations I‚Äôve done


[03-Jul-20 01:20 PM] xM_inn#2821
something like this:


[03-Jul-20 01:20 PM] xM_inn#2821

[03-Jul-20 01:22 PM] xM_inn#2821

[03-Jul-20 01:22 PM] stacey#1000
Lowkey kinda worried straw would choose to dox me too when I send him the notice as revenge. I‚Äôve never talked to him before


[03-Jul-20 01:22 PM] xM_inn#2821
im disappointed in daisy tho

[03-Jul-20 01:25 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Jul-20 01:25 PM] xM_inn#2821
then we'll sort out who's sending the notice thingy


[03-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
But I‚Äôm at least proud of myself for getting this investigation done fast. Fastest one I‚Äôve ever done


[03-Jul-20 01:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
We should do bubble bubble gum in a dish and see who‚Äôs left to send it


[03-Jul-20 01:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
Now we get to ban him from everything


[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
Discord first


[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
also even if we remove him nobody will notice


[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah we don‚Äôt have to message him right


[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] stacey#1000
Like we don‚Äôt have to send him a letter saying his role was taken right


[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] Beartikal#9760
if he comes to us, then you can tell him


[03-Jul-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
i doubt he'll even notice himself, he'll probs only realize if he isnt in the bloxton discord


[03-Jul-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
I feel like he would try to dox whoever does so


[03-Jul-20 02:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok then have cyto go to him so even u can be safe lmao


[03-Jul-20 02:13 PM] stacey#1000
He doxed venti entire hr team pretty much


[03-Jul-20 02:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
its funny how strxw was very much against doxing as an HR and fired ppl for it.. how the tables turned


[03-Jul-20 02:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
how does he doxx without info he has to start with at least **some** info right


[03-Jul-20 02:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
what info does he start with


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000

[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
No one told him the personal information


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
He just found out


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what doxing is


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] stacey#1000
Finding people‚Äôs information without their consent


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
with a start tho


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] Beartikal#9760

[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
age


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
and state


[03-Jul-20 02:14 PM] Beartikal#9760
that can be enough


[03-Jul-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
he probably started with their state


[03-Jul-20 02:15 PM] Beartikal#9760
i tried doxxing myself i couldnt find it


[03-Jul-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
cause ik people tend to reveal their state depending on their preference


[03-Jul-20 02:15 PM] xM_inn#2821
but idk, strxw be full-on stalking :flushed_cool:

[03-Jul-20 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn can you just comment on it that if Strxw asks why he is banned not to send him the evidence and not to inform him it came from Venti because Yoshi is really worried and I gave him my word it would remain confidential. He wasn‚Äôt suppose to send me the evidence. Just put if he asks only to say he was banned for doxing users in the past and more currently as well and that‚Äôs all


[03-Jul-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jul-20 03:01 PM] bman#0435

min exiled him


[03-Jul-20 03:03 PM] Tattoblue#5828
no one's gonna message him, but if he asks why then we'll tell him that he was banned for doxxing @bman


[03-Jul-20 03:14 PM] bman#0435
OHHHH exiled


[03-Jul-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah no I didn‚Äôt want to message him lol


[03-Jul-20 03:19 PM] stacey#1000
Too worried he‚Äôd dox me too for revenge :)))


[03-Jul-20 03:20 PM] bman#0435
throwback to when strxw warned me for doxxing when all i did was say someones first name that was their discord tag ü•∞üòçü•∞ü•∞üòçü•∞

Guys if you get friend request from a guy named Joshi or from anyone with a pfp of a weird dog don‚Äôt accept it. They sent me one and I declined it real fast. They try getting you to participate in their ‚Äúgame‚Äù trying to convince people to harm themselves or kill them selves. Yeah I don‚Äôt need people telling me that I declined real fast.


[03-Jul-20 03:59 PM] katie#0200

They call it the ‚Äúblue whale‚Äù challenge and they convince people to try hurting themselves and threaten them


[03-Jul-20 04:00 PM] stacey#1000

i hate it when people go to new HRs and use that as an advantage


[03-Jul-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
but yeah, tell her that her appeal is on hold and you can do a HR vote whether or not we should re-hire her


[03-Jul-20 04:05 PM] Polk#1596
i mean let her appeal


[03-Jul-20 04:05 PM] bman#0435

Her fault for making her pfp those pfps people have for the stupid blue whale challenge. I want no part of that


[03-Jul-20 04:23 PM] Polk#1596
last time when we declined her appeal


[03-Jul-20 04:23 PM] Polk#1596
emma said something and i thought she was serious so i sent it to her


[03-Jul-20 04:23 PM] Polk#1596
and it has been awkward ever since


[03-Jul-20 04:24 PM] Polk#1596
but either way, no one wants her back


[03-Jul-20 04:24 PM] stacey#1000

People are doing it again


[03-Jul-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
But we shouldn‚Äôt announce it


[03-Jul-20 04:26 PM] Beartikal#9760

[03-Jul-20 04:26 PM] stacey#1000

Then they ask you to play their game and if you refuse they somehow find personal info about you and threaten you with it if you don‚Äôt participate in it


[03-Jul-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jul-20 05:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
considering the ui design is inconsistent its probably a bunch of free models


[03-Jul-20 05:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
no doubt lol


[03-Jul-20 05:07 PM] bman#0435

[03-Jul-20 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
it can bypass pass and 2-step using the method he used on u


[03-Jul-20 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
sometimes they do "i need a sound" approach instead of clothing thing


[03-Jul-20 05:51 PM] Beartikal#9760
same diff


[03-Jul-20 05:53 PM] impact#0297

He said "oh I'm making GFX"


[03-Jul-20 05:53 PM] Beartikal#9760

[03-Jul-20 05:53 PM] ethan;#0003
You clicked a link and it sent him a download link with all your cookies in it


[03-Jul-20 05:54 PM] impact#0297
No, it was YT.


[03-Jul-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
that is how the venti owner got hacked


[03-Jul-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[03-Jul-20 05:54 PM] Beartikal#9760
no he used a youtube video which demonstrated how to "get gfx"


[03-Jul-20 05:54 PM] ethan;#0003
someone tried to do that to bman and me a few weeks ago


[03-Jul-20 05:54 PM] bman#0435
i sent a minecraft skin and said to make me a minecraft gfx üëÅüëÑüëÅ

[03-Jul-20 05:55 PM] ethan;#0003

[03-Jul-20 05:55 PM] impact#0297
@bman are you SURE I will get my shit back


[03-Jul-20 05:55 PM] ethan;#0003
if you send proof that you where compromised


[03-Jul-20 05:55 PM] ethan;#0003
they will rollback  your account


[03-Jul-20 05:55 PM] Beartikal#9760
each roblox account comes with a 1 time rollback, if you havent used it before you get the robux back


[03-Jul-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
how to hell am I suppose to show proof


[03-Jul-20 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003

[03-Jul-20 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003
and then roblox goes in and sees the log in location


[03-Jul-20 05:56 PM] impact#0297
word baby


[03-Jul-20 05:56 PM] ethan;#0003

[03-Jul-20 05:57 PM] ethan;#0003

[03-Jul-20 06:00 PM] impact#0297
I doubt it though


[03-Jul-20 06:00 PM] ethan;#0003
idk if they had rollback in 2013


[03-Jul-20 06:01 PM] impact#0297

[03-Jul-20 06:01 PM] impact#0297

[03-Jul-20 06:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
limiteds are trickier


[03-Jul-20 06:01 PM] Beartikal#9760
as each comes with a serial


[03-Jul-20 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
only limiteds that are restored are the ones with cereal numbers


[03-Jul-20 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
the ones without dont get restored


[03-Jul-20 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
those hackers sell those items for cash


[03-Jul-20 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
on like rbx place


[03-Jul-20 06:02 PM] ethan;#0003
they try to get rid of them asap


[03-Jul-20 06:03 PM] ethan;#0003
because they know they will get rolled back


[03-Jul-20 06:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
im not like a top-top dev but the some high devs have contact with DevRel and Admins a lot of the time for security and stuff which is super cool


[03-Jul-20 06:03 PM] impact#0297
well fuck me


[03-Jul-20 06:03 PM] impact#0297
there goes half of my limiteds


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
why did u paste the js code if u didnt know what it did tho


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
pasting random code is big bad


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] impact#0297
good question


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] ethan;#0003
he doesnt need to


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] ethan;#0003
if you click the link


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
he watched a video ethan


[03-Jul-20 06:04 PM] ethan;#0003
it downloads the cookies into a file


[03-Jul-20 06:05 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[03-Jul-20 06:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
the video told him about pasting it


[03-Jul-20 06:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
so he did it himself

[03-Jul-20 06:09 PM] ethan;#0003
there is no promotion card on any board for him


[03-Jul-20 06:10 PM] katie#0200
i guess that wouldve been after his inactivity letter thingy


[03-Jul-20 06:10 PM] Tattoblue#5828
if he joined in 2016 then maybe whoever promtoed him didnt add a promotion card


[03-Jul-20 06:10 PM] ethan;#0003

[04-Jul-20 01:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
i fell asleep last night before i made one


[04-Jul-20 01:25 AM] stacey#1000
no


[04-Jul-20 01:26 AM] stacey#1000
I thought you made one so I didn‚Äôt make one


[04-Jul-20 01:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
kk i'll make one


[04-Jul-20 01:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
hes been banned from everywhere right


[04-Jul-20 01:28 AM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey https://trello.com/c/cx2VuLp5/1150-strxwberry-64316854


[04-Jul-20 01:29 AM] stacey#1000
Pretty sure he‚Äôs banned from the discord but if no blacklist card was made then he wouldn‚Äôt be banned from the hotel or anything yet


[04-Jul-20 01:29 AM] stacey#1000
I didn‚Äôt ban him from anything but I think you said you banned him from the discord


[04-Jul-20 01:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
nah i only kicked him from the group. I've banned him from the hotel IC and TC, i'll ban from discord now


[04-Jul-20 01:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
if u could just add proof to the blacklist card for me then we're good


[04-Jul-20 01:31 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôll see if mobile works for me rn


[04-Jul-20 01:33 AM] ethan;#0003
I used to have a friend who was obsessed with searching up people‚Äôs names on people searcher websites to find out their personal info. Strxw probably has the same obsession


[04-Jul-20 01:36 AM] stacey#1000
Ok added everything to it

We can‚Äôt do anything tbh


[04-Jul-20 01:44 AM] stacey#1000
Most times when people do that they are asking for attention


[04-Jul-20 01:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
she could be doing that as a way to get reranked


[04-Jul-20 01:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
:/


[04-Jul-20 01:44 AM] xM_inn#2821
i hope she isnt being serious though


[04-Jul-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
She could be trying to guilt trip us


[04-Jul-20 01:45 AM] xM_inn#2821
yea


[04-Jul-20 01:45 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve seen this too many times people do this asking for attention.


[04-Jul-20 01:46 AM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôm not falling for it. I hope it‚Äôs not true but yeah I‚Äôm not falling for this one.


[04-Jul-20 01:46 AM] stacey#1000
We can‚Äôt do anything anyways


[04-Jul-20 01:47 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Yup


[04-Jul-20 01:49 AM] ethan;#0003
So many Mrs who where fired have said that before


[04-Jul-20 01:49 AM] ethan;#0003
Like GuestTbh said he killed him self


[04-Jul-20 01:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
wait


[04-Jul-20 01:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
was she just promoted


[04-Jul-20 01:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
or


[04-Jul-20 01:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
is she fired


[04-Jul-20 01:50 AM] Beartikal#9760
-


[04-Jul-20 01:51 AM] stacey#1000
She was fired within like 3 hours of being promoted because it was an alt acc of a blacklisted user


[04-Jul-20 01:52 AM] stacey#1000
So a CB basically


[04-Jul-20 01:52 AM] Beartikal#9760
so shes threatening to do that for it?


[04-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Beartikal#9760
i mean like


[04-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Beartikal#9760
its a virtual group


[04-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Beartikal#9760
with a virtual rank


[04-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Beartikal#9760
isnt that a bit dramatic


[04-Jul-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
This her way of trying to guilt trip us and ask for attention


[04-Jul-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs been done many times and never works


[04-Jul-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
An mr was fired for it too in the past


[04-Jul-20 01:54 AM] stacey#1000
You don‚Äôt joke around about that stuff


[04-Jul-20 02:22 AM] Tattoblue#5828

But all you can tell him is he was blacklisted for doxing users in the past and is currently as well. We can‚Äôt tell him it‚Äôs from venti or anything.

@Tattoblue first offence we decided on was a warning


[04-Jul-20 01:32 PM] stacey#1000
So warn him


[04-Jul-20 01:32 PM] stacey#1000
And if he does it again suspended


[04-Jul-20 01:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
No


[04-Jul-20 01:32 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs a slur


[04-Jul-20 01:32 PM] stacey#1000
Or vote


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
Add a vote


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs a termination


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
Still have to add a vote


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] bman#0435
termination-


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
we cant terminate dark for that


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] bman#0435
woah thats a bit too harsh


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] bman#0435
lol


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000

[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
termination-


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] bman#0435
probs a warning or suspension


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
I say warn him first


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
but i do agree, his behavior is not too good rn


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] bman#0435
def not something to terminate for


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] Polk#1596
he could use a lesson


[04-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
I mean he could get suspended we did announce it


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
has he ever had a past of that negative language before or is this first


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
thats true


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
id agree with a suspension


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
maybe a small one


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
idk bloo


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
i dont think so


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] Polk#1596
if he has no history whatsoever, then idk really


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] bman#0435
y is demotion an option üò¢


[04-Jul-20 01:34 PM] Polk#1596
but if you guys announced it, it's more like in the middle of a warning and suspension

[04-Jul-20 01:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
just to make sure


[04-Jul-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
I think warning is best option


[04-Jul-20 01:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
same


[04-Jul-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
And if he does it still after then suspend


[04-Jul-20 01:35 PM] bman#0435
wait which is which im confused


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
they look the same


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
LO


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
L


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
first is warning


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
2nd is suspend


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] Polk#1596
i don't think dark really meant it in a harmful way


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] Polk#1596
im sure a warning will fix it


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] bman#0435
o ok ima stick with a suspension


[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
HOPEFULLY he‚Äôs fixes it

[04-Jul-20 01:36 PM] Polk#1596
well i mean obviously it was super rude of him


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] Polk#1596
but maybe he just didnt know it was bad cuz my god MRs these days say anything


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Uh


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] Polk#1596
o_o


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Saying ‚ÄúFaggot‚Äù isn‚Äôt something that is ok


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] bman#0435
to add "idiot" in front of it is worse


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs like saying the other word towards people of color


[04-Jul-20 01:37 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs a SLUR


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Used to antagonize people


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] bman#0435
ye i see wut u mean rmaam but i think that a termination is still pretty harsh


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I disagree


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But a vote would be nice


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] Polk#1596
baby has always told us not to be too strict on punishments


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
There is a vote


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] Polk#1596
if a warning fixes it then why not do a warning


[04-Jul-20 01:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Warning isn‚Äôt enough


[04-Jul-20 01:39 PM] Polk#1596
we can always go stricter if he continues


[04-Jul-20 01:39 PM] Polk#1596
yes the vote is there


[04-Jul-20 01:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I voted


[04-Jul-20 01:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs common sense


[04-Jul-20 01:39 PM] bman#0435
btw for that "tea doc" it wont let me open it so swan is sending me the contents

[04-Jul-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs been suspended like what


[04-Jul-20 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
3-4 times now?


[04-Jul-20 02:15 PM] bman#0435

Oh


[04-Jul-20 02:16 PM] bman#0435
1 more mess up and shes gone


[04-Jul-20 02:16 PM] bman#0435
3 warnings = a suspension


[04-Jul-20 02:16 PM] bman#0435
3 suspensions = termination/demotion idk since i havent been an hr for that issue


[04-Jul-20 02:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
yup


[04-Jul-20 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[04-Jul-20 02:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It would be demotion to LR I believe

[04-Jul-20 02:58 PM] katie#0200
She‚Äôs had 3 warnings in total for the same thing but only 1 was written I think

@bman yessir?


[04-Jul-20 03:31 PM] babymariobebe#7563
They can't use that against them because roblox won't transfer their games to them, only content delete


[04-Jul-20 03:32 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Basically it's a legal scam


[04-Jul-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
hey, whats the guy on Roblox


[04-Jul-20 03:35 PM] Beartikal#9760

we dont want to alert him


[04-Jul-20 03:43 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Also why was KJ suspended


[04-Jul-20 03:47 PM] babymariobebe#7563
He accidentally leaked the board again after already being warned


[04-Jul-20 03:47 PM] babymariobebe#7563
He just slipped up and he said he will stop the screensharing


[04-Jul-20 03:48 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
O ok


[04-Jul-20 03:48 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Thanks for the heads up


[04-Jul-20 03:48 PM] bman#0435
he leaked it twice..?


[04-Jul-20 03:49 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs the right call


[04-Jul-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435
ya but it seems he did it before that...


[04-Jul-20 03:49 PM] impact#0297
I'd encourage Path to try and copyright claim in Canada.. lol


[04-Jul-20 03:49 PM] bman#0435

[04-Jul-20 03:54 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[04-Jul-20 03:54 PM] ethan;#0003
the dude spent like $250 on it


[04-Jul-20 03:54 PM] impact#0297
Yes -- Fedora will have to respond to the DCMA Claim by proving he is the rightful owner of State of Firestone


[04-Jul-20 03:54 PM] stacey#1000
Rip Stapleton


[04-Jul-20 03:54 PM] bman#0435
ripppp


[04-Jul-20 03:55 PM] impact#0297
However, since I know the ins and outs of this -- Fedora could FOIP Path asking for documents on when he made the patent.


[04-Jul-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
You should tell Fedora that


[04-Jul-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
he probaly knows


[04-Jul-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
he is like 24


[04-Jul-20 03:55 PM] impact#0297
Basically, it's a request for information and if it shows that Path made the patent before Firestone was made.. they can pass over the patent to him


[04-Jul-20 03:55 PM] impact#0297
He probably doesn't. It's government jargon


[04-Jul-20 03:56 PM] impact#0297
Bet you don't know what FOIP is until today.


[04-Jul-20 03:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
are we filing for it then?


[04-Jul-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
He is a cop irl so he might know what it is


[04-Jul-20 03:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

o nvm it change


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
he wont need to change it


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] bman#0435
oooo nice pfp


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
now obviously the guy saying "gimme ur group" is completely fake


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats a scam


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
but he CAN force him to change his group


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
@RAMMGaming so is his legal name

[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
the group name is State of Firestone the thing he copyrighted is State of Firestone Stapleton County


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] ethan;#0003
that is the name of the game


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] impact#0297
only if ROBLOX offers to change the name


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] impact#0297
Fedora could be paying royalties


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
if he comes with a DMCA roblox will comply


[04-Jul-20 03:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
100%


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ofc they are


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
they WILL NOT force him to transfer owner


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] impact#0297
ROBOX doesn't need to comply with any demands if the DMCA complaint is to Fedora


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
They don‚Äôt wanna fight it


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] impact#0297
ROBLOX does.. but they don't HAVE to.


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
roblox doesnt fight DMCAs tho


[04-Jul-20 03:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its valid, its valid


[04-Jul-20 03:59 PM] impact#0297
or ROBLOX could just delete his group lmaooo


[04-Jul-20 03:59 PM] Beartikal#9760

[04-Jul-20 03:59 PM] impact#0297
we could DMCA complaint hilton hotels and just be like "oh change it to bloxton"


[04-Jul-20 03:59 PM] impact#0297
and boom

The real subway found out and now it‚Äôs not called Subway on roblox anymore

Hey guys, can we please talk about the following users? I've recently noticed these specific former MRs giving a shady vibe in the Discord server and generally bringing toxicity to the community. Whenever there are incidents such as with the announcement a few days ago about the **STAFF** changes, they're straight in general discussion bad-naming our group etc. aside from that however, I've researched more into their actions and took some screenshots of some of the things they've said. I personally think we need to consider banning them cause the atmosphere they're bringing isn't nice. But if you wanna wait, that's also fine.

@High Rank any objection with vac hosing this game night thing on Thursday? He or someone created this game for like a rlly fun game night that they want to host on Thursday with Mrs and they want me to announce this


[04-Jul-20 08:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
@everyone

:bloxton3: **Bloxton MR Gala Event** :bloxton3:

¬†

Greetings Bloxton MRs,

¬†

I'm sure the majority of us are bored and in need of some actual fun. It's been a while since we've had a decent event only for us.

Thanks to Vacuum (vacyc) though, a good solution has been made! A formal dance and some games, as well as some ancient Hilton/Bloxton trivia games wrapped together. ¬†Introducing the Bloxton Gala, taking place in the grand and new Bloxton Ballroom, made just for us. This event will be hosted on **Thursday, July 9th** at **3PM EST/8PM BST/12 PM PST!** Here are a few things you should keep in mind if you plan on attending.

¬†

**FORMAL ATTIRE**

It's recommended to wear formal attire at this event, as this is a *formal and grand* ballroom. It's okay if you don't have anything formal, you can always just bring an outfit you like or prefer to the event.

¬†

**NO LEAKING!**

Since this is an **MR ONLY EVENT**, there should be **absolutely no LRs, or anyone that isn't authorized into the game.** This will be better protected by adding a whitelist system to the game, which only allows people who are absolutely sure they will attend. Leaking isn't good for anyone either way, don't do it!

¬†

**BALLROOM CREW MEMBERS**

Our ballroom crew members are to be respected at all times. They are responsible for keeping the place in shape and assisting in games, as well as handing out your dinner! They took time out of their day to assist and help you. If you'd like to become a ballroom staff member, contact @vacyc#2020 quickly! There's a limited amount of spots.

¬†

We hope to see you there, it'll be a blast and a moment for everyone to have some fun for a few hours! Consider yourself special.


[04-Jul-20 08:50 PM] bman#0435
thats for baby and bear, they needa make it public


[04-Jul-20 08:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
uh i guess but in future he should contact an HR and make sure its okay first before going ahead and plannning it all


[04-Jul-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
dont like how he never asked to do this tho...


[04-Jul-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
ye same as minn


[04-Jul-20 08:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
i like the thought


[04-Jul-20 08:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
and i think he means his own ballroom that he created


[04-Jul-20 08:51 PM] bman#0435
no he said the new bh ballroom


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
also isnt vac known for doing stuff behind hrs backs lmfao


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
oh if means the bloxton bloxton ballroom then thats a no


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
y does he need ballroom staff if its for fun


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
lmfao


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Thing is


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
Apparently


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
ye he means bh ballroom


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
It was Emma's idea


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
its provate tho


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
But they made it


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bman#0435
provate


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
And now she's not here


[04-Jul-20 08:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
ee


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
well if emma was still and hr i woulda been fine with it


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
So uh I don't want their effort to go to waste


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
idm us doing it, but he needs another solution than the bloxton ballroom


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
their? pretty sure it was emma and now emma wants someone to do it for her


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Hilton Founder what u think


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
and it's also an HR that should be hosting the event, not rlly vac himself


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] bman#0435
also whats the point in having ‚Äúballroom staff‚Äù if hes doing it all for fun lmao


[04-Jul-20 08:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
effort is nice but he should've consulted an HR for something so major first


[04-Jul-20 08:54 PM] bman#0435
^


[04-Jul-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
i like how he assumed he would have immediate access to the ballroom


[04-Jul-20 08:56 PM] bman#0435
lmao


[04-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oop


[04-Jul-20 08:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
i'm gonna speak to vac and see if we can arrange something on a smaller scale instead


[04-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh so he wants to use Bloxton ballroom


[04-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I thought maybe he made his own game


[04-Jul-20 08:57 PM] xM_inn#2821
same


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah he should of told someone even if it was Emma‚Äôs idea and still didn‚Äôt tell a current hr is kinda uh dumb lol


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
o wait its an MR event


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
i thought he was doing it public


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
ok that actually isnt AS bad


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
if we adjust some things


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes mr


[04-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
that's a no hosting game nights ,events ,etc should be up to the HRs. and especially since they want to use our things (Ballroom) to host it in.


[04-Jul-20 08:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
that requires preparation


[04-Jul-20 08:59 PM] Beartikal#9760
and the ballroom isnt even open

He says it's his custom ballroom


[04-Jul-20 08:59 PM] xM_inn#2821
But I still don't want him hosting it


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
you guys should be in charge of hosting events not them


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
If he will let an HR host it and work with us slowly to prepare it, I wouldn't mind personally


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
Like help where necessary


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
But I don't think he should be full-on hosting


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
He's not even a senior


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
agreed


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] Beartikal#9760
tell him that


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yea will do


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
We'll defo work around his idea tho


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
hes too immature and unprofessional for senior


[04-Jul-20 09:00 PM] bman#0435
lol


[04-Jul-20 09:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
Another reason why he shouldn't host


[04-Jul-20 09:01 PM] bman#0435
not the first thing hes done something behind our backs. wont be the last üòîüòî


[04-Jul-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
i like how he didnt even ask bonnie before making all that info, he just asked once he had everything ready to announce


[04-Jul-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
üíÄüíÄ


[04-Jul-20 09:02 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'll make it firm when I speak to him that he needs to communicate more with HRs first before going ahead and doing something so major on his own


[04-Jul-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
i thought we made it clear to him in the past


[04-Jul-20 09:02 PM] bman#0435
üòî


[04-Jul-20 09:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[04-Jul-20 09:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
Don't rlly wanna warn him or anything tho cause the effort is nice


[04-Jul-20 09:04 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I mean it‚Äôs not a bad idea, just not the brightest idea to have a manager host it


[04-Jul-20 09:06 PM] xM_inn#2821
mhm


[04-Jul-20 09:15 PM] bman#0435
especially if its vac üëÅüëÑüëÅ

[04-Jul-20 11:38 PM] ethan;#0003

[04-Jul-20 11:38 PM] Cam#5887

[04-Jul-20 11:38 PM] Cam#5887

[04-Jul-20 11:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
tsunami sushi is super old as far as technology


[04-Jul-20 11:41 PM] Beartikal#9760
like as far as programming


[04-Jul-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
true true


[04-Jul-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887
outdated scripts?


[04-Jul-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
i think they arent growing because of that


[04-Jul-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
also their building downgraded


[04-Jul-20 11:42 PM] Cam#5887

[04-Jul-20 11:42 PM] Beartikal#9760
r6 is becoming deprecated by the day


[04-Jul-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760
r6 also has a compression on hat quality


[04-Jul-20 11:43 PM] Beartikal#9760

@katie hi any updates on the connor case


[05-Jul-20 07:32 AM] katie#0200
hi no i think we may as well bring it to a conclusion @xM_inn


[05-Jul-20 07:33 AM] xM_inn#2821
ok! is he being punished or is the report just being dismissed for now


[05-Jul-20 07:34 AM] katie#0200
yeah he should be punished, we have witness statements confirming what he said, he also denied some things he said although people heard it


[05-Jul-20 07:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
what punishment do u suggest


[05-Jul-20 07:34 AM] katie#0200
id say a formal warning


[05-Jul-20 07:34 AM] katie#0200
because theres several incidents


[05-Jul-20 07:35 AM] xM_inn#2821

As of today, July 5, 2020, CookieTurtIe, rank 10 | Head Receptionist has been demoted from their position as Head Receptionist to their original LR rank due to inactivity. Bloxton HRs want to remind you that if you are inactive for a long period of time without a notice, you can be demoted.

[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Hi noob


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
someone at ints just told me they got a strike for not putting a period for the how active you will be question


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
he said "10"


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
It was good


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
How was 4th of July


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] Cam#5887
good good


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] Cam#5887
it was


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
and then he got corrected to put "10."


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] Cam#5887
loud


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] Cam#5887
too many damn fireworks


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
should people be getting a strike for not putting a period after a number


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah same too many fireworks here too


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
like someone said "10"


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Not really


[05-Jul-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
We shouldn‚Äôt be too strict


[05-Jul-20 02:34 PM] ethan;#0003
and then they got striked for not saying "10."


[05-Jul-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435
im fine with a correction but a strike is too strict


[05-Jul-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
Like yesterday at trainings someone wanted me to fail someone over a period and I said no


[05-Jul-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
And I passed them


[05-Jul-20 02:34 PM] bman#0435
someone at interviews during the grammar test said ‚ÄúBloxton hotels‚Äù and THEY GOT KICKED


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] bman#0435
so i told the mr not to be strict


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] ethan;#0003
we should let the mrs know that if they JUST put ONE number like 10 and no period they shouldn't can not be striked for that


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
Tbh we should make an announcement to MRs not to be so strict


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] bman#0435
and thateven if its a minor error they dont get kciked


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] bman#0435
thought we did


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] bman#0435
many tiems


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
No it‚Äôs been months


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
And there is a lot of new MRs now


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] bman#0435
oh


[05-Jul-20 02:35 PM] bman#0435
ye i dont mind


[05-Jul-20 02:36 PM] bman#0435
kinda gets annoying when u pm 3 mrs every session to not be strict üíÄ


[05-Jul-20 02:36 PM] courtney#5125
even some managers are being way too strict when checking at training


[05-Jul-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; if you want you can prepare an announcement for MRs to remind them not to be so strict with grammar and then send it here for thoughts and stuff


[05-Jul-20 02:36 PM] courtney#5125
idk if it was armani or ethann_n but they corrected someone for a comma üò≥


[05-Jul-20 02:36 PM] ethan;#0003
ill do it later after trainings


[05-Jul-20 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[05-Jul-20 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah tbh maybe we shouldn‚Äôt count punctuation like periods as a strike


[05-Jul-20 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
Ever


[05-Jul-20 02:37 PM] courtney#5125
agreed


[05-Jul-20 02:37 PM] courtney#5125
u can tell them to fix it, but it shouldnt count as a strike


[05-Jul-20 02:37 PM] bman#0435
ye no strike but corrections still needed


[05-Jul-20 02:37 PM] courtney#5125
yes


[05-Jul-20 02:38 PM] stacey#1000
@Hilton Founder thoughts on making a new rule where we don‚Äôt count punctuations as strikes at all? Like periods and commas and just remind people instead. I mean we kind of already do this but I don‚Äôt think it was ever made an official rule for MRs since they are still failing people over a period.


[05-Jul-20 02:40 PM] courtney#5125
i think teh only official rule we made abt periods was abt not failing someone for missing punctuation in warnings


[05-Jul-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
Yes I announced that


[05-Jul-20 02:40 PM] courtney#5125
yeah


[05-Jul-20 02:42 PM] courtney#5125

@High Rank hi folks

I'm still getting my ROBUX back. Thanks for asking.

Kj was suspended on July 3rd and will be returning soon (3 days for no-intent leaking) -- I'm personally not pleased with this at all.. but I figure I keep you all in the loop because some of you have asked. 

If any members within the group ask about this situation, forward them to me.


[06-Jul-20 08:17 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jul-20 08:28 PM] bman#0435
she wanted an announcement about striking people for saying ‚Äúa MR/HR‚Äù instead of ‚Äúan MR/HR‚Äù shouldnt be done snd i was like theres no need for an announcement if it shouldnt be strict lol


[06-Jul-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
and for some reason its so hard for her to comprehend that


[06-Jul-20 08:29 PM] courtney#5125
why would we have an announcement abt that


[06-Jul-20 08:29 PM] courtney#5125
doesnt that just fall into the announcement polk made lol


[06-Jul-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jul-20 08:30 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Jul-20 08:30 PM] ethan;#0003

[06-Jul-20 08:30 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jul-20 08:30 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jul-20 08:32 PM] courtney#5125
i appreciate sam's input and her opinion, but sometimes she just gets a little too defensive on stuff, and she ultimately assumes shes right  and there should be no further discussion :/ IDK


[06-Jul-20 08:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[06-Jul-20 08:33 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jul-20 08:36 PM] bman#0435

[06-Jul-20 09:59 PM] courtney#5125

She got 5 votes


[06-Jul-20 10:00 PM] impact#0297

[06-Jul-20 10:00 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Jul-20 10:01 PM] impact#0297

[06-Jul-20 10:01 PM] stacey#1000
HRs*


[06-Jul-20 10:02 PM] bman#0435
also attempted to team up on people

[06-Jul-20 10:02 PM] courtney#5125
im fine with her arguing about every rule we make, but only if shes gonna do it respectfully and if she has a valid argument to make, and if shes prepared for backlash and disagreements. if shes gonna argue and say ok? then like no


[06-Jul-20 10:02 PM] bman#0435

gn bman


[06-Jul-20 10:03 PM] stacey#1000
Same I need to go back to bed. My stance on Saab is she‚Äôs done this in the past and this is strike 2.


[06-Jul-20 10:03 PM] courtney#5125
gnnn stacey!


[06-Jul-20 10:03 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Jul-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôm looking into this more


[06-Jul-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney Saab started this over confusion over grammar?


[06-Jul-20 10:08 PM] stacey#1000
Or what


[06-Jul-20 10:09 PM] courtney#5125
i wasnt talking in the very beginning but


[06-Jul-20 10:09 PM] courtney#5125
it sounds like it started when she went to staff lounge and told everyone to make sure theyre not striking for "a MR/HR"


[06-Jul-20 10:10 PM] courtney#5125
and she went on to say that sometimes she strikes for it and sometimes not, so bman told her she shouldnt strike it at all bc its too minor of a thing


[06-Jul-20 10:10 PM] impact#0297
Bloo if you approve Saab's suspension, candy can execute it


[06-Jul-20 10:10 PM] impact#0297
Suspension needs to be approved by Bloo.


[06-Jul-20 10:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk Saab is  very questionable. Idk how this whole thing started, believe it was over the ‚Äúa MR/HR‚Äù if it was something to strike, but the way she took it as offense when Bman approached her about it. The thing that really bugs me was how she was demanding things such as ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move this to staff lounge‚Äù or when she went to staff lounge to say something I never said. kinda annoying if you ask me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it was like she was trying to start things because then she got all the other heads in staff lounge confused and talking about it so idk my thoughts are pretty mixed, she took way to far. @impact


[06-Jul-20 10:11 PM] stacey#1000
I think this is saying we do need to announce to all MRs not to be so strike on grammar. This is what I‚Äôve pointed out a couple days ago with the whole punctuation as no strikes anymore. Because I can guarantee you there are a lot of MRs that strike for things that could be set as reminders and there is always confusion over it.


[06-Jul-20 10:11 PM] impact#0297
blah blah blah


[06-Jul-20 10:11 PM] impact#0297
yes or no


[06-Jul-20 10:11 PM] impact#0297
@Bloo_Berriez


[06-Jul-20 10:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well you asked for my thoughts. and if anything, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a suspension, majority of Hrs seem to agree so


[06-Jul-20 10:12 PM] stacey#1000
The way Saab reacted is not respectful but really this was never announced to MRs to remind them about things instead of striking them for it.


[06-Jul-20 10:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes


[06-Jul-20 10:12 PM] impact#0297
So yes to suspending Saab?


[06-Jul-20 10:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yes


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] impact#0297
@courtney Execute.


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] impact#0297
Log it too. Put all the evidence into a nice trello card


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] courtney#5125
for how long


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
Also we do need an announcement to people about grammar


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] impact#0297
@Bloo_Berriez Duration?


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] impact#0297
No


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
Not everyone just MRs


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] impact#0297
I'm going to kill off the stupid rhetoric on grammar nazi's


[06-Jul-20 10:13 PM] impact#0297
If I can't understand you -- you get a strike


[06-Jul-20 10:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôd say about 3 days is pretty reasonable


[06-Jul-20 10:14 PM] impact#0297
If I understand you, but it's not capitalized, fuck ti.


[06-Jul-20 10:14 PM] impact#0297

Greetings Saab_ii,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as 11 | Management at Bloxton Hotels as of 10:24 PM CST. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to causing unnecessary drama and disrespecting HRs. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude on Thursday, July 9th, at 10:24 PM CST, where you may then return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Best regards,

ccandvy
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

You are not being suspended for having an opinion, as yes everyone is free to have their own opinions. The main issue is you chose to be disrespectful towards HRs and also bring the conversation into staff lounge which wasn‚Äôt really needed. For example, you stated not to strike for ‚Äúi‚Äù in staff lounge, which is not what was stated at all and this escalated the issue more with confusing MRs. 

You can work with this kind of. My brain is half asleep rn so it‚Äôs not the best

[07-Jul-20 04:31 AM] stacey#1000
I can try to explain a bit but I don‚Äôt have a lot of time


[07-Jul-20 04:32 AM] stacey#1000
So basically there was a conversation happening in management lounge where Candy was reminding Saab not to be so strict on some things regarding grammar. Like how to not fail for like ‚ÄúBloxton Hotel‚Äù and forgetting the s.


[07-Jul-20 04:35 AM] stacey#1000
It was okay when the conversation was in management lounge but the way Saab responded to some of the reminders from HRs was a bit disrespectful. For example, Bloo was also pointing out in management lounge how he would sometimes remind people at his sessions to capitalize for ‚Äúi‚Äù if they forgot to. That is just something he does at his sessions it‚Äôs not an official rule to remind them to capitalize for ‚Äúi‚Äù. Saab out of nowhere decides to bring this to staff lounge when this conversation was taking place in management lounge and that‚Äôs where the main issue started


[07-Jul-20 04:35 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll send a couple photos


[07-Jul-20 04:38 AM] stacey#1000
Here you can see Saab straight up goes into staff lounge and brings the conversation there which was uncalled for and tells everyone ‚Äúdon‚Äôt strike for I anymore‚Äù saying it‚Äôs a new rule when it‚Äôs not and she confused a lot more MRs. She put words in bloos mouth and had no reason to bring the conversation and drama into staff lounge. When confronted about it from bloo she just says ‚Äúwhy wouldn‚Äôt I?‚Äù Basically

She literally told HRs to bring this to staff lounge when the conversation was in management lounge and just made the matter worse.

gabby did report her


[07-Jul-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
but there's other evidence against leah which proves she is the ALT of the blacklisted person


[07-Jul-20 08:18 AM] xM_inn#2821
so we can discipline gabby for cyber-bullying, but leah wont be reinstated

[07-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Cam#5887
oh shoot i forgot to put amira for temp promo blacklist


[07-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Cam#5887
i think


[07-Jul-20 01:10 PM] stacey#1000
I mean Saab is allowed to tell people why she as suspended somewhat. Like she got told that was why but complaining about it and also kind of leaking is not the way to go either.


[07-Jul-20 01:10 PM] stacey#1000
Saab should be promo blacklisted if she hasn‚Äôt been already


[07-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Cam#5887
o wait nvm


[07-Jul-20 01:11 PM] Cam#5887

[07-Jul-20 01:14 PM] stacey#1000

[07-Jul-20 01:14 PM] stacey#1000

[07-Jul-20 01:14 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if anything we can extend her suspension for complaining and still acting unprofessional over it


[07-Jul-20 01:15 PM] bman#0435
the mr/hr and i thingy


[07-Jul-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
I mean it‚Äôs kind of leaking but not really


[07-Jul-20 01:15 PM] bman#0435
that was only discussed in sl


[07-Jul-20 01:15 PM] bman#0435
nowhere else


[07-Jul-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn what do you think


[07-Jul-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
I think if anything we should extend Saab‚Äôs suspension for complaining about it


[07-Jul-20 01:16 PM] stacey#1000
We‚Äôve done that before. Extending for complaining about it


[07-Jul-20 01:16 PM] stacey#1000
Adding a vote


[07-Jul-20 01:17 PM] bman#0435
ye but im more concerned over the leaking


[07-Jul-20 01:17 PM] bman#0435
like the complaining is prty straught forward


[07-Jul-20 01:17 PM] bman#0435
but the leaking part is my concern


[07-Jul-20 01:18 PM] bman#0435
im not gonna vote quite yet cuz i wanna see what one of the BODs say abt the leaking portion. however, i fully agree to extending it no matter ehat


[07-Jul-20 01:19 PM] bman#0435
i just wanna make sure im not voting on an extension for something someone would get demoted/terminated for


[07-Jul-20 01:19 PM] stacey#1000
Alrighty


[07-Jul-20 01:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it wasnt even "new grammar stuff"


[07-Jul-20 01:23 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it was literally something she was being strict about even though we've said many times before not to


[07-Jul-20 01:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and made a big o deal about it


[07-Jul-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
fr


[07-Jul-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
wonder what she woulda thought abt the 5 strikes if she doesnt like not striking for ‚Äúi‚Äù


[07-Jul-20 01:24 PM] bman#0435
lmao


[07-Jul-20 01:25 PM] bman#0435
@Bloo_Berriez do u see what she said as leaking or no


[07-Jul-20 01:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah i voted


[07-Jul-20 01:25 PM] stacey#1000
I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs leaking that‚Äôs like major enough to terminate her for


[07-Jul-20 01:25 PM] stacey#1000
Best option is to extend her suspension


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
If she still chooses to complain after that then gl to her


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435
so extend and promo blacklist


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] bman#0435
or just extend


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
Extend and promo blacklist


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
Be honest she won‚Äôt win a senior vote anyways


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
Not with what she‚Äôs proving rn


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah agreed stacey


[07-Jul-20 01:26 PM] anna#0004
shes defo going to complain about extended suspension


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez permission granted to extend her suspension?


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
she wont get senior unless its another thing we wont vote for üôÇ


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
@anna lmao yikessss


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
if she does


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
then y is she an mr


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah we have 5 votes


[07-Jul-20 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs just showing she can‚Äôt handle being a senior if she can‚Äôt handle criticism and a short suspension.


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] anna#0004
she'll go to trey like "don't we just love an extended suspension üòç"


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] bman#0435
LMFAO FRRRR


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs suppose to learn from this suspension and not make it worse


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] bman#0435
shell use it for attention


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] bman#0435
i LOVE how bliss just knew y she was suspended


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] bman#0435
without even having to ask anyone


[07-Jul-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
Well she was warned for this before

[07-Jul-20 01:29 PM] Cam#5887
i just saw that in SL


[07-Jul-20 01:29 PM] stacey#1000
So this is strike 2


[07-Jul-20 01:29 PM] bman#0435
she was also blacklisted for it


[07-Jul-20 01:29 PM] bman#0435
üòçüòç


[07-Jul-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
So is the person that suspended her supposed to inform her about the extension or can anyone


[07-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000
Rn her suspension is still only 3 days and needs to be extended to 5.


[07-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000

Greetings, Saab_ii.

This is a letter to inform you your current suspension has been extended to 5 days and will now end on July 11th instead of July 9th at approximately 11:30 PM EST.  The reason for this extension is because you have been showing unprofessionalism by complaining about your suspension. We would like to remind you that you should be setting an example to others and act professional. If you have found your current suspension to be unfair it is best to discuss it with an HR and not complain to everyone regarding the issue, as it won‚Äôt solve the issue. Please remember to be setting a good example for others and if you have any questions or concerns regarding this feel free to contact any member of the HR team.

i keep experiencing major lag on the discord server, like as if time stops then every message starts flooding in after a while... mrs say the cause is the gaius bot, so could u guys investigate this or reconsider the bot? its kind aannoying having to deal with the lag @Hilton Founder


[07-Jul-20 02:37 PM] bman#0435
i also see this


[07-Jul-20 02:37 PM] bman#0435
ever since we added that bot, the server goes down for 5 minutes when i open the app then its back up


[07-Jul-20 02:37 PM] anna#0004
ya i mentioned that to bear, its whenever people get kicked the boy creates channel overrides which causes lag @Polk

That wasn‚Äôt an HR


[07-Jul-20 02:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
its in personel DMs and doesnt affect anyone


[07-Jul-20 02:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
i would be mad too


[07-Jul-20 02:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
if she complains and disrespects us thats different


[07-Jul-20 02:57 PM] Beartikal#9760
but i dont see disrespect in there


[07-Jul-20 02:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
she was not disrespectful


[07-Jul-20 02:58 PM] Beartikal#9760
so there shouldnt be an extension


[07-Jul-20 03:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
i agree with the suspension because she did go to SL and make up rules


[07-Jul-20 03:02 PM] Beartikal#9760
but i dont agree with the extension


[07-Jul-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not really setting a good example to even dm people and complain about it. She also leaked to trey a bit by saying what happened in the channels for the reason she was suspended. Not major but still kind of. The whole point of a suspension is to learn from your mistakes and not complain about it and be unprofessional. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be in the discord.  I don‚Äôt really see why she had to dm trey about it in the first place if she found it unfair she could‚Äôve DMed an hr further about it.


[07-Jul-20 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
She has every right to dm an hr about her concerns about it


[07-Jul-20 03:03 PM] bman#0435
agreed with stacey. she also decided to talk abt me to trey in that photo saying i was being snippy to her


[07-Jul-20 03:04 PM] bman#0435
when all i did was tell her she was being too strict...


[07-Jul-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
But dming other people about it and basically trash talking is not professional


[07-Jul-20 03:04 PM] stacey#1000
If she was finding it really unfair it‚Äôs best to keep the conversation between HR+ about her concerns


[07-Jul-20 03:05 PM] bman#0435
@ethan; did she call minn an ‚Äúit‚Äù lol


[07-Jul-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
trey didnt backstab anyone. he did the right thing and told me


[07-Jul-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
I mean yes I understand she‚Äôs upset but that still doesn‚Äôt mean she can basically trash talk other HRs and complain to others about it because it doesn‚Äôt set a good example and I don‚Äôt view it as professional


[07-Jul-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
tf kinda statement was that lmfao

backstabbing is when you pretend to be friendly and go to someone else


[07-Jul-20 03:06 PM] Beartikal#9760
its what he did isnt it lol


[07-Jul-20 03:06 PM] bman#0435
trey never backstabbed. he never asked abt it, she brought it up randomly. trey did the right thing to report it because he knew what she was doing aint right


[07-Jul-20 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
I mean she still basically leaked to trey and didn‚Äôt have to tell trey about it and complain


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
To him*


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
its saabs fault for even thinking its okay to do that lol


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
either way trey acted so friendly just so she could spill more details


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats what i see anyway


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
She still made the choice to do so


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
It was her actions


[07-Jul-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
because trey is friendly


[07-Jul-20 03:08 PM] bman#0435
not his fault that hes like that


[07-Jul-20 03:08 PM] Beartikal#9760
then again i dont like how she said she was suspended for saying "it was  an opnion" which is absolutely was not


[07-Jul-20 03:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
she went to SL and announced a new rule


[07-Jul-20 03:09 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats not an opinion


[07-Jul-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
ye that wasnt even what candy told her


[07-Jul-20 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
We‚Äôve had issues with Saab in the past like this


[07-Jul-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
not remotely close


[07-Jul-20 03:10 PM] stacey#1000
And she is complaining to people now saying it‚Äôs unfair instead of owning up to her actions and learning from her mistakes like she should be


[07-Jul-20 03:10 PM] stacey#1000
Main reason for the extension. She needs to accept responsibility for her actions and learn from her mistakes instead of being more unprofessional and complaining to others about it that‚Äôs not an HR.


[07-Jul-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435
even some former hrs that dont talk to saab know exactly y shes suspended lol


[07-Jul-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435
they didnt even need to ask anyone to lnow y


[07-Jul-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
ye what stacey said


[07-Jul-20 03:11 PM] bman#0435
and her borderline leak


[07-Jul-20 03:11 PM] stacey#1000
She just needs to take this time to really reflect on her actions if she still really thinks she did nothing wrong and complains to everyone about it.


[07-Jul-20 03:11 PM] stacey#1000
She wasn‚Äôt learning from her mistakes and was making it worse by DMing other people about it.


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] stacey#1000
She just needs to really learn but honestly with the way she‚Äôs acting to it rn idk if she will


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
this is exactly y none of us planned on promoting her


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
snd y she was promo blacklisted as a head


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
and now as a manager


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] stacey#1000
She won‚Äôt be nominated for a senior vote anytime.


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] stacey#1000
She is proving she can‚Äôt handle criticism to learn from her mistakes


[07-Jul-20 03:12 PM] bman#0435
unless she gets promoted with no vote üòê


[07-Jul-20 03:13 PM] stacey#1000
So that‚Äôs why it was extended


[07-Jul-20 03:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
ok


[07-Jul-20 03:13 PM] Beartikal#9760
im fine with that


[07-Jul-20 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
Oki


[07-Jul-20 04:00 PM] bman#0435
@stacey r u gonna make the promo blacklist card for saab


[07-Jul-20 04:00 PM] bman#0435
or should i


[07-Jul-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm on mobile


[07-Jul-20 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
You can if you want


[07-Jul-20 04:24 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 gl that announcement won‚Äôt last we have announced it many times and people still do it

[07-Jul-20 04:32 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jul-20 04:36 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think a suspension will help


[07-Jul-20 04:36 PM] ethan;#0003

[07-Jul-20 04:36 PM] ethan;#0003

[07-Jul-20 04:36 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] Cam#5887
she should know better


[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
3 written warnings is suspension


[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] Tattoblue#5828
If it was just a 1 time thing I would've went with a warning but she's been immature consistently and she also just got off of a suspension not too long ago so


[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
we should wait for more people to vote then


[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
if its 3 and 4


[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435
3 suspensions is demotion


[07-Jul-20 04:37 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jul-20 04:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[07-Jul-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
emily has one for it


[07-Jul-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
so y not jess


[07-Jul-20 07:32 PM] courtney#5125
emily has a verbal warning i think


[07-Jul-20 07:32 PM] bman#0435
ah right verbal


[07-Jul-20 07:32 PM] Cam#5887
ye


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] courtney#5125
yes yes


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
i hate how verbals r literally noted


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Cam#5887
but dont we need a vote tho?


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
like


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Cam#5887
cause like


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Cam#5887
its an MR


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Cam#5887

[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] bman#0435
thats the code


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] courtney#5125
i mean bc this jason derulo's song says fucks like 2-3+ times


[07-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Cam#5887
it does yes


[07-Jul-20 07:34 PM] Cam#5887
it says it i think like 4 times


[07-Jul-20 07:34 PM] Cam#5887
cause its in the verse


[07-Jul-20 07:34 PM] Cam#5887
rather than just in a chorus


[07-Jul-20 07:34 PM] courtney#5125
hmmmmm


[07-Jul-20 07:36 PM] courtney#5125
ok the song emily played said shit once


[07-Jul-20 07:37 PM] courtney#5125
if that matters, i feel like shit being said once could be easily overlooked, idk how u can overlook "dont give two fucks" when its literally in the chorus and said several times


[07-Jul-20 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
How did that audio get passed roblox in the first place


[07-Jul-20 07:43 PM] Cam#5887

[07-Jul-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000

One did that at my interviews earlier


[07-Jul-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
Kicked all on my server


[07-Jul-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
So now you just have to watch for them at sessions and ban them before giving anyone mod


[07-Jul-20 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 i fired and banned Cvxics46 i didnt know he was in the discord but he doxxed me about 4 months ago


[07-Jul-20 09:16 PM] bman#0435

[07-Jul-20 09:20 PM] ethan;#0003
and we wont notice it


[07-Jul-20 09:20 PM] bman#0435
saab after we make an announcement abt trollers and the usernames and not about "i" and "a/an" >:(


[07-Jul-20 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
No need I‚Äôm announcing to y‚Äôall and seniors. We are the ones that give mod and the ones that need to know


[07-Jul-20 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
Seniors can get admin to mod too


[07-Jul-20 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm announcing to them

wheres the proof tho


[08-Jul-20 10:28 AM] bonnie591#0591
theres 2 screenshots and a gif


[08-Jul-20 10:28 AM] bonnie591#0591

@bman


[08-Jul-20 10:29 AM] bman#0435
moody doesnt have proof of her blocking the door but the other stuff is in chatlogs attached


[08-Jul-20 10:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
thats not really enough proof


[08-Jul-20 10:30 AM] bman#0435
i dont think u would reset someone, use an h message to tell them not to block the door, reset the same person, and say the same message again


[08-Jul-20 10:30 AM] bman#0435
and that being random enough to not be evidence

u do realize how often jessie lies right


[08-Jul-20 10:31 AM] bman#0435
moody made 2 h messages to tell them to sit


[08-Jul-20 10:31 AM] bman#0435
jessie doesnt need to do moodys job for him


[08-Jul-20 10:31 AM] bman#0435
if she had sat down and let moody take care of his own server she wouldnt of had been reset anyways


[08-Jul-20 10:32 AM] bonnie591#0591
she was probably just trying to be helpful


[08-Jul-20 10:32 AM] bonnie591#0591
i dont really see how this justifies a warning. there's reasonable doubt


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bman#0435
shes an mr, she isnt exempt from rules anyways. moody asked everyone to sit down and get away from the door and she clearly didnt


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
what about omg then


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
did omg get a warning


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
moody respawned them twice two


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
or omq


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok once


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bman#0435
dont ask me, i wasnt the one who warned or reported


[08-Jul-20 10:33 AM] bonnie591#0591
but still

[08-Jul-20 10:34 AM] bonnie591#0591
wow damn 4 of you voted for a suspension eek


[08-Jul-20 10:35 AM] bonnie591#0591
i dont really see how we should warn someone when the only proof is 2 h messages to the whole server and 2 respawns


[08-Jul-20 10:45 AM] bman#0435
do you randomly just respawn someone twice and make the same message about not pushing the door each time in your sessions? ik i dont


[08-Jul-20 10:50 AM] bonnie591#0591
i dont do that either, surprisingly but proof of a senior respawning someone twice and doing a "h" twice doesnt 100% prove that she did it


[08-Jul-20 12:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well she admits she did it and refused to listen @bonnie591

[08-Jul-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
half the things she stated r lies


[08-Jul-20 04:51 PM] bman#0435
1) she was reset at trainings because she was ignoring moodys rules and wasnt sitting down


[08-Jul-20 04:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Is the mass shift still happening?


[08-Jul-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
2) no hr is ignoring her. she literally unfriended bonnie


[08-Jul-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
3) u dont randomly lose 16 friends lol not sure abt that


[08-Jul-20 04:52 PM] bman#0435
4) mitch only told like 3 people, maybe even 2 abt the suspension


[08-Jul-20 04:53 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[08-Jul-20 06:20 PM] Polk#1596
we cant really suspend someone over personal issues like that


[08-Jul-20 06:20 PM] bman#0435
shes already suspended


[08-Jul-20 06:20 PM] Polk#1596
but her behavior does really disgust me, we aint gonna promote her thats for sure


[08-Jul-20 06:20 PM] Polk#1596
yes ik


[08-Jul-20 06:20 PM] Polk#1596
no extensions!

[08-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Polk#1596
yes we cant really do much more


[08-Jul-20 06:22 PM] bman#0435
i mean i rly hate to say it but cant we stoop down towards a demotion


[08-Jul-20 06:22 PM] Polk#1596
she is just being salty about trey, let's just note her behavior and keep it as evidence for future references


[08-Jul-20 06:22 PM] bman#0435
like this would obviously of had gotten a punishment, i dont like the idea of doing nothign about it


[08-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Polk#1596
i wish but thats not worthy of a demotion


[08-Jul-20 06:23 PM] bman#0435
this is her 3rd day in a row with issues


[08-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Polk#1596
from what i understand, she is confronting trey about "backstabbing her" which is a personal issue


[08-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Polk#1596
i dont think we should step in like that, id just get trey to block her or something


[08-Jul-20 06:25 PM] bman#0435
its not really that part im rly focusing on, heres like what i see from it


[08-Jul-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
she thought what she was doing was okay because she was friends with trey. when she got her extension she then went right to trey and started to be rude to him because he did the right thing. she is dragging her suspension out to what it shouldnt even be


[08-Jul-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
shes being super immature and unprofessional of this whole situation


[08-Jul-20 06:26 PM] bman#0435
@Polk


[08-Jul-20 06:27 PM] bman#0435
i feel like at least something has to be put in place because of her actions. it wouldnt be tolerated by anyone else so why should it be tolerated by her


[08-Jul-20 06:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Can we get like a scripts that holds a limit on lr ranks


[08-Jul-20 06:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like if theres like 8 bartenders no other bartenders can join


[08-Jul-20 06:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
til one leaves


[08-Jul-20 06:30 PM] bman#0435
idk i dont think thats rly necessary, u can just ask people to leave


[08-Jul-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
I mean honestly Idk what else we can do about Saab.


[08-Jul-20 06:30 PM] bman#0435
but can we not get off the saab topic quite yet if u dont mind

idk and thats the annoying part, she cant learn from a promo blacklist


[08-Jul-20 06:41 PM] courtney#5125
righttttt ://


[08-Jul-20 06:42 PM] anna#0004

Bye bye thegamingtank you earned yourself a promo blacklist card!!!


[08-Jul-20 07:14 PM] stacey#1000
disappointing this is from a former MR


[08-Jul-20 07:14 PM] anna#0004
omg ikr candy whenever someone gets promo everyones like "say ur first promo" @courtney


[08-Jul-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
no one wanted to promote him anyways


[08-Jul-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
he was promo thirsty


[08-Jul-20 07:14 PM] bman#0435
üíÄ


[08-Jul-20 07:14 PM] stacey#1000
well now we have a better reason to not promote him :))


[08-Jul-20 07:15 PM] anna#0004
he likes to boss people around a lot bc hes former so


[08-Jul-20 07:15 PM] courtney#5125
yeah... like i dont care if they swear or not, i seriously DONT. i just dont think having 10 mrs say "SAY UR FIRST SWEAR WORD" "CURSE" "SWEAR" "SAY BLA BLA BLA" is very welcoming, kind, and honestly its quite intimidating


[08-Jul-20 07:15 PM] anna#0004
LOL yeah like ur allowed to swear there but shouldnt be encouraged


[08-Jul-20 07:16 PM] courtney#5125
right!! considering it should be kept to a respectful limit


[08-Jul-20 07:17 PM] courtney#5125
i mean if i was just promoted to mr and introduced to a bunch of new, scary channels, im definitely not looking for a huge amount of mrs asking me to swear. whether theyre morally against it or theyre totally ok with swearing, its not really considerate to be asking someone to swear like IDK how else to explain it


[08-Jul-20 07:18 PM] bman#0435
we told them cursing was frowned upon


[08-Jul-20 07:18 PM] bman#0435
lol


[08-Jul-20 07:18 PM] courtney#5125
im not saying dont swear, im saying dont force it on people. it IS forcing when u have 10+ ppl asking u to swear and pinging u. id rather be pinged for congratulating me, not begging me to say my "first curse word"


[08-Jul-20 07:20 PM] anna#0004
exactly


[08-Jul-20 07:22 PM] stacey#1000
what MRs were doing it


[08-Jul-20 07:26 PM] courtney#5125
lemme check!


[08-Jul-20 07:30 PM] courtney#5125
ok it was CircularFridge, vUn1x, moodyqz, and xxMewTimes2xx. they were pinging maddie several times asking her to swear. then why i asked why they all ask ppl to swear, mirk starts being rude abt it lol

why did he ping moody on the last screenshot


[08-Jul-20 07:33 PM] courtney#5125
its just annoying, considering its not exactly recommended to swear. its optional to do it, but its not really something you should encourage. and its DEFINITELY not something someone looks forward to seeing in staff lounge. im sure they expect a bunch of new peers and co-workers to be congratulating them and helping them, not literally telling them to swear :/


[08-Jul-20 07:33 PM] courtney#5125
bc moody kept pinging me and saying that they werent forcing ppl to swear, but its literally forcing when u have a bunch of ppl pinging SEVERAL times saying 'SWEAR' 'SAY UR FIRST SWEAR WORD' @anna


[08-Jul-20 07:34 PM] anna#0004
oh right, yeah im not sure why that even became a thing tbh

[08-Jul-20 07:42 PM] ethan;#0003
we should announce to mrs that before the host joins they should check themself and scan over the seats to see if anyone has a name thats the same as mrs


[08-Jul-20 07:42 PM] ethan;#0003
to save the host time

[08-Jul-20 08:22 PM] impact#0297
To be quite honest with you guys...


[08-Jul-20 08:22 PM] impact#0297
1) I'm not in a good mood considering I was scammed


[08-Jul-20 08:22 PM] ethan;#0003
D:


[08-Jul-20 08:23 PM] impact#0297
2) I'm with pretty high officials on Saturday, we have reason to believe that there is a second wave imminent for COVID.


[08-Jul-20 08:23 PM] impact#0297
3) Baby & Bear already know the pressing concerns.. plus they are working on a bloxton update..


[08-Jul-20 08:24 PM] impact#0297
4) I'm allowing Candy, Anna, and Cam more time for their tasks.


[08-Jul-20 08:25 PM] impact#0297
Also, I'm creating a process for suggestions at the meetings.. I've been getting good suggestions but I've also received some shitty ones. I will be creating a format that forces you to think about your suggestion before you submit it.


[08-Jul-20 08:26 PM] impact#0297
Any questions?


[08-Jul-20 08:26 PM] courtney#5125
no questions so far


[08-Jul-20 08:26 PM] anna#0004
^^


[08-Jul-20 08:27 PM] impact#0297
Also, there will be no excuse to not attend the upcoming meeting.


[08-Jul-20 08:27 PM] impact#0297
We have lots to cover -- and people who are not in attendance will be notified.


[08-Jul-20 08:27 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Polk i have a back-up of it


[08-Jul-20 08:27 PM] xM_inn#2821

[08-Jul-20 08:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
okay! should be fixed


[08-Jul-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
i have a question


[08-Jul-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
will baby and bear ever attend one of the meetings


[08-Jul-20 08:29 PM] bman#0435
or no


[08-Jul-20 08:29 PM] Polk#1596
phew!


[08-Jul-20 08:29 PM] Polk#1596
i hope that was just a fluke, or else we need to backup everything


[08-Jul-20 08:30 PM] Polk#1596
sure cyto that sounds good


[08-Jul-20 08:31 PM] impact#0297
@bman I've made it clear that Baby & Bear can attend if they want, but all the votes are recorded in my notes and I spend 30 minutes after the meeting to brief them both.


[08-Jul-20 08:32 PM] bman#0435

Unless emma removed me

o i dont think emma would do that lol


[09-Jul-20 07:47 AM] bman#0435
but i got help from stacey with the code thingy


[09-Jul-20 07:48 AM] bman#0435
cookies roblox was compromised and then like 4 minutes later he verifies himself on the discord and practically begged me for his roles back


[09-Jul-20 07:48 AM] bman#0435
then when i gave them back he sais his code was stupid


[09-Jul-20 07:48 AM] bman#0435
he was just acting sus so i wanted his code just to make sure


[09-Jul-20 07:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
mk do u still need access to it @bman


[09-Jul-20 08:05 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I think a suspension is a bit much for just saying there is an MR memory channel. She was just promoted yesterday and I did explain to her about leaking. But if she just says like ‚Äúthere is a channel named this‚Äù it‚Äôs not really a secret because everyone has seen the channel names pretty much. Like people know about a staff lounge. I think a warning is fine.


[09-Jul-20 08:05 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not like she took a screenshot of what happened she just said there was an mr memory channel. That‚Äôs not really major. That‚Äôs like me saying there is a staff lounge but  that‚Äôs it.


[09-Jul-20 08:06 AM] stacey#1000
@anna I‚Äôm letting you know too considering you voted for a suspension. It‚Äôs a bit much.


[09-Jul-20 08:07 AM] stacey#1000
Suspension is too strict I think.


[09-Jul-20 08:07 AM] anna#0004
Actually yeah that's pretty true, she only said the channel name and not the contents of it, plus she's new


[09-Jul-20 08:07 AM] anna#0004
I'd say warning too


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
Plus is there real evidence she said it. Like everyone knows the channel names. A cb could be mad she got promoted and is framing her


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] bman#0435
is there even evidence


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
Like what is this


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] bman#0435
ya what stacey said


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] bman#0435
im not voting unless i see what specifically was leaked


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn where‚Äôs the real proof she said it


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
Jsyk in the cb server they are trash talking the new promotions so it‚Äôs not a surprise there is already a report against her


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] bman#0435
@xM_inn also i personalyl dont need access to it but i think there should be a more widespread of hrs that do. all ik that have access r u katie and stacey


[09-Jul-20 08:08 AM] stacey#1000
This is what they do. Try to get people fired.


[09-Jul-20 08:09 AM] bman#0435
also how does she not know leaking was a rule-


[09-Jul-20 08:09 AM] stacey#1000
I told her


[09-Jul-20 08:09 AM] bman#0435
she said she didnt know lol

[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] bman#0435
then like i would go with warning


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] bman#0435
but if its contents


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] bman#0435
then idk


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what I sent her


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] bman#0435
cuz like everyone knows the channels


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] stacey#1000
I mean from what I see she only said the name of a channel


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] stacey#1000
Which is legit nothing


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] bman#0435
ye so id go with a warning. maybe nothing since theres not even proof


[09-Jul-20 08:11 AM] anna#0004
the channels have been leaked so many times before but if she leaked what was said in them then thats a different story but yeah if she only said the channel name, I'd go with warning


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] stacey#1000
So yeah warning. She hasn‚Äôt even been an mr for 24 hours lol


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] anna#0004
i think the bit where she said "I didn't even know it was a rule" was basically her admitting to it @bman


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] stacey#1000
All the evidence says she just said there was an MR memory channel


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs legit nothing


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] bman#0435
ye but we still need proof of the actual thing


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] bman#0435
we dont know if she went into detas or just said channel names


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] stacey#1000
Either way like it‚Äôs not really major


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] anna#0004
mhm


[09-Jul-20 08:12 AM] bman#0435
or if she was tricked into saying it or did it for fun


[09-Jul-20 08:13 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll remain on a warning. Just remember not to be too strict on people for minor things lol


[09-Jul-20 08:14 AM] stacey#1000
Like yes ofc we would suspend or fire if she sent screenshots of it or like said actual things happening in the channel


[09-Jul-20 08:14 AM] stacey#1000
But like saying ‚Äúomg there is a staff lounge!‚Äù Is nothing lmao


[09-Jul-20 08:21 AM] stacey#1000
@anna @bman @xM_inn problem resolved

And I told her not to do it again, so she was warned


[09-Jul-20 08:22 AM] anna#0004

[09-Jul-20 08:22 AM] anna#0004

[09-Jul-20 08:45 AM] stacey#1000

These are some concerns raised by jz_sy


[09-Jul-20 10:14 AM] bman#0435
bruh shes being so dramatic. she is saying all this yet hasnt sent a single screenshot of any of it actually happening. jesse reports such minor stuff too, so if she claimed mrs told her she deserved to be demoted how come she didnt report them yet? megamitch only told like 3 people too because he didnt know, but regardless it wasnt okay for him to do hence his punishment


[09-Jul-20 10:14 AM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming i assume this was to fraux?

ah ok


[09-Jul-20 10:15 AM] courtney#5125
for the part she mentions about an mr attacking her and blocking her abt skipping a song, im pretty sure that was lee. they were having a fight over that and i literally helped them work it out and she said they were good friends, so it seems like shes just bringing up past drama with some of them


[09-Jul-20 10:15 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
She feels as though it‚Äôs hard to approach the HR team


[09-Jul-20 10:15 AM] bman#0435
bruh


[09-Jul-20 10:16 AM] bman#0435
well i mean she shouldnt be lying and making claims with no evidence whatsoever


[09-Jul-20 10:16 AM] courtney#5125
ya i can literally show u our dms. she came to me saying she was upset about lee, so i asked if they could apologize and work it out, and she said they did and lee said they did too....

shes using situations that are fibbed or dragged out for attention


[09-Jul-20 10:17 AM] courtney#5125
im confused. so she says that not many ppl respond to her while theyre at a themed session......


[09-Jul-20 10:17 AM] courtney#5125
isnt that bc people are..................building..........and focused?


[09-Jul-20 10:17 AM] bman#0435
if she wants to make those claims, good for her. i wont give a crap abt any of it until i see proof and evidence of EVERYTHING she just stated. otherwise its just a waste of time and attention


[09-Jul-20 10:18 AM] courtney#5125
i think she also has to understand that not every one is going to like eachother, and not everyones going to like her. we dont all get along perfectly, so if someone doesnt really want to talk to her, then so be it.. as long as theyre not harassing or bullying her, i dont see a problem with some people not interacting with eachother outside of talking abt bloxton :/


[09-Jul-20 10:18 AM] bman#0435
she cant really expect to get attention from every single mr or to have every single mr like her. not everyone is going to like everyone else


[09-Jul-20 10:18 AM] courtney#5125
right!


[09-Jul-20 10:19 AM] bman#0435
well rmaam if she ever comes to u with evidence ill be right here to see it! c:


[09-Jul-20 10:20 AM] bman#0435
y is she also dragging her brother into this lmfao. i didnt even know she had one until she stated it


[09-Jul-20 10:22 AM] courtney#5125
LOL im confused abt the brother thing. i have no idea who that is and i cant imagine ppl would be ATTACKING him for jessie's mistakes-


[09-Jul-20 10:23 AM] courtney#5125
she has a right to be upset if she isnt feeling like shes comfortable with the mr team, but some of these things are things we just cant help her with. we cant force everyone to like her and say hi to her everytime shes talking :/


[09-Jul-20 10:23 AM] bman#0435
ya idek shes def making stuff up for attention. she hasnt even made an attempt to message me. last thing she said was a copied and pasted message to both u and me lol


[09-Jul-20 10:23 AM] courtney#5125
yaa..


[09-Jul-20 10:24 AM] bman#0435
but again, until i see evidence of any statement she made, idgaf.


[09-Jul-20 10:25 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I remember for my ratatouille themed session Kyle told her to get off this bridge he made like numerous times and she got offended, then said she cut her hand and needed to go to the hospital because she was bleeding badly and she came back like hour later fine üíÄüíÄ that‚Äôs when I noticed she overacts


[09-Jul-20 10:26 AM] bman#0435
she cut her hand-


[09-Jul-20 10:26 AM] courtney#5125
she cut her hand on purpose......?


[09-Jul-20 10:26 AM] bman#0435
like on purpose..?


[09-Jul-20 10:26 AM] courtney#5125
over a virtual bridge someone was standing on........?


[09-Jul-20 10:26 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk she just said she cut her hand, I think it was accidental but not sure


[09-Jul-20 10:27 AM] courtney#5125

[09-Jul-20 10:27 AM] courtney#5125

> ya idek shes def making stuff up for attention. she hasnt even made an attempt to message me. last thing she said was a copied and pasted message to both u and me lol
@bman  she never tries to message me about importantt things either, but she's always tagging me in staff lounge asking if she can build in my session even tho i have no more building spots üíÄ


[09-Jul-20 10:40 AM] bman#0435
didnt u say to dm u


[09-Jul-20 10:40 AM] bman#0435

[09-Jul-20 10:40 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[10-Jul-20 10:52 AM] Cam#5887
or any other MR channels


[10-Jul-20 10:53 AM] Cam#5887

[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] bman#0435
grrr


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] bman#0435
probs a new mr


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] bman#0435
@Cam put in #hr-announcements


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] Cam#5887
ok


[10-Jul-20 10:54 AM] bman#0435
also ill save the admin acts discussion for when baby and bear r online :pepedance:


[10-Jul-20 10:56 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@bman dere was a whole convo about the admin acts liek a month ag0


[10-Jul-20 10:56 AM] Tattoblue#5828
well 2 months


[10-Jul-20 10:56 AM] bman#0435
ya well it being a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù aint gonna cut it. admin acts r literally half our job


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
We already get paid for sessions, applications and tickets. Most groups don't pay their HRs, so we should be lucky.


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] bman#0435
idk but i feel like its buriedbear because of yesterdays incident


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] Cam#5887
Okay, so I have an issue with this leaking thing.


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
What happened yesterday?


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] bman#0435
he was basically encouraging that troller


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] Cam#5887
Do we think it could possibly be an MR in the CB Discord Server?


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@xM_inn ye agreed


[10-Jul-20 10:57 AM] Cam#5887
Some MRs can be quite close with the CBs.


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
Therefore, making it vulnerable.


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] bman#0435
why dont u ask bear. hes an admin in that server :)


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
Buriedbear?


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
Well, how would he know though?


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] bman#0435
nope, beartikal


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] bman#0435
hes an admin in that server


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
Hm


[10-Jul-20 10:58 AM] Cam#5887
But this leaking is probably through DMs


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] bman#0435
well they said theyre in vc


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] bman#0435
so


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Cam#5887
True


[10-Jul-20 10:59 AM] Cam#5887
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM


[10-Jul-20 12:15 PM] bman#0435

[10-Jul-20 12:43 PM] bman#0435
vac is rly close with cbs too apparently


[10-Jul-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
The cbs talk shit about him all the time and have shown they hate him so


[10-Jul-20 12:44 PM] bman#0435
is that y diego spams his dms with song lyrics and it became a "rule" in the mr "rule book" to send the same lyrics to him?


[10-Jul-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
is maddy even allowed to haev 2 accounts


[10-Jul-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
like ik shes allowed


[10-Jul-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
but she is only permitted to have 1 verified


[10-Jul-20 12:45 PM] bman#0435
idk theres something sus about that


[10-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Cam#5887

[10-Jul-20 12:50 PM] bman#0435

And the real Madi can contact us and can verify her security code too


[10-Jul-20 12:50 PM] stacey#1000
Not having that shit at all


[10-Jul-20 12:51 PM] stacey#1000
Idk why she thinks it‚Äôs ok to be verified under two accounts


[10-Jul-20 12:51 PM] bman#0435
idk y either


[10-Jul-20 12:51 PM] stacey#1000

[10-Jul-20 12:53 PM] bman#0435
and how does she know i did it


[10-Jul-20 12:54 PM] stacey#1000
Idk but you gotta tell her she was verified under two accounts in the discord


[10-Jul-20 12:54 PM] stacey#1000
Which is not allowed and suspicious


[10-Jul-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435
You are only permitted to verify under 1 account. I noticed you were verified under 2, which is not allowed.


[10-Jul-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435
sending that to her


[10-Jul-20 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
She verified again and got her roles back that‚Äôs why


[10-Jul-20 12:55 PM] bman#0435
or is there something else i should send


[10-Jul-20 12:55 PM] bman#0435
oh bruh


[10-Jul-20 12:56 PM] stacey#1000

@anna from the discord?


[10-Jul-20 12:57 PM] anna#0004
Uh no I think he means the TC because he showed me a screenshot of them at tc and asked why theyre not banned and only fired

Should we just temporally suspend everyone that has 2 accounts


[10-Jul-20 01:02 PM] anna#0004

[10-Jul-20 01:02 PM] katie#0200

[10-Jul-20 01:11 PM] katie#0200
lol bruh that is not a reason to have two accounts verified in the disc.. she only needs one to have access to senior stuff in the discord


[10-Jul-20 01:13 PM] katie#0200
@anna okie, would it be possible for you to blacklist both accounts? the azalkus person has been fired multiple times i believe (i can‚Äôt check I‚Äôm on mobile) and the Aaron account is their alt


[10-Jul-20 01:17 PM] anna#0004
yeah katie, that's fine!


[10-Jul-20 01:19 PM] stacey#1000
HAVING 2 VERIFIED DISCORD ACCOUNTS

Greetings, MRs. 

It has been brought to the HR teams attention that many of you in the past and currently have had 2 discord accounts verified in the discord server, having 2 accounts being able to access MR+ channels. I would like to make it very clear, this is NOT permitted and you are only allowed to have ONE discord account verified in the discord server. 

    This is because of security and privacy reasons. We have no way of really knowing if it is you on a second discord account or not. We understand you may have wanted a back-up verified in case something happened to your main account, but that does not mean it‚Äôs okay to verify two discord accounts. If your main discord account got hacked for any reason, the best thing to do is inform an HR of the situation so we can deal with the issue ASAP. That is the proper way to handled these situations. 

From now on, if the HR team notices anyone with 2 verified discord accounts that can view MR+ channels, immediate action will be taken. I would like to make it very clear, this has never been permitted and is still not permitted. Keep in mind from now on you can only have ONE verified discord account in the server. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this, feel free to message any member of the HR team. 

Best regards,
staceyvx
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels.


[10-Jul-20 01:19 PM] stacey#1000
Is this good


[10-Jul-20 01:20 PM] anna#0004
lol yeah i dont really see why you would need two accounts for that either, it's not too hard to separate your dms, i mean it's fine that she has more than one account but to have them both verified just because she can't be bothered to switch isn't reasonable


[10-Jul-20 01:20 PM] bman#0435
thats good


[10-Jul-20 01:21 PM] anna#0004
yeah stacey its good


[10-Jul-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
Announcing rn


[10-Jul-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
So from now on


[10-Jul-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
If we see people with 2 verified discord accs


[10-Jul-20 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
I would say temp suspend for suspicion of being hacked


[10-Jul-20 01:22 PM] bman#0435
security codes r calling üòç


[10-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
We need a new security code document


[10-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
also how do we check every single mr acc to make sure there isn‚Äôt anyone else with 2


[10-Jul-20 01:27 PM] bman#0435
we dont :/


[10-Jul-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
I guess we just search them and see

[10-Jul-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435
i changed his card to no appeals permitted


[10-Jul-20 02:50 PM] bman#0435

ya oak had a senior card


[10-Jul-20 02:55 PM] bman#0435
i commented this


[10-Jul-20 02:55 PM] bman#0435
She is way too suspicious to consider and here is why. Firstly, I went on multiple shifts and on different occasions she would be in there server, as well as CBs, and they would come up to her and say stuff along the lines of "Hey Dorito!" or "Guys, Oaklvvy is Dorito" which makes matters worse. Secondly, I see her following me and other HRs/MRs around to servers all the time which is very unnecessary. Lastly, she just reached a month as an LR. If I was even going to consider her for a promotion, I'd like to see her at her fullest potential without assistance from MRs and HRs.

@Beartikal Can I ask why you are in the cb server as like an admin lol


[10-Jul-20 03:05 PM] stacey#1000
Did they just randomly give you the roles


[10-Jul-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
uh


[10-Jul-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
oooop


[10-Jul-20 03:07 PM] bman#0435
what ever happened to not giving them attention and not associating with them?


[10-Jul-20 03:08 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm in the server too yes but on an alt to get information. Like they trash talk people in Bloxton and are planning raids. I‚Äôm only in it for information but just as a recommendation not to be in it if you don‚Äôt have to because it does encourage CBs and other MRs to join the server too


[10-Jul-20 03:09 PM] stacey#1000
We have issue with leakers rn and I‚Äôm like 60% sure it‚Äôs an mr that‚Äôs friends with a cb in that server


[10-Jul-20 03:09 PM] bman#0435
is this why we dont get paid for admin acts


[10-Jul-20 03:10 PM] bman#0435

[10-Jul-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
then they show some MRs they are friends with on roblox and only like them because of it


[10-Jul-20 04:59 PM] stacey#1000
just saying why do CBs expect us to be their friends when they trash talk us, raid the hotel, and break rules.......?


[10-Jul-20 04:59 PM] bman#0435
y do mrs and hrs thin its ok to encourage their behavior and associate with them


[10-Jul-20 04:59 PM] bman#0435
:CPThinkv2:


[10-Jul-20 05:03 PM] courtney#5125
ya i reallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy wish that the MRs would leave. its no doubt encouraging the CBs to come and troll at the hotel, and the MRs are clearly giving them attention just by being in their discord server. im not a fan of that at all, personally :/


[10-Jul-20 05:04 PM] bman#0435
we used to tell them to not associate with cbs


[10-Jul-20 05:04 PM] bman#0435

[10-Jul-20 06:03 PM] anna#0004
may need to also test them all out again since it limits how much you can have in the chatbox


[10-Jul-20 06:03 PM] anna#0004

[10-Jul-20 08:52 PM] courtney#5125
i mean.... TO ME it just seems like kinda a hard thing to misunderstand :///


[10-Jul-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
I thought it was common sense not to kick trainees


[10-Jul-20 08:53 PM] courtney#5125
training is for trainees to get their ranks. training sessions are FOR THEM


[10-Jul-20 08:53 PM] anna#0004
same omg


[10-Jul-20 08:53 PM] anna#0004
like trainees are there to be trained, lrs already have their job


[10-Jul-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs sad


[10-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
we- the point of trainings is for the trainee üíÄ if there‚Äôs no trainees there‚Äôs no session!


[10-Jul-20 08:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that‚Äôs sad.. lol


[10-Jul-20 08:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he kicks trainees over staff


[10-Jul-20 08:59 PM] courtney#5125
what happens when theres 2 trainees


[10-Jul-20 08:59 PM] courtney#5125
and he kicks 2 trainees and 2 staff members


[10-Jul-20 09:00 PM] courtney#5125
or just when theres 3 trainees, then hes left with 1??


[10-Jul-20 09:00 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
if he was lucky enough he probably kicked staff that were re-training plus the trainees LOL


[10-Jul-20 09:00 PM] courtney#5125
i bet its happened a few times!! and the trainees are probably confused and mad too. i accidentally kicked a trainee once bc he had a super similar username as a staff member, and he literally followed me into several other games to yell at me üò≥


[10-Jul-20 09:02 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ikr u don‚Äôt mess with them trainees LOL they will go running after u


[10-Jul-20 09:03 PM] courtney#5125

mirk and maddy both had accounts with alts


[11-Jul-20 02:36 AM] ethan;#0003
or their main verified on the alt

[11-Jul-20 02:36 AM] ethan;#0003
i have a theory


[11-Jul-20 02:36 AM] ethan;#0003
maybe mirk and maddy


[11-Jul-20 02:36 AM] ethan;#0003
verified on alts


[11-Jul-20 02:36 AM] ethan;#0003
and then gave it to eachother


[11-Jul-20 02:37 AM] ethan;#0003
because mirk said he didnt know the password to the account he was verified on...


[11-Jul-20 02:37 AM] ethan;#0003
and ik that mirk and maddy are SUPER close friends


[11-Jul-20 02:37 AM] ethan;#0003
@Cam


[11-Jul-20 02:37 AM] Cam#5887
hmmm


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
damn ethan


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
thats actually


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
really good


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
so, those are our suspects, no?


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] ethan;#0003
yes


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
yes


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] ethan;#0003
should we make an investigation card


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
so that right there, we can do an investigation about


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
and


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
i think we should yes


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
but


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
idk if my proof was enough


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] Cam#5887
anyone could go into the hotel saying that an MR is leaking


[11-Jul-20 02:38 AM] ethan;#0003
because if mirk KNEW the password


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] ethan;#0003
he couldnt of forgotten it...


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
true true


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] ethan;#0003
he was talking in it like yesterday morning...


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Tattoblue#5828
thats super sus


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
hell yeah it is


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
like very sus


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] ethan;#0003
and maddy was talking on her alt the same time her main was talking


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] ethan;#0003
and they where typing at the SAME EXACT TIME


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] ethan;#0003
you cant do that if you one person...


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
true


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
unless u do mobile and PC


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] ethan;#0003
"maddqy and maddqy are typing"


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
i think an investigation card should be made


[11-Jul-20 02:39 AM] Cam#5887
but ethan


[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] ethan;#0003
you cant use two hands to type a full sentence and press send at the same time


[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] Cam#5887
does this thing correlate to the announcement in #hr-announcements


[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] ethan;#0003
its just impossable


[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] Cam#5887
my announcement to be exact


[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] ethan;#0003

[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] ethan;#0003
she doesnt say X3 and XD


[11-Jul-20 02:40 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jul-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jul-20 02:45 AM] Cam#5887
with this whole thing


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
that there is some sort of leaking?


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] ethan;#0003
mirk is on maddys account and maddy is on mirks account


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
possible account sharing


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
aaaa yes


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
account sharing


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
a nono


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] ethan;#0003
but we have no proof of it


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
thats the part that stops us


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
bad thing is


[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jul-20 02:46 AM] Cam#5887
possibly even the boards have been leaked


[11-Jul-20 02:47 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jul-20 02:47 AM] Beartikal#9760

[11-Jul-20 02:50 AM] Cam#5887
we have no proof


[11-Jul-20 02:50 AM] Cam#5887

[11-Jul-20 02:50 AM] Cam#5887
cause


[11-Jul-20 02:50 AM] Cam#5887
that would make absolutely no sense for them to do, ofc


[11-Jul-20 02:52 AM] ethan;#0003
hm


[11-Jul-20 02:53 AM] ethan;#0003

[11-Jul-20 02:54 AM] Cam#5887
they do


[11-Jul-20 02:55 AM] Cam#5887
we should put that in hr announcements

Suspend both Madi and mirk and ask for their security codes if you are suspicious it‚Äôs not them


[11-Jul-20 04:49 AM] stacey#1000
But if you think they are acc sharing gl

[11-Jul-20 05:19 PM] anna#0004
i mean if she actually has valid reasons then obviously its not her fault, but it isss a reoccurring thing so i mean, she could be verbally warned i'd say


[11-Jul-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
The excuses ive heard from her is shes fallen asleep


[11-Jul-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000

[11-Jul-20 05:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[11-Jul-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000

@stacey she told me why


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
she has baby brothers


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
who she has to take care of


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
and she said whenever she is afk at the start of a session that means she is taking care of them


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
but like going afk and not leaving the server or informing an hr is not good


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
if she has to do that


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
she told me after


[11-Jul-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
she should inform an hr or leave the server


[11-Jul-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
like there is no excuse she cant tell us AFTER the session all the time


[11-Jul-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
if she has stuff to do irl she should leave the server and tell an hr she has to leave when it happens


[11-Jul-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
it happens too often


[11-Jul-20 05:30 PM] katie#0200
she fell asleep at my trainings once right before she was supposed to train


[11-Jul-20 05:30 PM] katie#0200
but that was only once


[11-Jul-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
shes done this legit like 4-5 times now at my sessions


[11-Jul-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
it shouldnt be happening this often


[11-Jul-20 09:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[11-Jul-20 09:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well one just decided out of nowhere to retrain after the countdown...and when I allowed her to she was like never I can help...one decided it was his job to make himself a security helper attempting to do pips job. and then I feel like a fight was about to break out in the corner of my eye because I seen something along the lines of did you call me a rat


[11-Jul-20 09:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
one small thing: two decided to just up and go in the training rooms without permission

@High Rank There will be no meeting on July 18th. As you all may know, COVID cases are increasing a fast rate in all jurisdictions in North America. Today, I have worked over 14 hours preparing our resources for this second wave. 

It is also incredibly depressing to have 0 Robux in your account, after having over 150k+ -- I'm still getting this resolved with Roblox but once it's restored, I will be more motivated to continue meeting with you wonderful folks.

I'm aiming for the next meeting to be July 25th. I will be taking note of the attendance. I have an existing agenda, but I would like some people to come up with topics, as we have had some time to think about what could make BH better since June. 

I will be trying my best to get Baby & Bear in attendance so they can hear how productive these meetings can get -- and how fast we can actually respond and bring change to this group. It really is impressive when you folks are all in one chatroom, and the same time.

Stay safe, seriously.

written warning


[14-Jul-20 08:30 AM] katie#0200
yes


[14-Jul-20 08:36 AM] bman#0435
mirk is very immature and ignorant nowadays


[14-Jul-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
Honestly hasn‚Äôt he been warned before for his behaviour, etc? He might actually need a suspension...


[14-Jul-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
I would say suspension tbh. You should add a vote @Tattoblue


[14-Jul-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
If he was verbally warned for this already he should be suspended this time


[14-Jul-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
Like he‚Äôs shown a warning does nothing.


[14-Jul-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm posting a vote


[14-Jul-20 08:59 AM] bman#0435
he was verbally warned for that


[14-Jul-20 09:00 AM] bman#0435
but he was warned by me before for immaturity


[14-Jul-20 09:01 AM] stacey#1000
So this time he needs a suspension


[14-Jul-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
If he was warned verbally for the exact same thing and still does it a written warning won‚Äôt do anything


[14-Jul-20 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
There is not that much of a difference between a verbal and written warning


[14-Jul-20 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
And if he has warnings for maturity on top of that then yeah 100% suspension


[14-Jul-20 09:04 AM] bman#0435
ye


[14-Jul-20 11:21 AM] bman#0435

I think I‚Äôve got all the information needed to suspend gotmestartcd now and I got the votes. I‚Äôm not going to question her I‚Äôm just going to suspend her later


[14-Jul-20 02:27 PM] bman#0435
im angling towards a longer suspension for getmestartcd


[14-Jul-20 02:27 PM] bman#0435
mainly because shes like encouraging trolling and purposely passes them


[14-Jul-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
wait wouldnt that be a termination


[14-Jul-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
she is purposely passing cbs for them to abuse and troll


[14-Jul-20 02:28 PM] bman#0435
and is encouraging cbs to do what theyre doing


[14-Jul-20 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
There is no evidence she passes them tho. The only evidence is she asks them to go to interviews.


[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
This is her first offence so it will be a 3 day suspension


[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
but she claims she did


[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
like she said "again"


[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
Should I question her first?


[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
so she basically framed herself

[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
i dont see why not, but dont be surprised when she gives u some bs response and turns to the cb server


[14-Jul-20 02:29 PM] bman#0435
asking who reported her


[14-Jul-20 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I don‚Äôt see a need to question her when the evidence speaks for itself and she would still end up getting suspended either way.


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
So yeah I‚Äôm just going to suspend her


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] bman#0435
do a vote!!!!!!


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
She has 6 votes already


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
For a suspension


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] bman#0435
im leaning towards either a long suspension or termiantion


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] bman#0435
wait what


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] bman#0435
OHHHH


[14-Jul-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
I did a vote last night already

But sure yeah I‚Äôll make the letter rn


[14-Jul-20 02:32 PM] bman#0435
ill just rename the investigation card


[14-Jul-20 02:32 PM] bman#0435

[14-Jul-20 02:33 PM] bman#0435

Greetings, gotmestartcd. 

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as rank 8 from Bloxton Hotels as of July 14th at approximately 3:45 PM EST. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to encouraging CBs to attend interviews, and taking part in trash talking other users in a CB owned discord server. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. You may be friends with a CB if you wish, but when you encourage others to take part in trash talking and encourage CBs to attend an interview, that is where issues arise. Your suspension is due to conclude on July 17th at 3:45 PM EST and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Greetings mirkyxmaddyxtatto,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as 10 | Head Receptionist from Bloxton Hotels as of July 14th at 7:30 PM EST. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to ignorance and failure to comply with the MR limit at sessions upon multiple occasions. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude at July 17 at 7:30 PM EST and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

The most i've did right now was report him to roblox and fill out an archive report because he left before I could put it on file.


[14-Jul-20 09:07 PM] bman#0435
@KjRBLX idk if theres much u can do abt that


[14-Jul-20 09:08 PM] bman#0435
since the first one isnt rly enough to take action against, and the second one is just tags

Still


[15-Jul-20 12:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs not like he said I hate Muslims


[15-Jul-20 12:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Idk


[15-Jul-20 12:53 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Idk why he would even ask someone that


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Why would you ask someone if you hate a certain race of religion


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs not like he said yes they should all die


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435
because he said turkey is a muslim country


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435
so he wouldnt go


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435
and then he asked that


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] bman#0435
and said kinda


[15-Jul-20 12:54 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[15-Jul-20 12:55 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

warn


[15-Jul-20 12:56 PM] bman#0435
nothing too major


[15-Jul-20 12:56 PM] bman#0435
but it is still discriminatory


[15-Jul-20 12:56 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[15-Jul-20 12:56 PM] bman#0435

To the HRs.
Hello HRs at Bloxton Hotels,    I have noticed some rules at the hotel that, in my opinion, are causing BH‚Äôs reputation and the current success to go down quite dramatically.  So, first let‚Äôs also set some things straight as well. I know I‚Äôm a CB and that I apparently cause tr...

[15-Jul-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
I mean tbh I think it‚Äôs great the cbs are like trying to give suggestions and such but the issue is they are  suggestions we already do. We already try our best to enforce a staff limit on servers and we don‚Äôt just base promotions off of activity lmao. Like if we see someone immature they are not going to ever get a promotion. The problem I have is they want us to treat them with more respect and such and be friends with them but how can they expect that when all they do is trash talk is and treat us like crap in return. I‚Äôve seen what they say in their cb server and the things I‚Äôve seen them say about me being highly inappropriate alone shows I cannot respect them, let alone trust them. They ask us for stuff when they don‚Äôt show us the same in return. I‚Äôd like to not take suggestions from someone that trash talks me and talks highly inappropriate about the HR team alone.


[15-Jul-20 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
If I have to join the cb server on my main itself and explain that to them I will.


[15-Jul-20 02:03 PM] bman#0435
theyre only making it a suggestion because theyre gonna act the way they suggested to us on their alts to get promoted


[15-Jul-20 02:04 PM] bman#0435
they have no place to tell us how to do or change our jobs lol


[15-Jul-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly. They really have no clue how the promotion system works


[15-Jul-20 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
They show us 0 respect so why should we respect them.

[15-Jul-20 02:05 PM] bman#0435
LOL


[15-Jul-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
They think them going to the hotel and trolling helps us, no it just makes our jobs harder by having to figure out they are a CB and ban their accounts. I hate to break it to them, but there was trollers before them and there is always other trollers that‚Äôs not a CB as well.


[15-Jul-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
Legit I might just have to join their CB server on my main acc to explain this to them respectfully.


[15-Jul-20 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
This is the second time in a week they have sent us an essay thing.


[15-Jul-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435
theyll just call u toxic for disagreein with them

[15-Jul-20 02:07 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jul-20 02:07 PM] stacey#1000

the fact they tried to make them being a cb look like a POSTIVIE is funny


[15-Jul-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs really funny how they think they know how we promote people too. It‚Äôs not just about activity and never has been


[15-Jul-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
Like there is a reason some people aren‚Äôt getting promoted

If I legit have to join their cb server on my main to explain that to them I will

i wouldn't even bother doing that

they want attention


[15-Jul-20 02:47 PM] xM_inn#2821

like all of the stuff they've said


[15-Jul-20 02:48 PM] xM_inn#2821
i gotta say, this generation of CBs are the rudest i've seen so far

[15-Jul-20 02:49 PM] bman#0435

[15-Jul-20 02:52 PM] courtney#5125
they say all they want is to get a milkshake and enjoy the hotel, but that‚Äôs the one thing they absolutely don‚Äôt want to do


[15-Jul-20 02:53 PM] courtney#5125
smh


[15-Jul-20 02:53 PM] courtney#5125
Whenever they join they always end up trolling, bypassing, or just commit other major offenses :/


[15-Jul-20 02:53 PM] courtney#5125
they join purely for attention and to be a more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù cb, they don‚Äôt join bc they love the hotel


[15-Jul-20 02:57 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly. They trash talk us and talk highly inappropriate about the HR team in their little CB server and expect us to respect them lmao.

[15-Jul-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
The cbs from last year understood they caused us pain


[15-Jul-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
And that we hated it


[15-Jul-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
These ones seem to care less


[15-Jul-20 03:32 PM] ethan;#0003
But want us to feel sympathy for them for some apparent reason


[15-Jul-20 03:32 PM] stacey#1000
The cbs now are really disrespectful and selfish tbh. Like they talk really inappropriate about every single HR and like fr are you serious.


[15-Jul-20 03:33 PM] stacey#1000
They make their nicknames in their discord server really inappropriate. I would send an example but it‚Äôs too inappropriate oml

[15-Jul-20 06:25 PM] courtney#5125

[15-Jul-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
that was in a different server im not in


[15-Jul-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
I didnt want to join it, it wouldve exposed my alt acc


[15-Jul-20 06:25 PM] courtney#5125
ahhhhhhhh


[15-Jul-20 06:25 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Jul-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
in the cb server she just talks to them about everyday things


[15-Jul-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
and is friends with them


[15-Jul-20 06:26 PM] stacey#1000

i mean ur allowed to think those things and have ur opinions, but its really not fine to go ahead and voice those things about ppl, especially when its done as a group and when its coming from ppl who are supposed to be our professional mrs


[15-Jul-20 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
there is stuff a lot worse Minn

XDDDDDDDDDD


[15-Jul-20 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
if the thing with vedom continues then I would DM the MRs doing it and inform them to stop


[15-Jul-20 06:31 PM] bman#0435
if only they knew i promoted her and not candy


[15-Jul-20 06:32 PM] courtney#5125
yeah honestly i havent seen any specific mr constantly trash talking him, but whenever his name is brought up in staff lounge, several mrs always have nasty things to say abt him


[15-Jul-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
rn they trash talking alistelle now


[15-Jul-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
in the cb server


[15-Jul-20 06:32 PM] bman#0435
speaking of alistelle


[15-Jul-20 06:32 PM] bman#0435
y r people randomly suggesting her to me??


[15-Jul-20 06:32 PM] courtney#5125

one thing i saw they said about me made me really uncomfortable


[15-Jul-20 06:33 PM] courtney#5125
and they say they refrained from doing stuff around the "Tremma situation", but thats kind of one of the times i saw them coming to spam the most-


[15-Jul-20 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
they have 0 respect


[15-Jul-20 06:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
At least Swan and the others had somewhat respect for us..


[15-Jul-20 06:33 PM] bman#0435

He's Alabama-bound with a load of bananas,
Headin' south across the Mason-Dixon line.

Then he's haulin' pineapples to Gary, Indiana.
Gotta burn some rubber, make that highway whine.

@ethan; how did interviews go if you still hosted. I know they were targeting that too


[16-Jul-20 07:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Jul-20 07:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Jul-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
They can shutdown a hotel server and a new one will form fast


[16-Jul-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not as major as them trying to shutdown a session

i mean theres like a billion questions you could ask but ok lol


[18-Jul-20 01:28 AM] bman#0435
not really


[18-Jul-20 01:29 AM] impact#0297
QOTD is nice on paper, but it's a online dating mess in practice


[18-Jul-20 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
online dating


[18-Jul-20 01:29 AM] Beartikal#9760
what r u talking about lo
--


[18-Jul-20 01:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
i should rlly get to making a discord bot for Bloxton


[18-Jul-20 01:30 AM] Beartikal#9760
maybe one that pulls the next sessions or answers questions or something ü§î


[18-Jul-20 01:31 AM] impact#0297
well the QOTD are usually not used unless they provoke a response from the reader


[18-Jul-20 01:31 AM] impact#0297
in order to provoke a response from the reader, the question is usually: political, controversial, emotional, etc


[18-Jul-20 01:32 AM] impact#0297
maybe online dating wasn't the best conclusion, but it just mixes more drama into the server -- which we really don't need


[18-Jul-20 01:32 AM] impact#0297
otherwise, if the QOTD does not provoke a response, it's a waste of time to brainstorm by our high ranks


[18-Jul-20 01:40 AM] Beartikal#9760
u see this in the shower what do u do

[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Cam#5887
i get harassed too much


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Cam#5887
so


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
they are really bad for crashing servers rn


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Cam#5887
im done w/ it unless someone absolutely needs me


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
and yeah I dont go there either


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] stacey#1000
every time an hr joins


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Cam#5887
that tea video really fucked me up


[18-Jul-20 11:50 AM] Cam#5887
the damn rumors and lies that were spread


[18-Jul-20 11:51 AM] stacey#1000
yeah they are really disrespectful


[18-Jul-20 11:51 AM] Cam#5887
"can u come on my field trip, cam?"


[18-Jul-20 11:51 AM] Cam#5887
is what i see all the time


[18-Jul-20 11:51 AM] Cam#5887
its really, really rude


[18-Jul-20 11:51 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Maybe there just sending unnecessary request to the server üßê


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
legit this generation of cbs are really inappropriate and disrespectful


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] Cam#5887
ye


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] Cam#5887
some CBs respect me


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] Cam#5887
but most dont


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
they have said really inappropriate things about me that make me uncomfortable


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] stacey#1000
like they have 0 respect


[18-Jul-20 11:52 AM] Cam#5887
yea


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
it sucks


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
and i cant ban them for asking me the question i said above


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
cause its not a major offense


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
well actually...


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
it sort of is


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
thats cyberbullying


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
which is against roblox ToS


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
if they are being inappropriate and doing that


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
therefore, it actually is a major offense


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] stacey#1000
yeah I would ban them


[18-Jul-20 11:53 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[18-Jul-20 11:54 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I had someone looking for me at the hotel to come and ban himself


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
CBs wonder why HRs dont go to the hotel too


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
like they ruin it


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
they make me not want to go there


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I edited that text so much


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] stacey#1000
rip


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] Cam#5887
they make me not want to go there either


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] Cam#5887
the only things that i have fun with in bloxton is of course my position and responsibilites and sessions


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] Cam#5887
but the hotel


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] Cam#5887
they ruined it for me


[18-Jul-20 11:55 AM] Cam#5887
absolutely ruined it


[18-Jul-20 11:56 AM] Cam#5887
and thats not against bear and baby, thats simply cause of how i get treated


[18-Jul-20 11:56 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I don‚Äôt get bullied i believe, but at the same time I get loads of request to come and ban


[18-Jul-20 11:57 AM] Cam#5887
yeah we get ban requests, but Kj, the reason you dont get harassed is because there wasnt a tea video made of you that spread fake crap and lies


[18-Jul-20 11:57 AM] Cam#5887
if i ever go to the hotel and you see me there, feel free to join, you'll see immediately everything that happens


[18-Jul-20 11:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah i saw vid, im sure we all get ban request

@Beartikal yo the ball room one is a good idea, people can pay robux to rent it out. Koala has a similar concept with a party room


[18-Jul-20 04:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Used to have a ballroom..I threw like a staff party in it once just out of random

hello customer support

i am here for talkative role


[18-Jul-20 08:29 PM] ethan;#0003
i think we should re-announce the dm etiquette rule


[18-Jul-20 08:29 PM] ethan;#0003
because nobody follows it


[18-Jul-20 08:30 PM] ethan;#0003
i get like 100 dms a day that are just "Hello?"


[18-Jul-20 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
same


[18-Jul-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000

[18-Jul-20 08:52 PM] Beartikal#9760

[18-Jul-20 09:09 PM] ethan;#0003
@Beartikal the olny reason id say no is because people would think its free range and post offensive memes and memes with profanity


[18-Jul-20 09:12 PM] bman#0435
agreed with ethan.. 99% of memes r offensive, inappropriate, or contain profanity


[18-Jul-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah a lot of people would likely take offence to some of the memes


[18-Jul-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
Even if it was for MRs+ only to post

[19-Jul-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
You guys should be checking that more and if you don‚Äôt vote at least comment why you are not voting.


[19-Jul-20 01:50 PM] courtney#5125
yk i wouldnt be mad if ppl voted on 1 or both of mine too :shy:

@anna @bman


[19-Jul-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Hi I see you are online so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm tagging you


[19-Jul-20 01:53 PM] bman#0435
idk who any of the people suggested are üò≠


[19-Jul-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Just look at what I said tho above


[19-Jul-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
You don‚Äôt need to know who they are you can look at what seniors have said and look at their report activity.  Remember just because you may have not seen them doesn‚Äôt mean they are not active there is different time zones and such


[19-Jul-20 01:55 PM] bman#0435
tru


[19-Jul-20 01:55 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I‚Äôm going to announce for this.


[19-Jul-20 01:56 PM] courtney#5125
yeah bc for dawson_z, ive seen him a lot, but 6/7 of teh seniors that commented on his card agreed


[19-Jul-20 01:56 PM] stacey#1000
Y‚Äôall are bad for not even commenting why you don‚Äôt vote lol


[19-Jul-20 01:57 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah if a lot of seniors agree on a promotion suggestion it‚Äôs a good sign.


[19-Jul-20 01:59 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk you are online too so I‚Äôm tagging you too :))

just saying dont listen to the cbs trying to convince you they are lagging with plates again


[19-Jul-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
cause its a completely diff scrip that lags the chat to kill the server


[19-Jul-20 06:32 PM] Beartikal#9760

Like the remote they add in auto


[19-Jul-20 06:33 PM] babymariobebe#7563
They're spamming the chat with random symbols until the server crashes


[19-Jul-20 06:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
translation: spam Roblox's Chat event with completely random characters and in a non-existing channel to spam warning messages to console, crashing the server


[19-Jul-20 06:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah

@babymariobebe actually the cbs love trying to get a session cancelled by lagging the server lol. They lagged one of my training servers earlier either that exploit that just got patched at the hotel so yes I recommend adding it at interviews and trainings.

[19-Jul-20 09:33 PM] stacey#1000

@RAMMGaming ye id just verbally warn saab abt the question thing


[19-Jul-20 09:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Idc that much


[19-Jul-20 09:38 PM] bman#0435
she seems to think she gets some type of attention for answering every question


[19-Jul-20 09:38 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It‚Äôs just kinda silly


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
well ik that but she shouldnt be doing that


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I‚Äôll keep an eye on it


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
She just tryna help


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
its happened more than once tho


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But if it happens again; then I‚Äôll know it‚Äôs for shuts and giggles


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
ramm.. shes done this on multiple occasions and is flat out trying to look like she knows it all


[19-Jul-20 09:39 PM] bman#0435
she needs to be put in her place and know she cant answer every single question and that if someone already answered a question theres no need for her to do the same


[19-Jul-20 09:40 PM] bman#0435
its happened twice, maybe more times now. how many more times r u gonna let it happen?


[19-Jul-20 09:40 PM] courtney#5125
shuts


[19-Jul-20 09:40 PM] courtney#5125
anywho


[19-Jul-20 09:40 PM] courtney#5125
its weird how shes doing it. it just seems like she thinks shes better and has a better answer for it, even tho shes giving the exact same answer or just a worse one ://


[19-Jul-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt pay attention to the questions channel tbh


[19-Jul-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
I only answer a question of people dm me directly


[19-Jul-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
this was basically one of the reasons heads cant answer questions anymore. more than 1 head would try to answer questions and theyd give inaccurate info


[19-Jul-20 09:41 PM] courtney#5125
i mean i think shes more than welcome to answer questions to her hearts desire, but its just kind of rude and unnecessary to answer one thats already been answered perfectly


[19-Jul-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
But if Saab is doing that yeah I would remind her not to if it was answered


[19-Jul-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
i suggested that only managers could do it üòç


[19-Jul-20 09:49 PM] stacey#1000

idk it just bugged me that he made a whole announcement abt someone getting scammed and said that if ppl supported the hacker then theyre apart of the problem

[20-Jul-20 01:18 AM] courtney#5125
Note: Those who defend xC_alebs over his actions are considered aiding him for purchasing hacked items. That's how it works in the real life people. Don't let them get away with it. Be sure to announce this in your servers.

"Ive had too many tea docs made of me, keep your head high"


[20-Jul-20 01:19 AM] courtney#5125
him bringing attention to the doc just makes it seem like he feels the need to defend himself

it just feels unnecessary

i mean, its nice for him to say that its false


[20-Jul-20 01:21 AM] xM_inn#2821
The document itself is hilarious as there is no evidence to support the alleged claims.. therefore I see no problems concerning Boba within the initial document itself. However, my concern is the way Boba addressed the document, particularly the founder. It's simply unprofessional and **bringing drama into their company** in doing so. I think a warning against them would be appropriate, however a removal of alliance doesn't seem justified at the moment. Boba should be closely reviewed and kept under eye over the next few weeks though for any other problems that may arise. Opinions??

[20-Jul-20 01:21 AM] Cam#5887
yeah i agree min


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] courtney#5125
agreed


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] bman#0435
ya i agree, but its rly unprofessional and immature of them to do


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] ethan;#0003
ive never liked the owenr of boba


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] bman#0435
and their community is literally asking for more docs


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] xM_inn#2821
Awesome


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'm glad y'all agree


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] courtney#5125
id hate to not be allies with them anymore


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] xM_inn#2821
@Hilton Founder Perms to issue an alliance warning against Boba for the above issues?


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] ethan;#0003
ik that he isnt the original owner


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] bman#0435
he literally friended me before boba allied, the unfriended me once bh allied with boba


[20-Jul-20 01:22 AM] ethan;#0003
he bought the group or scammed it idk


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] bman#0435
so he practically used me for my rank


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] bman#0435
even tho i was a senior


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] ethan;#0003
because he likes to falsely accuse people of scamming is what im aware of


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] bman#0435
lol


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
What Flez did was a really bad PR move for his company


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
It's just causing drama and problems..


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] Cam#5887
i agree


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
It's just giving the person who created the document the attention they wanted in making the document


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] Cam#5887
Exactly


[20-Jul-20 01:23 AM] bman#0435
he literally encouraged the doc owner


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OMG same @bman


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] bman#0435
and now theyre gonna get MORE docs


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] bman#0435
knowing its getting announced


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] bman#0435
and getting the attention they wanted


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] bman#0435
so


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] Cam#5887
i agree with a warn


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] Cam#5887
100 percent


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] bman#0435
is the ally warning system the same as like a staff member warning system


[20-Jul-20 01:24 AM] bman#0435
like 3 strikes and ur done

Cuz we hardly ever warn alliances


[20-Jul-20 01:26 AM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan; That's the past though and it concerns Flez not Boba. That video was also published before we allied with them so it's too late to take action now, even if we wanted to.


[20-Jul-20 01:31 AM] bman#0435

If Jz_sy was in your server then it was that server

[20-Jul-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
We don't want to raise much suspicion against her


[20-Jul-20 01:52 AM] courtney#5125
I‚Äôm almost certain it was Ava. She had a staff account called ‚Äúvivi_anne‚Äù a while back


[20-Jul-20 01:52 AM] Cam#5887
true true


[20-Jul-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
Vivi is defo ava


[20-Jul-20 01:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
Same status n everything


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Cam#5887
100% without a doubt


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
and it's something ava would do


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] courtney#5125
And Ava has exposed a lot of things in-game regarding her old friends names and where they live


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] courtney#5125
Yeahhh


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
Wow wth


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Cam#5887
this is exactly why ava is a CB now


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] Cam#5887
these damn CBs


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
So


[20-Jul-20 01:53 AM] xM_inn#2821
The only thing is


[20-Jul-20 01:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'm not sure if it was a leaker, Jz_sy is saying she definitely only sent the letter in staff lounge. However, I'm wondering if she's maybe sent it to one of her close friends who happens to be a non-MR and drama has happened or whatever and that close friend has then shared the document to whoever else.


[20-Jul-20 01:54 AM] xM_inn#2821
So it could be a leaker, but it could not be a leaker. :shrug:


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
couldve also been a former mr


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
Yea idk


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
Cause like


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
possibly one of the seniors that r blacklisted


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
The letter was sent 30th of June.... it's now the 20th of July


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] bman#0435
but i agree with ur statement abt jessie, cuz she has lied a bunch and may have forgotten if she sent it to other people so


[20-Jul-20 01:55 AM] xM_inn#2821
Mhm idk about jessie, just gotta be careful with her cause her statements aren't always 100% accurate


[20-Jul-20 01:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
Either way if it is a leaker, y'all have a right to know


[20-Jul-20 01:56 AM] xM_inn#2821
So if you find anything else out, post it here


[20-Jul-20 01:57 AM] KjRBLX#2053
does anyone else go to Vivi_anne19 account and get automatically sent to her inventory?


[20-Jul-20 01:58 AM] KjRBLX#2053

@bonnie591 sometimes managers name a head that isn‚Äôt head of security to train security because lrs can‚Äôt use the cuffs at the tc


[20-Jul-20 12:52 PM] katie#0200
but heads can


[20-Jul-20 12:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
well two options


[20-Jul-20 12:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
either do the demonstration with a trainee or the managements train


[20-Jul-20 01:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
@management @senior management 

**NAMING HEADS TO TRAIN/HELP**

Hi, quick reminder on naming heads to train at sessions! You should always assign heads to train their rank if possible, for example:

Head of Security should be chosen to train **Security.**
Head of Services should be chosen to train **Housekeeping or Bartender.**
Head Receptionist should be chosen to train **Receptionist.**

This should be followed at all times unless this certain condition is met:

-There is no unnamed head that should train that rank in the server.
-There is already a head of the same rank training the trainees OR there's no trainees for the head's rank.

If there's no Head of Security in the server to train Security trainees you have a two options instead of picking another head of a different rank and leaving their rank with an LR trainer.

**OPTION 1** The LR trains security as normal and they use a trainee to demonstrate OR you cuff the trainer and help in the demonstration.

**OPTION 2** A management trains security.

So to conclude this is what I should see happening:

**EXAMPLE 1** 

**4 HEADS IN THE SERVER**
-2 Head of Services
-1 Head Receptionist
-1 Head of Security

One of the Head of Services trains Housekeeping
One of the  Head of Services trains Bartender.
The Head of Security trains Security.
The Head Receptionist trains Reception.

If there isn't any trainees for one of those ranks, the head of that rank should be kicked with excess or asked to help in the rare occasion of a shortage of LRs.

**EXAMPLE 2** 

Only a Head Receptionist and Head of Security in the server. 

There's only trainees for Security and Bartender.

-The head of security trains security as normal.
-The head receptionist trains Bartender.

**WHAT I SHOULD NOT SEE**

Head Receptionist training Bartender.
Head of Services training Reception.
Head of Security training Housekeeping.
Head of Services training security.

of them asking u to ban someone or demote/suspend someone


[20-Jul-20 09:40 PM] bman#0435
and the mrs act like they cant use the report channels


[20-Jul-20 09:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Staff discussion? More like the cry for help channel


[20-Jul-20 09:41 PM] bman#0435
they think that sd is thei report channel

and private access to hrs lol


[20-Jul-20 09:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
We should only get pinged if it's a massive emergency. If someone is abusing cuffs just kick then and report it


[20-Jul-20 09:42 PM] bman#0435
can we like reestablish that channels use


[20-Jul-20 09:42 PM] bman#0435

[20-Jul-20 09:42 PM] bonnie591#0591

[20-Jul-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
i thought we had a rule saying not to ping us in SD if were on dnd ü§°


[20-Jul-20 09:48 PM] bman#0435
apparently we dont to the MRs


[20-Jul-20 09:49 PM] Cam#5887
nono bman


[20-Jul-20 09:49 PM] Cam#5887
the rule was


[20-Jul-20 09:49 PM] Cam#5887
if our status says DND and if we are on DND


[20-Jul-20 09:49 PM] Cam#5887
i believe


[20-Jul-20 09:49 PM] Cam#5887
correct if i‚Äôm wrong


[20-Jul-20 09:50 PM] bman#0435
whichever it is, DND means DND


[20-Jul-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
also


[20-Jul-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
why is it


[20-Jul-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
that emily can ATTEND my sessions


[20-Jul-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
but cant host them??


[20-Jul-20 09:51 PM] bman#0435
:thinkception:


[20-Jul-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
the last time she asked me to host was may


[20-Jul-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
and she only hosted for me once a month


[20-Jul-20 09:52 PM] bman#0435
the other times i had to beg or ask her to host


[20-Jul-20 09:53 PM] bman#0435
and i miss getting immediate reactions to the hr announcements üòî


[20-Jul-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
The MRs don‚Äôt actually ping me often for assistance so...


[20-Jul-20 10:13 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not really overused that much.


[20-Jul-20 10:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
u got 5 votes noob @bman


[20-Jul-20 10:14 PM] bman#0435

[20-Jul-20 10:14 PM] bman#0435
@stacey ye but they still dont use it for its correct purpose


[20-Jul-20 10:14 PM] bman#0435
:/


[20-Jul-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe because I go offline so they can‚Äôt ping me for assistance


[20-Jul-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
.


[20-Jul-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000

@Bloo_Berriez well now what LOL


[20-Jul-20 10:15 PM] bman#0435
do i have to like draft what i think it should be re-established to, or-


[20-Jul-20 10:15 PM] stacey#1000
Although for some reason even when I‚Äôm on offline on discord and at work it happened 2 days in a row, people pinged me for assistance when I was legit offline at work and it annoyed me


[20-Jul-20 10:16 PM] stacey#1000
Like....why ping me when I‚Äôm clearly not online....

Ooo


[20-Jul-20 10:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@bman make sure to include MRs in the discussion for channel reforms


[20-Jul-20 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
@bman pls add to it if an hr is clearly not online on discord not to ping them for assistance.


[20-Jul-20 10:17 PM] stacey#1000
Cause they still love to ping me when I‚Äôm on offline at 8:30am at work :)))


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming wdym by that


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
they think that channel is for private calls for hrs


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
lol


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Isn‚Äôt that what it‚Äôs for


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
requesting an HR


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] bman#0435
not for every little thin


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
such as


[20-Jul-20 10:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Bans


[20-Jul-20 10:19 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@RAMMGaming wat u going on about


[20-Jul-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
yes, its for hr assistance. not, its not for calling hrs to ban someone that was kicked 3 times or to demote someone that cuffed someone on accident


[20-Jul-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
they try to avoid reports channels


[20-Jul-20 10:19 PM] bman#0435
and use staff discussion as their own private reports channels


[20-Jul-20 10:19 PM] stacey#1000
They should only request for an hr if there is a raid or a bunch of cbs that keep rejoining


[20-Jul-20 10:19 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok that‚Äôs fair, so what do you consider major? Someone that violates major rule criteria correct?


[20-Jul-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs a staff abusing I usually just tell them to kick them


[20-Jul-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
Raiding is major


[20-Jul-20 10:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok obv


[20-Jul-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
Cbs rejoining a million times and annoying them is major


[20-Jul-20 10:20 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But like how are MRs gonna call you then, DM every online HR?


[20-Jul-20 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
No


[20-Jul-20 10:21 PM] stacey#1000
We are not saying not to use staff discussion for when it‚Äôs needed


[20-Jul-20 10:21 PM] stacey#1000
They can still ping us but only should when it‚Äôs needed not for a report every time


[20-Jul-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Im just thinking about from an MRs perspective


[20-Jul-20 10:22 PM] stacey#1000
Can we change the being kicked 3 times to being kicked 10 times for it to be considered major enough to ask for an hr


[20-Jul-20 10:22 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Like they are gonna have to keep kicking them, when I could just ping an HR to come ban them for me


[20-Jul-20 10:22 PM] bman#0435
what id consider major or use that channel for:
raiding
interview and training center emergencies, where the HR can just ban from their server
discussions that theyd like to be seen, like their opinions on stuff


[20-Jul-20 10:22 PM] stacey#1000
Because they ask for an hr if they were only kicked 3 times


[20-Jul-20 10:22 PM] bman#0435
the mrs will avoid report channels at all costs for some unknown reason


[20-Jul-20 10:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Well if I‚Äôm a management im not gonna wait 4 hours for an HR to ban them on the board


[20-Jul-20 10:23 PM] stacey#1000
Oh another one that‚Äôs major. DQAF being an annoying person lagging servers at sessions


[20-Jul-20 10:23 PM] bman#0435
they cant ping us every 10 minutes, expecting us to be available 24/7 for somethng that was already reported for by an lr and is pending a consequence for


[20-Jul-20 10:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Because they are gonna have to kick them over and over


[20-Jul-20 10:23 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I agree with that, they shouldn‚Äôt ping you every 10 minutes


[20-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Have them DM you then


[20-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But you can‚Äôt tell an MR to screw ofc if they have someone who meets the criteria to be banned


[20-Jul-20 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
I think if we changed being kicked 3 times to like 5+ times or 10+ times then they can request for an hr because I don‚Äôt think 3 times is major enough.


[20-Jul-20 10:24 PM] bman#0435
but whats the difference between dming and pinging in satff discussion


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
exactly bman, you‚Äôre gonna tell MRs now that you cant DM me to ask for someone to be banned?


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] bman#0435
regardless, we have given them way too many reminders on the channel usage and its clear they dont care what its supposed to be used for or how to use it. thats y i proposed the announcement


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
The only way that they can be banned is if it‚Äôs on the board


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] stacey#1000
Because they ping for 3 times someone was kicked. That‚Äôs not major


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] bman#0435
i never said they cant dm me to ask for soemone to be banned


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Ok, making it major is different


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] bman#0435
but either way, y cant they use a report channel


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Not just raids


[20-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Because it takes hours sir


[20-Jul-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And they don‚Äôt have the luxury of banning


[20-Jul-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
So they have to kick


[20-Jul-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
And keep kicking


[20-Jul-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Until they stop joining


[20-Jul-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
I say make it major violations only


[20-Jul-20 10:26 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs fair


[20-Jul-20 10:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Not limited to just raids and interviews/training problems


[20-Jul-20 10:27 PM] stacey#1000
Ok the main thing I think should be in the announcement or new rules or whatever:

-don‚Äôt ping HRs if they are clearly offline (that annoys me the most, they do it to me a lot)
-if an HRs status is dnd do not ping them
-being kicked 3 times is not major enough to request for an HR. It must be rejoining multiple times like 5+ times.


[20-Jul-20 10:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Fair


[20-Jul-20 10:27 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Works for me


[20-Jul-20 10:27 PM] bman#0435
sorry i had to rank peeps


[20-Jul-20 10:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That is a fair trade off


[20-Jul-20 10:28 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Major as indicated in rule channel


[20-Jul-20 10:28 PM] bman#0435
i agree with that stacey


[20-Jul-20 10:28 PM] stacey#1000
If any mr still pings me when I‚Äôm offline after this is changed I‚Äôm giving them a warning


[20-Jul-20 10:29 PM] bman#0435
im just tired of getting pinged by mrs to ban the most minor of stuff that can be sent in report channels


[20-Jul-20 10:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
not a written make it a verbal


[20-Jul-20 10:29 PM] bman#0435
im tired of being pinged in that channel in general lol


[20-Jul-20 10:29 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That‚Äôs fair bman


[20-Jul-20 10:29 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I would just dm them to remind them


[20-Jul-20 10:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It sounded like you wanted to change it to only raids and such


[20-Jul-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
Bman do what I do and be fake offline!!!


[20-Jul-20 10:30 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That would‚Äôve been too narrow imo


[20-Jul-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
Idk if anything else needs to be changed


[20-Jul-20 10:30 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs all I got to suggest


[20-Jul-20 10:32 PM] bman#0435
@RAMMGaming well not exactly, i just dont like how they use that channel as their own private reports channel.. that isnt its intended use. never has been, never will be


[20-Jul-20 10:36 PM] bman#0435
@courtney do you have any secondary servers

How bored are they wth


[21-Jul-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
This generation of cbs: rude, disrespectful like heck, waste their time, and think it‚Äôs funny to crash servers at sessions and now at game nights sad.


[21-Jul-20 10:36 AM] courtney#5125

@stacey btw I kept getting that exploiter banned. They never really learnt that teleporting to me instantly gives me proof of exploiting whereas just lagging wouldn't so I could just keep reporting and getting them banned in a minute. Xoxo


[21-Jul-20 08:48 PM] bonnie591#0591

[21-Jul-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[21-Jul-20 08:57 PM] ethan;#0003
why does omer ask to host 20 minutes after everyone else asks to host, but he says "im avaibale to host" and then he acts like he will be hosting a server even though all servers are taken, or the smallest server has like 3 people in it


[21-Jul-20 08:58 PM] courtney#5125
i mean personally it just bugs me that he says "I'm available to host." like


[21-Jul-20 08:58 PM] courtney#5125
idk


[21-Jul-20 08:58 PM] courtney#5125

hmmmm alright!


[21-Jul-20 09:04 PM] ethan;#0003
but omer saying "Im available to host" and assuming he is SET to host just because he asked kinda annoys me


[21-Jul-20 09:04 PM] courtney#5125
yeah exactly..


[21-Jul-20 09:04 PM] ethan;#0003

[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
No but it was CLOSE


[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
She didn‚Äôt hit anyone


[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] bman#0435

[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Thank GOD


[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
It could‚Äôve been so much worse


[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[21-Jul-20 10:24 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

One of the scariest moments ever


[21-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
She could‚Äôve hit a pole and it could‚Äôve come crashing down on my car with the whole fam inside of it


[21-Jul-20 10:25 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Or we could‚Äôve been hit head on


[21-Jul-20 10:28 PM] bman#0435

[21-Jul-20 10:28 PM] bman#0435

[21-Jul-20 11:20 PM] courtney#5125
apparently she didnt kick 2 cbs. i think it just didnt cross her mind that she was supposed to kick them?? then she realized after that she definitely should have kicked them and she felt bad for not doing it


[21-Jul-20 11:20 PM] Cam#5887
well


[21-Jul-20 11:21 PM] Cam#5887
its good that they owned up for their mistakes


[21-Jul-20 11:21 PM] courtney#5125
it sounds like she just didntd realize she had to kick them, im not sure


[21-Jul-20 11:21 PM] Cam#5887
just let her know that she's supposed to kick em always no matter what


[21-Jul-20 11:21 PM] courtney#5125

[21-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Cam#5887

[21-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Cam#5887

[21-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Cam#5887

[21-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Cam#5887

quick question


[22-Jul-20 07:19 AM] courtney#5125
why is omer still cuffing trollers/cbs/spammers etc instead of kicking them


[22-Jul-20 07:19 AM] courtney#5125
i mean he has commands for a reason, i just dont understand why he cuffs them instead :/


[22-Jul-20 07:20 AM] xM_inn#2821
Didn't we tell people not to do that


[22-Jul-20 07:20 AM] courtney#5125
yeah, but did that just go for training sessions or was that for the hotel too?

Kenzi is going to be banned again from the Discord server, less than a month ago she lied during the investigation involving Lauren and was generally uncooperative, also tried to protect Lauren from being blacklisted. Her general vibe isn't very nice to be around and way more time is needed based on her original offenses and then her actions displayed after being banned as well. Don't appeal until at least September. Any objections? Banning in around the next 15-20 minutes.


[22-Jul-20 09:41 AM] courtney#5125
no objections to that


[22-Jul-20 09:46 AM] stacey#1000

[22-Jul-20 02:18 PM] courtney#5125
@bman yeah but he could easily view the person and kick. cuffing just slows down the process & is just unnecessary when you have easy access to your commands
:/ I just don‚Äôt see a huge reason as to why he needs to use cuffs


[22-Jul-20 02:26 PM] courtney#5125
it‚Äôs not allowed at training when cbs join, so I personally think the rule should apply at the hotel too. Mrs have commands, and they should be utilized properly


[22-Jul-20 02:27 PM] babymariobebe#7563

[22-Jul-20 02:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
thats a CB


[22-Jul-20 02:45 PM] Beartikal#9760
DQAF is a CB


[22-Jul-20 02:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
actually its the exploiting one


[22-Jul-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
he crashes every gamenight


[22-Jul-20 02:46 PM] Polk#1596
its impossible to host a gamenight because they somehow always get in


[22-Jul-20 02:46 PM] Beartikal#9760
"decaf" = "DQAF" read them outloud they sound the same as well

[22-Jul-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
and also because i love envtops


[22-Jul-20 02:54 PM] bman#0435

[22-Jul-20 03:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
1. be toxic

2. download crash exploits

3. be able to make over 1000 alts

4. be able to annoy people

5. have no life and the ability to troll 24/7


[22-Jul-20 03:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
also ur gamenights will be crashed if its a LR gamenight


[22-Jul-20 03:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
if its just MRs its much less likely


[22-Jul-20 03:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[22-Jul-20 03:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[22-Jul-20 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
Yep. I took note of every single MR in that server and even prevented an LR from getting promoted to rank 9 because she‚Äôs very friendly with CBs and also in a raid server. No thanks don‚Äôt want her on the MR team.

[23-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Cam#5887
Do you see anything in common with the proof I just sent with your proof?


[23-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
Because the only thing that I see in common is the fact that they are both saying someone is leaking.


[23-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Tattoblue#5828
it might be the same person that was leaking from then and now but idk


[23-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Tattoblue#5828
we're able to narrow it down to managers if that person wasnt lyinggg


[23-Jul-20 09:00 PM] Cam#5887
True.


[23-Jul-20 09:00 PM] Cam#5887

[23-Jul-20 09:03 PM] Cam#5887
Definitely a CB


[23-Jul-20 09:04 PM] Cam#5887
thats the worst thing as well, when we get these reports and no names are mentioned, we get stumped


[23-Jul-20 09:04 PM] Cam#5887
and of course they wont say their names


[23-Jul-20 09:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
i mean i dont even see this as worthy of investigation


[23-Jul-20 09:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
if theres no proof of [accused] mr leaking then theres nothing to investigate


[23-Jul-20 09:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
i could easily create a new account and whisper to MRs that i have leads


[23-Jul-20 09:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
and id be bluffing


[23-Jul-20 09:06 PM] Beartikal#9760

[23-Jul-20 09:06 PM] Cam#5887
exactly


[23-Jul-20 09:06 PM] Cam#5887
thats our issue is that when we dont have a suspect, we cant do anything


[23-Jul-20 09:06 PM] Cam#5887
which, obviously, makes sense

@High Rank if you get any reports about the scam... and they are on the discord server.. immediate ban


[23-Jul-20 10:41 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact its not your texture that lets them in the account


[23-Jul-20 10:41 PM] ethan;#0003
its that nobody knows how to get the texture


[23-Jul-20 10:41 PM] ethan;#0003
so they tell them the fake way to get it


[23-Jul-20 10:42 PM] ethan;#0003
the real way to get it is exporting your character from studio into a downloadable file


[23-Jul-20 10:42 PM] ethan;#0003
and then you get something like this

[24-Jul-20 06:38 AM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah i was about to check audit logs for its past permissions. üòì


[24-Jul-20 06:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
yeah I think they deleted it's former role rip so all permissions got adjusted


[24-Jul-20 06:40 AM] xM_inn#2821
it SHOULD be fixed now, if anyone notices anything different lmk!!

Vendom apparently bypassing the b word suppose ably two months ago.


[24-Jul-20 04:52 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, he was banned and he appealed to me after a month!


[24-Jul-20 04:53 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah..just checking. People are raiding the hotel..saying demote vedom14 and saying he told diego to cut himself or something.


[24-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Polk#1596
not really, what's up? @impact


[24-Jul-20 04:55 PM] impact#0297
I'm sending someone your way.


[24-Jul-20 04:55 PM] impact#0297
One of our employees IP leaked in another server


[24-Jul-20 04:55 PM] impact#0297
I would like you to examine the merits of the case


[24-Jul-20 04:55 PM] Polk#1596
gotcha


[24-Jul-20 04:56 PM] impact#0297
You're just a board and I know you can deal with it -- I don't have ban commands I know damn well Bonnie's doing other inappropriate things right now


[24-Jul-20 04:56 PM] Polk#1596
LOL


[24-Jul-20 04:57 PM] Polk#1596
yeah you're right, cant trust bonnie


[24-Jul-20 04:57 PM] Polk#1596
what's their name though?


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@ethan; That hotel is pretty nice but its too compact and has so many parts


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Ive played that one before!


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Its pretty cool though


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Could improve here and there though


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] ethan;#0003
for bad pcs its probally rlly laggy


[24-Jul-20 05:24 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I mean I do love the style though, great work on that


[24-Jul-20 05:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
but I just dont think that would appeal to wide audience, its basically a showcase so he should add some more functionality to it


[24-Jul-20 05:25 PM] babymariobebe#7563
and then it can be good


[24-Jul-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[24-Jul-20 05:25 PM] ethan;#0003
it feels more like a showcase then a rp game


[24-Jul-20 05:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563
yeah


[24-Jul-20 05:26 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Thats true


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn termination. No matter who the person is you should never dox them and expose their personal information or IP address.


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] Cam#5887
i got sent that too


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
She should‚Äôve known better too. I say immediate termination.


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
I agree, but I would like to question Sarah about it first as well


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] Cam#5887
and yeah i agree with termination


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's hear her side


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] Cam#5887
true


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
She still admitted to it though :)))


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
But she'll be suspended while she's questioned


[24-Jul-20 05:35 PM] Polk#1596
i would confront sarah before doing anything and start off with making it clear that she admitted to it, but we want to know more


[24-Jul-20 05:36 PM] Polk#1596
like how she got the ip address


[24-Jul-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
Kk you can question but either way I vote termination.


[24-Jul-20 05:36 PM] katie#0200
Yeah we should question her about it


[24-Jul-20 05:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'll question her soon


[24-Jul-20 05:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
She'll be suspended pending investigation


[24-Jul-20 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
Kk


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
this was already reported to me and im looking into it @katie


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
hold on


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887

[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
im about to question her


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
they can‚Äôt see the channel history


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
so they don‚Äôt know, someone could‚Äôve reported to them both


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
but the evidence has the same background


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] ethan;#0003
@katie it might not be stolen, the person could of DM'ed her the report and also posted the report not knowing that the MR would also post the report


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
yes


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Polk#1596
thats why im going to ask her about it


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
true, this happened to me before


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] katie#0200
true


[24-Jul-20 05:38 PM] Cam#5887
this has happened to me before

@High Rank sorry for the ping, but with these screenshots in mind, does anyone think something is missing or if something seems off? if not, i'll terminate and blacklist whxala for not only impersonation, but also for ip grabbing & sharing it


[24-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Polk#1596
because it clearly looks like whxala is the person behind the fake candy account


[24-Jul-20 06:24 PM] Cam#5887
i don‚Äôt see anything that seems off tbh


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
yeah it seems pretty crystal clear to me, especially when you look at their dms and they go like


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Cam#5887
definitely does


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
"We been good friends, I didn't want it to end like this"


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
and venom also says they have had fights recently


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
and if candy sent him a friend request personally


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
it seems targetted


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Polk#1596
but i'll leave this here for like another 20 minutes or so just in case


[24-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Cam#5887
without a doubt


[24-Jul-20 06:32 PM] Polk#1596

@Polk whala is in the cb server and seems to trash talk a lot and is quite good friends with cbs. Add that to the reason to blacklist.

[24-Jul-20 07:08 PM] Polk#1596

[24-Jul-20 07:08 PM] Polk#1596
who is behind all of this


[24-Jul-20 07:09 PM] Polk#1596
but i dont think it was related to this


[24-Jul-20 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
A bunch of the cbs left the server


[24-Jul-20 07:09 PM] stacey#1000
And they are all trying to blame vedom for it


[24-Jul-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
But as for who is behind impersonating I got no clue


[24-Jul-20 07:11 PM] stacey#1000
There was impersonators before I‚Äôll say that


[24-Jul-20 07:11 PM] Polk#1596
hm, okay


[24-Jul-20 07:11 PM] Polk#1596
what we learned from this is that mew is super


[24-Jul-20 07:11 PM] Polk#1596
super


[24-Jul-20 07:11 PM] Polk#1596

[24-Jul-20 07:11 PM] stacey#1000
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she is the mr that is leaking


[24-Jul-20 07:12 PM] Polk#1596
and that someone grabbed venoms ip address btu we are unable to find out who it really is


[24-Jul-20 07:12 PM] stacey#1000
Like why joke around about saying what your cb name would be?


[24-Jul-20 07:12 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i dont really like that


[24-Jul-20 07:12 PM] Polk#1596
definitely something we need to look into


[24-Jul-20 07:12 PM] Polk#1596
has she done anything before this


[24-Jul-20 07:13 PM] stacey#1000
Not really


[24-Jul-20 07:13 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Jul-20 07:13 PM] stacey#1000

seems like whxala might get off the hook... this is super confusing, but tbh it just seems like whxale is a young person who did a few stupid things without thinking


[24-Jul-20 07:21 PM] Polk#1596
as he said he posted the ip address of venom because he wanted to show everyone "how stupid the leaker was"

All the stuff I find concerning regarding xxmewtimes


[24-Jul-20 07:23 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk ask whala to explain his trash talking in the cb server he recently left then :))


[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
He can get blacklisted alone for that


[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
I for real think he‚Äôs bs you to try to get off the hook


[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
what trashtalking did he do


[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
He talked crap about vedom a lot and I can‚Äôt get proper proof since he left rn server


[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] Polk#1596

[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] Polk#1596

[24-Jul-20 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
He left the cb server


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
But trust me


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000
He took place in it


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
before asking him


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
ive been made aware that they have been in fights


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
a lot


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
but they forgave each other now recently


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
reacted to this n stuff


[24-Jul-20 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
so i'm not sure


[24-Jul-20 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I can‚Äôt find all his chat history


[24-Jul-20 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
But I know he had taken place in trash talking vedom and encouraging the behaviour.


[24-Jul-20 07:31 PM] stacey#1000
The ones who actually doxxed him was DQAF and funt


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
for real?


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
so it was funt


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
ok so


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
DQAF sent photos of what vedom looked like


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
whaxla is off the hook


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
And so did funt


[24-Jul-20 07:32 PM] Polk#1596
right?


[24-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Polk#1596
oh


[24-Jul-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
DQAF got his photos off of YouTube


[24-Jul-20 07:33 PM] Polk#1596
what about the IP address stuff


[24-Jul-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
As for his IP


[24-Jul-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Jul-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think it was anyone in the cb server


[24-Jul-20 07:37 PM] stacey#1000
Because they don‚Äôt support it either


[24-Jul-20 07:38 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs all I got @Polk


[24-Jul-20 07:38 PM] Polk#1596
bruh


[24-Jul-20 07:38 PM] Polk#1596
they're announcing all of that because whxala is a suspect


[24-Jul-20 07:38 PM] stacey#1000
If whala didn‚Äôt Intentionally find it he somehow did from someone


[24-Jul-20 07:38 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] Polk#1596
its so hard to understand him


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
So either he tells you who did it or he gets blacklisted


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] Polk#1596
but he basically said


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
I think he is bs you


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] Polk#1596
someone in the bloxton server sent it, he screenshoted the information ITSELF, then he doesnt know who sent it


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] Polk#1596
but


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
He leaked his ip still either way= bye bye

[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] Polk#1596
the thing on the top


[24-Jul-20 07:39 PM] Polk#1596
shows that he pressed on it


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
like on an image that was sent in a chat


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
then he screenshotted it


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
He still shared it again though


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
very true


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
There is literally no excuse for his actions


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
he is basically stupid


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
but you know what


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
He is literally just saying anything he can to save himself


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
venom is aware of this


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
i will ask venom


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
if he wants to let it slide or not


[24-Jul-20 07:40 PM] Polk#1596
because thats really up to venom


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] Polk#1596
don't you agree?


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think someone getting banned should be up to vedom-


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] Polk#1596
it is vedoms information


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] Polk#1596
if he gives consent


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
That doesn‚Äôt change what he did was wrong


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] Polk#1596
its not doxxing


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] Polk#1596
yes i know


[24-Jul-20 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
I doubt vedom would be okay with it


[24-Jul-20 07:42 PM] stacey#1000
Considering he wasn‚Äôt ok with people exposing his face


[24-Jul-20 07:42 PM] Polk#1596
well yeah i hope that is his answer


[24-Jul-20 07:42 PM] Polk#1596
i will ask him


[24-Jul-20 07:42 PM] stacey#1000

[24-Jul-20 08:25 PM] Polk#1596
yes, he got his private information by someone and shared it, but he claims it was an accident and venom does not want him to face any consequences

[25-Jul-20 12:06 PM] courtney#5125
this week i worked on doing applications, sessions, and updating the training guides with anna to fit with the new update. next week i plan on pretty much doing the same thing with sessions, applications, and tickets! UMMM last fast food place i ate at was dunkin donuts


[25-Jul-20 12:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
this week ive tried to host more than i did last week which rn thats not on track to happening lol and last week i tried to do applications, trainings, some co-hosting etc. 

last thing i had to eat was Sonic lmao


[25-Jul-20 12:07 PM] anna#0004
This week and last week I have reviewed tickets and ranked passed applications. Along with that, I've managed to host sessions each day and have responded to a few MR calls whenever I've been able to. At some point during this week, I cleared suspension/demotion requests when they had gotten to quite a high amount and concluded some overdue suspensions etc.


[25-Jul-20 12:07 PM] anna#0004
And um fast food idk i don't really have it ew


[25-Jul-20 12:07 PM] anna#0004
LOL


[25-Jul-20 12:07 PM] stacey#1000
I worked at hosting more sessions around the same time in the evenings to have a better schedule for myself when it comes to hosting this week. I also looked more into the CBs to get more information regarding them and people wanting to raid the group, etc.


[25-Jul-20 12:07 PM] Polk#1596
im poolkinolk and last week i hsoted sessions and gamenights i think, and this week ive been doing seessions and gamenights (attempted to at least bc stupid exploiters raiding them) and im hsoting a mass shift today. i live in  norawy so i dont have a fast food joint right outside my house like everyone else does

[25-Jul-20 12:09 PM] courtney#5125
well not much has changed from it, we've been updating things and making it look better, sound better, etc. and we added in stuff regarding ocean bungalows. not sure if anna has anything else to add!


[25-Jul-20 12:09 PM] anna#0004
We've changed up the rules for security that you announced and recently added the new command for the ocean bungalow


[25-Jul-20 12:09 PM] anna#0004

[25-Jul-20 12:09 PM] courtney#5125

[25-Jul-20 12:10 PM] Cam#5887
yeah it is dead


[25-Jul-20 12:10 PM] anna#0004
it's fine, its a little dead


[25-Jul-20 12:10 PM] anna#0004
LOL


[25-Jul-20 12:10 PM] Cam#5887
but


[25-Jul-20 12:10 PM] Polk#1596
its like the nitro lounge, not used much and its nice and quiet


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Cam#5887
yeah, former HRs are just chillin and talkin


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Its üí§


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
probably not quiet


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Cam#5887
nah i dont think so, i believe it is gonna be crazy


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And dry


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
maybe fights between good and bad mrs


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
tbh idk i feel like the formers like talking in generak discussion too


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
general*


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
i mean formers


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] anna#0004
quieter than like general discussion but defo more active than the hr chat


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] stacey#1000
There is a lot more former MRs than HRs


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] anna#0004
former hr*


[25-Jul-20 12:11 PM] Polk#1596
some of them always cause drama


[25-Jul-20 12:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
true


[25-Jul-20 12:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[25-Jul-20 12:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LMAOOO


[25-Jul-20 12:13 PM] courtney#5125
lrs are definitely drawn to mrs and hrs, and theyre just as drawn to FORMER mrs and hrs. so they can cause a lot of activity when theyre in the chat, not to mention we just have an active chat anyways


[25-Jul-20 12:13 PM] anna#0004
realistically the former mrs do make general more active and if we made former mr chat then general would be more quiet


[25-Jul-20 12:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
10 messages in queue but the subject changed 20 times


[25-Jul-20 12:14 PM] Polk#1596
i dont really support a former MR chat anyway because it's more to moderate and we already know rules are gonna be broken


[25-Jul-20 12:14 PM] Cam#5887
the thing is, former MRs cause issues a lot in general chat... who the hell knows whats going to happen in their OWN chat


[25-Jul-20 12:14 PM] Cam#5887
dunno


[25-Jul-20 12:14 PM] Polk#1596
they will


[25-Jul-20 12:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
i like general discussion because we have a lot less rule violations compared to other smaller servers


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] Polk#1596
i mean yeah


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
no


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] Cam#5887
no


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] stacey#1000
No


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] anna#0004
no


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] courtney#5125
no


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
No


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] Polk#1596
no


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
X


[25-Jul-20 12:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
no


[25-Jul-20 12:16 PM] Polk#1596
oh god


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] Polk#1596
i agree with u, theres literally 10 servers available at a time


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] anna#0004
theres like 0 point in that-


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] Polk#1596
and the servers dies after a while


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
There is always a lot of servers so-


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah too much work


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] Cam#5887
yeah no appeal system, plus its just a server ban, they can legit join another server so like.....


[25-Jul-20 12:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
^


[25-Jul-20 12:20 PM] Polk#1596
my dinner is ready brb real quick


[25-Jul-20 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
Plus why would they want to appeal for one server. Appeals are for appealing a permanent ban, not a server ban.


[25-Jul-20 12:20 PM] courtney#5125
yeah agreeeed with what others are saying


[25-Jul-20 12:20 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Prob work


[25-Jul-20 12:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

@impact sorry im late


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
would mrs know they're being tracked at the hotel or just us


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
like getting baby and bear involved to create a system for it?


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
or how would we know


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
We already track how long managers and seniors are at the hotel so it would just be needed for heads then


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
that


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
would indeed be very very nice


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Cam#5887
it sounds like a good idea


[25-Jul-20 12:26 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[25-Jul-20 12:27 PM] ethan;#0003
other groupsi have systems where they have a dsicord bot linked to the game where they put in a command and it tells how many hours a user was at the game for


[25-Jul-20 12:27 PM] anna#0004
yeah i dont have a problem with that


[25-Jul-20 12:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah cause like venti they have system where they know how long their workers have been at cafe


[25-Jul-20 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
It sounds like a good idea


[25-Jul-20 12:27 PM] Polk#1596
especially if it worked with lrs


[25-Jul-20 12:27 PM] Cam#5887
omgggg a clock-in and clock-out button


[25-Jul-20 12:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk i feel like people are gonna think they deserve a promotion


[25-Jul-20 12:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Based off their time


[25-Jul-20 12:28 PM] Polk#1596
we could always go on alts to test them


[25-Jul-20 12:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And they are gonna get like angry just becAuse they got 1000+ time and still a lr


[25-Jul-20 12:29 PM] Polk#1596
well we already promote people without knowing how often they work at the hotel unless we see them there personally ourselves, so i think we can work with ur opinion on it


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i think if we implement it for mrs it would probably work better cause i see some of you guys talking about lrs but we have like 500+ people at the hotel every day and idk how much of that is staff but idk lol


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
i got no mic :)


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] courtney#5125
well we'd also look at their report history if theyre in the discord, we could easily either go on alts like polk said, and we could still utilize the promotion suggestions from seniors and managers, since theyre at the hotel and are suggesting them because of their work ethic


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] Polk#1596
bonnie voice reveal?!


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] courtney#5125
so it shouldnt be based just off of time at the hotel, we can get input from our mrs that suggest them


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
hmmmmmm no polk


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i heard that bonnie recently voice revealed to an mr üëÄ


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes


[25-Jul-20 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
i would LOVE to really but no mic


[25-Jul-20 12:31 PM] anna#0004
i agree with what candy and polk said

iiiiii dont think so


[25-Jul-20 12:36 PM] anna#0004
ok soo i know that recently, some managers were confused about whether they could warn heads or not and ive heard differently as well regarding that


[25-Jul-20 12:36 PM] anna#0004
using dyno^


[25-Jul-20 12:36 PM] anna#0004
are managers allowed to warn heads using dyno


[25-Jul-20 12:37 PM] ethan;#0003
a manager warned bman once with dyno


[25-Jul-20 12:37 PM] Polk#1596
i dont really see the case where they would do that, because if they do something bad we would usually appreciate if they were reported to an HR


[25-Jul-20 12:37 PM] Cam#5887
yeah thats what i was gonna say polk


[25-Jul-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
im in the middle on this one. yes it should be used if its the wrong format but they could always remind them in staff lounge so idk


[25-Jul-20 12:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
fine either way


[25-Jul-20 12:37 PM] Cam#5887

[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] stacey#1000

[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] Polk#1596
that god damn cb server and their community


[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] Cam#5887
report their discord server to discord due to harassment!


[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] Cam#5887
jk


[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] ethan;#0003
get them ip banned off roblox


[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] courtney#5125
i mean can i also mention that ive gotten countless dms and reports of mrs/lrs harrassing cbs, and cbs doing the exact same thing back


[25-Jul-20 12:41 PM] Polk#1596
LOL


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
vpn


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
So I am in the CB server on an alt and they talk really disrespectful about the HR team and yeah, they seem to want to cb rule removed so now I‚Äôm thinking not to remove it like I wanted before


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] courtney#5125
idk how we can fix that tho, but mrs and lrs are not showing professionalism or even general kindness


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i mean idk is there anything we can do other than we do now lol.


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] stacey#1000
My main issue is the MRs encouraging them


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] Polk#1596
i agree bloo


[25-Jul-20 12:42 PM] ethan;#0003
we can make it mandatory for before interview sessions for the senior host or the hr host to check and make sure there is nobody in the server trying to get mod who isnt an mr


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] Polk#1596
we cant truly make them stop unless they stop themselves


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
Like the MRs in the cb server that is friends with them


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] ethan;#0003
they have a fetish for getting bannedf


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
CBs who ruin the gamenights are the worst üôÑ


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
omg fr


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] Polk#1596
ikr


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] anna#0004
if they like getting banned then maybe we should just get rid of their title and handle them as regular trollers


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] Polk#1596
annoys me so much


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
I stopped hosting gamenights because of it


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] stacey#1000
They are literally having their own CB awards ceremony...


[25-Jul-20 12:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah i think we should just ban anyone that does wrong as soon as they enter the game


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] ethan;#0003
only at interviews


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] stacey#1000
They get banned right away usually


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] Polk#1596
i mean i dont know every CB anymore so not really


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i normally go off age but yeah i wait for them to like do their stupid spamming or bypassing


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] anna#0004
i check their chatlogs and at interviews they literally always whisper to someone else saying like "im roxie" and then i ban


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] stacey#1000
There is too many CBs to keep track of them


[25-Jul-20 12:44 PM] courtney#5125
i ban as soon as i know its a cb and who it is


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] ethan;#0003
now there is an cb starting to exploit


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] Polk#1596
i mean yeah i love to instantly ban them when i know their next username when they keep joining with "aime3" then "aime4" but its so many "cbs" at this point


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] ethan;#0003
they are now lag switching interviews


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] Cam#5887
the damn lag switching


[25-Jul-20 12:45 PM] Cam#5887
i cant stand it


[25-Jul-20 12:46 PM] ethan;#0003
the thing is the mrs dont know that there are multaple people on the roblox platform name aime


[25-Jul-20 12:46 PM] ethan;#0003
they request bans for real people who just happen to have a similar username to a cb like "aime"


[25-Jul-20 12:46 PM] courtney#5125
yeah lrs and mrs clearly arent aware of whos a cb or whos not. someone who has a low account age and no robux is a cb to them


[25-Jul-20 12:46 PM] stacey#1000
The MRs in their discord server


[25-Jul-20 12:46 PM] stacey#1000
Here I‚Äôll send you an example


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Cam#5887
definitely, idk why they are even IN the server


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] ethan;#0003
mrs in the discord should be strongly encouraged to leave


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Cam#5887
mandatory to leave


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Polk#1596
yes please


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] courtney#5125
whether they talk in it or not, they need to leave


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] anna#0004
they have no reason to be in it lol


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Polk#1596
we already have stacey in it on an alt to directly report to us anything suspicious or something like that


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
and if they refuse we remove them from their mr position right


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] stacey#1000
So this is the MR, xxmewtimes. She is one of the few MRs in the discord CB server and she legit says ‚Äúif I was a CB, my name would be this....‚Äù

[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] ethan;#0003
some mrs thing they are hrs and think they need to know everythiung


[25-Jul-20 12:47 PM] Polk#1596
so we dont need mrs to observe it for us


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] ethan;#0003
so they join the cb server thinking they are helping


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] Polk#1596
yep mew is a good example


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] stacey#1000
MRs shouldn‚Äôt be in the CB server period


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey xxmew is one of the mrs who thinks they need to know everything


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] courtney#5125
yeah theres absolutely no reason for them to be in it. whether they think theyre being helpful or not, theyre just giving cbs the attention they feed off of and encouraging them to keep doing it bc they get attention from mrs


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] Polk#1596
she also contributed to the hate for venom in it


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] Cam#5887
i believe we do yeah


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] Polk#1596
i mean yeah


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] Cam#5887
not gonna lie i mean


[25-Jul-20 12:48 PM] anna#0004

[25-Jul-20 12:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
he was on de pride too


[25-Jul-20 12:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
i hit him with my stick :)


[25-Jul-20 12:49 PM] stacey#1000
The CBs spread more hate to the MRs that are not ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with them


[25-Jul-20 12:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Lol i was joined ur game bonnie and i was oh vedoms here


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
a good definition would be a server having ranks such as like


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
lol


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
"king cb" "popular cb"


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
they literally make communities like that


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] ethan;#0003
cb server = a bunch of low life 13 year olds who shit them self over getting banned


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596
they make channels dedicated to bloxton hate


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] Cam#5887
bahahah ethan


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] Polk#1596

They change their roles all the time


[25-Jul-20 12:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Server dedicated to raiding, trolling, and spreading hate twords bloxton hotels and its staff


[25-Jul-20 12:51 PM] courtney#5125
thats a perfect definition


[25-Jul-20 12:51 PM] stacey#1000
A server that also trash talks people at Bloxton.


[25-Jul-20 12:51 PM] courtney#5125
and now we have what are supposed to be trusted mrs in that server

[25-Jul-20 12:52 PM] Polk#1596
probably hosting gamenights like "let's raid our favorite game, bloxton hotels! spread out to all servers!"


[25-Jul-20 12:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053
They prob exploit their own game nights

Btw if anyone else gets reports regarding Vac, let me know. The cbs are trying to get ‚Äúproof‚Äù to get him fired or suspended rn.


[25-Jul-20 01:14 PM] anna#0004
lol ya they already tried w me


[25-Jul-20 01:14 PM] stacey#1000
They don‚Äôt like him so they want him fired for no reason


[25-Jul-20 01:15 PM] stacey#1000
They are trying the same thing with Vedom.


[25-Jul-20 01:15 PM] anna#0004

[25-Jul-20 01:16 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs in the cb server now too


[25-Jul-20 01:17 PM] stacey#1000
And I thought she quit too


[25-Jul-20 01:24 PM] anna#0004
she apparently said shes not back to troll but i already know thats what shes back for lol


[25-Jul-20 01:24 PM] anna#0004
@stacey how dont they suspect u at all in the server like do they not wonder who u r


[25-Jul-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
When I first joined the server they asked who I was yes but I told them a random friend invited me and that I was debating not working at Bloxton anymore since that acc is a rank 4 there and they fell for it, gave me the ‚ÄúBloxton staff‚Äù role and then I went offline and they never questioned it again. I never say anything in the server I just get all the info, they got no clue I‚Äôm an HR.


[25-Jul-20 01:26 PM] anna#0004
LMAOO smartt


[25-Jul-20 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
They tried asking who invited me too and I played it off by never answering and going offline and they still never asked me it again


[25-Jul-20 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
So I just get all the info :))


[25-Jul-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
And they just banned r4ses for telling people info too and they will never know it‚Äôs me

"find a management+ dumb enough for me" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[25-Jul-20 01:29 PM] stacey#1000
Yep


[25-Jul-20 01:29 PM] stacey#1000
Do they not know it‚Äôs an HR that actually appeals. Do they think we are that dumb.


[25-Jul-20 01:29 PM] stacey#1000
Now they could actually go through and ban all the suspicious accs from their server but they are too dumb for that so I can get all the info


[25-Jul-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
The best part is they have fake hr alt accs in it


[25-Jul-20 01:30 PM] stacey#1000
Like Ethan, Minn, Polk, Bman, and some people think they are the real accs


[25-Jul-20 01:30 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey what else did xxmew say in that cb server?

[25-Jul-20 01:33 PM] ethan;#0003

[25-Jul-20 01:33 PM] ethan;#0003

[25-Jul-20 01:33 PM] stacey#1000

‚ÄúIf I ever became a cb this would be my name!‚Äù


[25-Jul-20 01:34 PM] ethan;#0003
has she ever said any other hateful or negative comments towards other people in that server?


[25-Jul-20 01:34 PM] stacey#1000
No other vedom


[25-Jul-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
Only*


[25-Jul-20 01:42 PM] courtney#5125
theyre literally talking about wanting another human being to die :/


[25-Jul-20 01:42 PM] courtney#5125
and just being inappropriate and rude in general


[25-Jul-20 01:43 PM] courtney#5125
talking about wanting someone to die, encouraging cbs, being inappropriate, being rude, and talking about what theyd do as a cb :/ honestly not that much of a loss from the mr team if you ask me


[25-Jul-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
5 votes for termination ok


[25-Jul-20 01:45 PM] stacey#1000

[25-Jul-20 01:48 PM] stacey#1000
Reasoning, encouraging CBs, trash talking, and inappropriate behaviour.


[25-Jul-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
Like her saying vedom should die pretty much is really concerning alone


[25-Jul-20 01:49 PM] Cam#5887
thats a death threat


[25-Jul-20 01:49 PM] Cam#5887
big no


[25-Jul-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
The thing I disliked the most was her saying what her cb name would be


[25-Jul-20 01:49 PM] Cam#5887

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as 8 | Head of Security at Bloxton Hotels as of 1:49 PM CST on July 25th, 2020. The reasoning behind your termination is due to encouraging CBs, trash talking, and behaving inappropriately. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Best regards,

ccandvy
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

alright!


[25-Jul-20 01:53 PM] courtney#5125
so


[25-Jul-20 01:53 PM] courtney#5125
in what order do i need to do things?


[25-Jul-20 01:53 PM] courtney#5125
when do i rank her, when do i send the letter, when do i do the announcement to mrs


[25-Jul-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
The first thing you do is fire her and update her roles on the discord


[25-Jul-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Then you send her the message


[25-Jul-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
Then you announce to other MRs


[25-Jul-20 01:54 PM] courtney#5125
alright, and what should the reasoning be when i tell the mrs? encouraging cbs, trash talking, and being inappropriate?


[25-Jul-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Then you put a card on the HR board


[25-Jul-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000
Yes as the MRs don‚Äôt need to know the full details of it being from the CB server; etc. Also make sure to put leaking this announcement to none MRs will result in consequences


[25-Jul-20 01:55 PM] courtney#5125
alr alr, tysm stacey!!


[25-Jul-20 01:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

:bloxton3: | **NOTICE OF TERMINATION**

Greetings MRs,

I regret to inform you all that **XxMewTimes2xX** has been terminated from their position as 8 | Head of Security here at Bloxton Hotels. The reasoning behind this individual's termination from our MR team is due to encouraging CBs, trash-talking, and behaving inappropriately. 
If you  have any questions or concerns regarding this termination, please don't hesitate to get into contact with a member of our HR team. Just as a reminder, leaking this information to anyone outside of the MR/HR team will result in your own termination from your position. Thank you for taking the time to read this announcement, have a wonderful day/night.

Best regards,

ccandvy
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

No polk is hosting a mass shift


[25-Jul-20 03:54 PM] Polk#1596

[25-Jul-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
We got a mass shift and cbs raiding because they are mad an MR got fired so now they are retaliating


[25-Jul-20 03:55 PM] stacey#1000
The funny thing is them raiding won‚Äôt change it


[25-Jul-20 03:56 PM] Cam#5887
@Hilton Founder hey guys so i think that the Hand-To GUI needs to be moved in the hotel, the leaderboard blocks it and you can't move the leaderboard anymore sorry to ping btw


[25-Jul-20 03:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
@Polk @anna polky or annie, is that at all relevant to your case concerning vedom?

[25-Jul-20 04:00 PM] Cam#5887
cause the leaderboard sadly blocks it


[25-Jul-20 04:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The problem with that is mobile, controls would get in the way there


[25-Jul-20 04:00 PM] Cam#5887
since roblox updated with it

Also I was just in the mall, while walking i saw 3 individuals went up to one of those unattended small business kiosks in the mall that be in the middle of the walk ways in the mall. It was like just phone cases and stuff. And on the outside, one of the glass mech doors was unlocked and one of the individuals opened it...so we all decided to get out before something bad happened.

[25-Jul-20 06:51 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

[25-Jul-20 06:52 PM] RAMMGaming#3022

can we specify rules for banning ppl for seniors?


[25-Jul-20 08:45 PM] courtney#5125
bc ive already had one ask me at what point do they need to ban someone and who do they need to ban?

[25-Jul-20 08:47 PM] courtney#5125
yes but can we specify it to THEM


[25-Jul-20 08:48 PM] impact#0297
basically the idea is


[25-Jul-20 08:48 PM] impact#0297
if they have to make a ban request for it... they can server ban


[25-Jul-20 08:48 PM] courtney#5125
i mean for some it might be obvious as to what they can ban for, but some might be worried abt abusing their power

[26-Jul-20 04:09 PM] courtney#5125
like i said in this chat the day we terminated mew, she really wasnt that much of a loss to the mr team bc she was only making things more difficult :facepalm:


[26-Jul-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[26-Jul-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
And you planned to promote Mara way before that


[26-Jul-20 04:09 PM] courtney#5125
yeah !!


[26-Jul-20 04:09 PM] courtney#5125
smh


[26-Jul-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
They just don‚Äôt know how the promotion system works. Sadly no matter who you promote there is always people that hate on it


[26-Jul-20 04:10 PM] courtney#5125
oh well, what can ya do


[26-Jul-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
Like when I promoted Ella they all hated on it


[26-Jul-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
But who cares they don‚Äôt decide who we promote.


[26-Jul-20 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
:))


[26-Jul-20 04:10 PM] courtney#5125
woo!!!


[26-Jul-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk I thought we were only allowed to have 2 people up at once to promote


[26-Jul-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
Like have 2 cards we join to promote


[26-Jul-20 04:13 PM] stacey#1000
So it‚Äôs more fair


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] Polk#1596
who said that


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
We had a meeting about that awhile ago


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
And all voted on it...


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] Polk#1596
well i havent promoted in a good amount of time


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] stacey#1000
And agreed on it


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] Polk#1596
but i'll add cards for others as well


[26-Jul-20 04:14 PM] Polk#1596
i just asked the managements to give me tons of suggestions and they listened


[26-Jul-20 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
Ok


[26-Jul-20 04:17 PM] Polk#1596
but hey since u were on the hr board

[26-Jul-20 04:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[26-Jul-20 04:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[26-Jul-20 04:23 PM] courtney#5125

[26-Jul-20 04:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053

Ummm promotions guides somewhere?


[26-Jul-20 04:59 PM] ethan;#0003

[26-Jul-20 04:59 PM] ethan;#0003
i just


[26-Jul-20 04:59 PM] ethan;#0003

[26-Jul-20 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
i think


[26-Jul-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
Ehh...since a senior vote is up I guess I gotta bring up my concerns with a alistelle now


[26-Jul-20 05:00 PM] ethan;#0003
she leaves sessions without telling


[26-Jul-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
From what I‚Äôve learned from the cb server


[26-Jul-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
So cbs message her right


[26-Jul-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
And she literally replies to the cbs and seems to encourage them and replies to them as if she is their bff


[26-Jul-20 05:01 PM] katie#0200
bruh


[26-Jul-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
So like example


[26-Jul-20 05:01 PM] stacey#1000
DQAF can see whisper chats somehow


[26-Jul-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
So he saw her whisper chats, takes a photo, sends it to her and she replies all happy or whatever


[26-Jul-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
And she messaged funterrible a lot too


[26-Jul-20 05:02 PM] stacey#1000
I remembered to keep that in my mind for a senior vote


[26-Jul-20 05:03 PM] katie#0200
yikes okay i had no idea


[26-Jul-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
I can‚Äôt get all the proof since the cb server like exploded and deleted their old general chat but I know I got some photos on pc somewhere of her DMs with DQAF


[26-Jul-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
Yes ik I didn‚Äôt think it was important until a senior vote was mentioned


[26-Jul-20 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
So now I‚Äôm mentioning it


[26-Jul-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
The cbs legit want her to get senior because they are like friends with her


[26-Jul-20 05:04 PM] stacey#1000
So that‚Äôs my concerns with her

#RDC2021 WHEN


[26-Jul-20 06:46 PM] courtney#5125
not only her being all buddy buddy with cbs, shes just very unprofessional in general


[26-Jul-20 06:49 PM] courtney#5125
shes very friendly with dqaf, she knows a lot abt him. for example, she knows hes british and knows he has a sister just from talking to him casually :/


[26-Jul-20 06:50 PM] courtney#5125
she doesnt talk to him just to find out what his alt's username is, she talks to him just as a friend which is interestinggggggggggggg

i've also noticed her connection with CBs, and whilst she uses it to help us out with which cbs are in our servers, shes still way too close to them id say


[26-Jul-20 06:52 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, like ngl its super helpful that shes able to find out whos a cb and who they are, but shes v v close to cbs in general

[27-Jul-20 02:01 PM] stacey#1000
They call every promotion biased no matter who promotes all because ‚Äúomg who is this person, I never see them!!‚Äù


[27-Jul-20 02:02 PM] courtney#5125
i mean, first off, being biased and promoting a couple ppl arent exactly the same thing


[27-Jul-20 02:02 PM] courtney#5125
yes if the cbs havent seen them, its automatically biased


[27-Jul-20 02:02 PM] stacey#1000
This just proves how dumb they are


[27-Jul-20 02:02 PM] courtney#5125
exactly smh

[27-Jul-20 03:46 PM] stacey#1000
Gotmestartcd is in the cb server and is like good friends with the cbs. She‚Äôs the next mr that concerns me over it. Not enough to really give her consequences for but enough to allow her to never get promoted to management.


[27-Jul-20 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
The same reason why I don‚Äôt want Marissa as senior just yet either. She‚Äôs basically good friends with cbs as well and her maturity is not the best at the moment either.


[27-Jul-20 03:48 PM] courtney#5125
Yeah, all makes sense ://


[27-Jul-20 04:41 PM] Cam#5887
damn naer bout ready to promote optimistic over discord


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
If he‚Äôs not active now and his activity dropped a lot maybe he shouldn‚Äôt be promoted now tbh idk


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
ikr


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
its a lil concerning


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
lowkey think hes on vacation


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
also


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
imag is in my fucking business which is incredibly rude


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] stacey#1000
What did she do now


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
"why ping optimistic" "huh"


[27-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Cam#5887
like


[27-Jul-20 04:45 PM] Cam#5887
gtfo of my business


[27-Jul-20 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
This is a reason why she‚Äôs not a shift manager right now lmao


[27-Jul-20 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
She always has a history of stuff like this or asking really dumb questions


[27-Jul-20 04:45 PM] courtney#5125
alex was afk at first for his promotion and she literally joined me and started telling me how to change how to promote him..............


[27-Jul-20 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
She tries to tell us how to do our jobs


[27-Jul-20 04:45 PM] stacey#1000
Smh


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887

just randomly joins and tries to change how i was doing it üò≥


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
she always attempts to boss us around


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
its just


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
a pain


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
I mean tbh she will probably never get shift manager because she still shows no signs of changing


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
true


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
she needs to focus on HER position


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] courtney#5125
is that the reason she hasnt gotten it in past shift votes?


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
she is sitting her "applications are pretty over flowed" "can you do some"?


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
im like


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] stacey#1000
She tries to tell me to host banning sessions when I legit explain I have no time for it at that moment


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
ITS UR JOB TOO


[27-Jul-20 04:46 PM] Cam#5887
WYM


[27-Jul-20 04:47 PM] stacey#1000
This is exactly why she is not an HR because she can‚Äôt even handle being a senior sometimes


[27-Jul-20 04:48 PM] courtney#5125
she seems to ask me pretty basic questions that even heads should know the answer to...................


[27-Jul-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly right


[27-Jul-20 04:48 PM] courtney#5125
she told me someone wasnt use grammar and i said well...........they fail then?


[27-Jul-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
She asks dumb questions and tries to tell us how to do our jobs :)))


[27-Jul-20 04:48 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i see that D:


[27-Jul-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Hence why no one will even nominate her for a shift vote


[27-Jul-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Tbh I thought it would be possible she would change at first and could possibly be a potential HR but she has not shown any signs of improvement for months


[27-Jul-20 04:50 PM] Cam#5887
nope


[27-Jul-20 04:50 PM] Cam#5887
this is why i will probably never nominate her unless she cahnges


[27-Jul-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even possible for her to change at this point


[27-Jul-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
:/


[27-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Cam#5887
optimistic


[27-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Cam#5887
was last online


[27-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Cam#5887
but i dont know where he was


[27-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Cam#5887
cause his joins were off


[27-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Cam#5887

[27-Jul-20 04:54 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Jul-20 06:32 PM] stacey#1000

[27-Jul-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
@katie just recently lyoo recommended someone for a promotion because they made fun of a rule and acted immature over it. I don‚Äôt find that very mature or a valid reason to suggest someone for a promotion. Also if you remember he‚Äôs been rude before in the MR discussions and that was why he was never nominated for a senior vote before


[27-Jul-20 08:00 PM] courtney#5125
my opinion isnt as focused on maturity as staceys sounded like it was, i probably couldve worded that better, sorry!! but i just dont think hes ready simply bc of his activity issues, from what ive seen. yes, hes on a notice, but even before that notice he really doesnt go to the hotel that often and tends to go to a lot more sessions. he puts up a lot of reports, but a lot of them arent his own and he definitely has a lot more comments on session logs than activity logs, so i think he could use time to balance it out. secondly, his promotion suggestion he did for kylieenoir (i think thats who it was) seemed kinda like a joke, the way he mentioned how it was funny that she made fun of a new rule.


[27-Jul-20 08:05 PM] katie#0200
kk, thank you guys!


[27-Jul-20 08:05 PM] courtney#5125
:D


[27-Jul-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
What should I tell and MR when they dm me asking about the cb document


[27-Jul-20 08:08 PM] stacey#1000
Bman is not here and I don‚Äôt own it anymore so


[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
Are we still using it or no?


[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt like updating it


[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
And I wish not to


[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôm not taking ownership back sorry


[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] stacey#1000
If someone else would like to do that they can but there is way too many cbs and I don‚Äôt think we should have a list anymore


[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
Greetings **Jz_sy**,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as **9 | Head of Services** from Bloxton Hotels as of **9:10 PM EST**. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to **being afk on multiple occasions for an extended period of time**. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude at **July 30th, 9:10 PM EASTERN** and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

**ethanx111**
**14 | Shift Manager**
Bloxton Hotels

[27-Jul-20 08:09 PM] ethan;#0003
too long


[27-Jul-20 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
Say that she was afk on multiple occasions


[27-Jul-20 08:10 PM] ethan;#0003
for an extended period of time?


[27-Jul-20 08:10 PM] anna#0004
i mean as we mentioned before, the cbs just love making their way onto the list so i dont think its a good idea to have it anyway plus we constantly get new cbs so updating it is just too much @stacey


[27-Jul-20 08:11 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm going to add a vote to remove the cb list

it needed to be said


[27-Jul-20 08:13 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; change the reason thing to this:

You have been suspended due to going afk at a session on multiple occasions without notifying the host and providing a valid reason to being afk. When you go  afk on a server please remember to notify the host, and if it‚Äôs before the session and you don‚Äôt believe you would be back in time it‚Äôs best to leave the server.


[27-Jul-20 08:13 PM] Cam#5887
he jsut wanted to argue so

How is this announcement for managers


[27-Jul-20 08:32 PM] stacey#1000
CB LIST NO LONGER TO BE UPDATED

Greetings, Managers and Seniors. 

I would like to inform you all that the CB list will NOT be updated anymore. This is because there is just too many people trying to become a CB, and it is hard to keep up with it. The list would just become longer and longer, and the HR team doesn‚Äôt really see a point to having a really long list of CBs. Not to mention, having to update the list itself creates a lot more work for the HR team. 

Going forward, the current CB list that is there will remain, but it is not going to be updated again. Please DO NOT message an HR to add someone to the list. You can continue to report someone if you believe they are a CB and the HR team can look into it, but it is better to report them for committing major offences. This could be bypassing, major spamming, etc. Majority of the time a CB joins a server, they commit one of these offences so it is best to report them for that.  Yes, you can still report them for being a CB as well, if you feel they are one or know they are one. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this announcement, feel free to message any member of the HR team. 

Best regards,
staceyvx

The video he sent is unavailable btw rip


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] Polk#1596
oh hm


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] Polk#1596
i mean like, it would make sense


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] courtney#5125
i think itd b quite risky to promote him


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] katie#0200
Oh wait there is chat box proof lol i didn‚Äôt notice that


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Cam I‚Äôm confused as to why he brought up baby and bear LOL


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] Cam#5887
ikr tatto


[27-Jul-20 08:42 PM] courtney#5125
that, along with account age doesnt provide a very comforting thought


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Cam#5887
hes giving his suspension reason out in GD


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Cam#5887
to people


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Polk#1596
but im not so sure if i trust a game with literally the most basic plate where u can char urself and the chatbox proof does not look like normal chatboxes


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] anna#0004
he just sent this to moody


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Cam#5887
he has former mr role so he can chat

BUT


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt trust that proof against Jared


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Polk#1596
low account age is indeed scary


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] courtney#5125
mew shared her termination reason to all of the cbs and he brought it up to me in-game and in questions


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] katie#0200
yes


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] courtney#5125
*she brought


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] stacey#1000
It looks fake


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Polk#1596
exactly


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Cam#5887
formers are pissed at me


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Cam#5887
fuck


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Polk#1596
wouldnt really consider the proof


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Cam#5887
GD going ape shit with the formers


[27-Jul-20 08:43 PM] Polk#1596
but would you guys promote someone with an account age of 3 months old?


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Cam#5887
depends polk


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Polk#1596
im not really sure


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Cam#5887
depends if we can trust them


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Polk#1596
we've had cbs before right


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] katie#0200
maybe we should ask him why his account age is kinda low?


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Cam#5887
and if tehy seem legit


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Cam#5887
yes we've had CBs before


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] stacey#1000
@courtney all the cbs hate you more but you are actually lucky because now they won‚Äôt go to your sessions as much to bug you so it‚Äôs actually a benefit


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] katie#0200
It could be a misunderstanding but who knows


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Polk#1596
WAIT


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Polk#1596
GUYS


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Polk#1596
I JUST LOOKED AT HIS BIO


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] courtney#5125
i would not, i think i said something in the hr chat a few weeks ago (i mightve forgot to say something) but marissa told me that there are around 4 cbs aiming to get lr accounts with robux/somewhat aesthetic names promoted


[27-Jul-20 08:44 PM] Polk#1596
"I played Roblox since 2017."


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] courtney#5125
dqaf told her that ig


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] Polk#1596
definitely something we can work with if we can find out his real account


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] katie#0200
Yeah


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] Polk#1596
but idk how to ask him without making it seem obvious LOL


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] Polk#1596
tricky


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] Cam#5887
you thought


[27-Jul-20 08:45 PM] courtney#5125
@stacey true1!!!!!!!!!


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] Polk#1596
he is friends with people with really low account ages though


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] Polk#1596
and one of them has only him as their friend


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] Polk#1596
ok you know what


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] Polk#1596
i'll give him a few months


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs not in the cb server


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] katie#0200
But hmm think about it tho, why would someone put that as their status without a reason to make others believe that he‚Äôs not sus


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] ethan;#0003
modezzle thinks he is the shit


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] ethan;#0003
putting emojis on every sentence


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] ethan;#0003
and spamming stupid videos


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] stacey#1000
....


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] stacey#1000
He is just


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] Polk#1596
then we can see whether or not he truly is dedicated to bloxton, then go from there


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] stacey#1000
Disappointing rn


[27-Jul-20 08:46 PM] Polk#1596
yep yep


[27-Jul-20 08:47 PM] katie#0200
yeah


[27-Jul-20 08:47 PM] ethan;#0003
i really HATE HATE HATE people who act like that


[27-Jul-20 08:47 PM] ethan;#0003
an lr did that to me once and dms


[27-Jul-20 08:47 PM] ethan;#0003
and i blocked them


[27-Jul-20 08:47 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk take one of the people I want to promote that‚Äôs not mia since I have 3 and you are not promoting Jared now it seems

She was a good mr


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
Resigned peacefully


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] Polk#1596
yeah exactly


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
I really don‚Äôt think she is meme...


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] Polk#1596
but the trade stuff does put me off a little


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
Like it doesn‚Äôt make sense


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i dont think so either


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] Polk#1596
so how long do u wanna put off the promotion for? @ethan;


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] ethan;#0003
no what im saying is that she could be HELPING meme get info


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] ethan;#0003
idk


[27-Jul-20 08:52 PM] courtney#5125
i talked to her abt her hat when i was waiting for the hat price to drop. she said she bought it when it was super low and she assumed it was from bots. thats her side of the story, if it counts towards anything


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
if we dont have enough evidence then we cant do anything


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] Cam#5887
so should mod's former role be taken......? hes suspended and can still speak


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] Polk#1596
i dont mind waiting but what will we wait for!


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
I really don‚Äôt see a reason to wait


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] Polk#1596
ok yeah


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] Polk#1596
remove it so he cant talk


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] Polk#1596
he is probably all like


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
We already waited over a month

mhm


[27-Jul-20 08:53 PM] courtney#5125
i personally dont think we should hold her back from that, shes never had close relations with meme, as far as i know of, and shes been very trustworthy for a while


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Polk#1596
...


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Polk#1596
how does she not see that as a warning


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] courtney#5125
shes never apologized to me for going afk, nor has she ever brought up her ipad...


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Polk#1596
ethan literally said "i dont want you to get in trouble for it"


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Cam#5887
facts


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Polk#1596
seems like she just didnt take ethan seriously..


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Cam#5887
she had it coming


[27-Jul-20 08:54 PM] Polk#1596
ok anyway ethan


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Polk#1596
if u wanna look into fxllen or like investigate the item thingies cuz idk how u do that, u can @ethan;


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
She has gone afk the entire session for me before and never DMed be about it


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Polk#1596
i wont promote her for a few days at least

[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] ethan;#0003
she still owns the hat


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Polk#1596
hm


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Polk#1596
so aub8ry was meme?


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
yup


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] stacey#1000
I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs meme


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
who stacey


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] ethan;#0003
and remember we have also suspicions that iiGrayCatii is meme


[27-Jul-20 08:55 PM] Cam#5887
fallen?


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
fxllen?


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i dont think it is meme but this does make me question whether or not they have some kind of friendship


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
but isnt fxllenleaves a nice person with a good personality?


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
oh yeah its not meme


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
fxllen isnt meme


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
yes polk


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
fxllen was a really good manager


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
She is really nice


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
im just worried that they have a close relationship


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] courtney#5125
fxllen is definitely not meme


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
never imagined her with the attitude like meme


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
yes


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
shes not meme


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
yeah


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
at least


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Cam#5887
i dont believe so


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
okok


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
We can‚Äôt hold her back for who she is friends with...


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
If it is like


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] courtney#5125
she doesnt act like meme at all and shes a former manager with no issues


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
well okay, if she turns out to be a problem


[27-Jul-20 08:56 PM] Polk#1596
we get rid of her!


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Cam#5887
yuuppp


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think we will have any issues


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Polk#1596
and if we get people leaking we can definitely think of her as a suspect, but thats all


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] courtney#5125
im personally somewhat good friends with her and she has not ever mentioned meme or being even somewhat friends with meme


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Polk#1596
just have her like


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Polk#1596
in the back of our minds


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Polk#1596
that sounds reassuring candy, i hope youre right


[27-Jul-20 08:57 PM] Polk#1596
she doesnt seem like the kind of person to be like her


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
yeah


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
im pretty sure


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
cause fallen and i


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
good friends before as well


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
we talked a lot


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
so


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] Cam#5887
i think ur all good no cap


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] courtney#5125
if trouble starts after shes promoted, she can be considered as a suspect, but theres not really any reason to hold her back now. shes really kind and has always been dedicated to her position, and, for what its worth, shes put a lot of effort into several other groups, which proves to me that shes not worried abt a promotion at bloxton


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] ethan;#0003
the only reason why i would want to hold off on that promo is becuse she might be very close friends with meme


[27-Jul-20 08:58 PM] katie#0200
@stacey jessie sent this to me, im kinda sus that she edited it just now, do you remember her saying this to you?

[27-Jul-20 09:04 PM] Polk#1596
i hope he just ends up accepting the suspension and tries to improve from it, but it isnt looking really good right now


[27-Jul-20 09:05 PM] Polk#1596
dhs!


[27-Jul-20 09:06 PM] courtney#5125
its fine if he wants to resign after the suspension, but rn it feels like hes just rushing into it, and hes going to b blacklisted if he does it


[27-Jul-20 09:08 PM] courtney#5125
did yall see that fizze now requires a mask in their games üò≥

sammymitt comes over to me at ints he is like "ethan im crying i accidently left the group when i was making it my primary and now i lost my rank"


[27-Jul-20 09:09 PM] ethan;#0003
so i ranked him back to housekeeping


[27-Jul-20 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
A mask irl is understandable but on a game...really?

i can see how it could encourage ppl to wear it in real life, but thats a little TOO much.... especially considering a lot of roblox players are probably young kids that dont need to go outside often, their parents/gaurdians do the shopping while the kids stay at home

[28-Jul-20 09:32 AM] anna#0004
Does anyone actually know if iiGrayCatii had any relation to Ava/Meme because her card on the senior board got archived for those reasons yet there was never solid proof. Shes very active and im not sure it's something we can hold her back for if there's no evidence to prove


[28-Jul-20 09:32 AM] courtney#5125
okay so here‚Äôs what I know!!


[28-Jul-20 09:34 AM] Cam#5887
spill yes


[28-Jul-20 09:36 AM] courtney#5125
from what IVE observed, graycat herself doesn‚Äôt really show any relation towards meme, it‚Äôs just the opposite. when aubr8y was found out to be meme, she put things in her bio and included how she wanted graycat to be promoted. secondly, i was playing a game a few weeks ago with bman and trey and u were able to type in someone‚Äôs username and see all of their custom outfits. bman typed in memes username, and the only outfits that showed up were memes ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù outfit, and one that was called ‚Äútwin‚Äù, which was an exact replica of iigraycat. other than that, I personally haven‚Äôt seen a huge connection graycat shows towards meme, and as far as I know it‚Äôs only been meme showing a friendship with graycat


[28-Jul-20 09:37 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[28-Jul-20 09:37 AM] Cam#5887
but... if graycat is friends with meme..


[28-Jul-20 09:37 AM] Cam#5887
then.............


[28-Jul-20 09:37 AM] Cam#5887
no beauno


[28-Jul-20 09:37 AM] Cam#5887
ya know?


[28-Jul-20 09:39 AM] anna#0004
okie, meme did include many people in her bio even bri who is a head and bri and meme are *very* close. but yeah if shes friends with meme then it wouldnt be such a good idea, ill look more into it at some point. thanks!! @courtney


[28-Jul-20 09:40 AM] Cam#5887
seems like  drizzle and erick won the senior vote after its complete


[28-Jul-20 09:40 AM] Cam#5887
woop woop~!


[28-Jul-20 09:40 AM] courtney#5125
yes, she had a lot of ppl in her bio that she wanted demoted and promoted, so that‚Äôs not a huge clue. but my main point is that graycat doesn‚Äôt talk about meme and hasn‚Äôt showed any relation with meme, memes the one showing she‚Äôs friends with meme, graycats just kinda hanging out there !


[28-Jul-20 09:40 AM] courtney#5125
ooooo!!!


[28-Jul-20 09:41 AM] courtney#5125
kinda wanted Jess to at least be one but she‚Äôs also not as experienced and old as her fellow managers, and Katie brought up a good point about how her other promotions might‚Äôve been rushed just bc she was capable of handling them


[28-Jul-20 09:41 AM] anna#0004
yeah its kind of a weird situation really, its just that shes soo active and she could actually be completely innocent and being held back from a promotion, whereas she could also be friends with meme which isnt good


[28-Jul-20 09:41 AM] anna#0004
yess erick and drizzle r so good


[28-Jul-20 09:42 AM] courtney#5125
right, that‚Äôs my opinion on it too, it could just be meme trying to ruin her chances and the innocent girl knows she just can‚Äôt do anything abt it


[28-Jul-20 09:44 AM] anna#0004
yeahh


[28-Jul-20 09:44 AM] anna#0004
we'll see, ill check up on both their accounts soon to see if theres anything noticeable

funky stuff


[28-Jul-20 01:35 PM] stacey#1000
Iigraycat had a low account age as well as if it was a new account made, and meme‚Äôs old Aubrey account was only following iigraycat. I was actually going to promote her to rank 10, I had the 5 votes but then Megan pointed it out and I stopped it. The HR team then said it was too risky to promote her because it really seems like it‚Äôs meme. Her outfit was even dressed the exact same as her old account and  another reason was because iiGraycat like never went to the hotel unless there was an MR there.


[28-Jul-20 01:37 PM] stacey#1000
She would‚Äôve been a rank 10 right now otherwise because I was about to go to the hotel and promote her before and asked Megan if she wanted to help me with a promotion and when I told her who, she told me that and I was like no thanks and announced it here where we all decided it was too big of a risk.


[28-Jul-20 01:37 PM] stacey#1000
I was so close to promoting her oml


[28-Jul-20 01:38 PM] stacey#1000
@anna ^^


[28-Jul-20 01:39 PM] anna#0004
ah okay, thanks for clearing that up!!!!


[28-Jul-20 01:39 PM] stacey#1000
Still too big of a risk I think and if anyone else wanted to try to promote her, you would have to announce it here since we decided before it was too big of a risk and you would have to get a vote on it if it‚Äôs a good idea or not.


[28-Jul-20 01:40 PM] anna#0004
got it, we wouldn't want anyone who's close with meme or even meme herself on the MR team so probably best to leave that


[28-Jul-20 01:42 PM] stacey#1000
This was only 2 months ago too where I was about to promote her

if anyone sees jv_lia at one of their sessions lmk pls.


[28-Jul-20 01:43 PM] courtney#5125
its known that aubr8y is meme, so graycat has to know its her, yet shes STILL friends with her acc


[28-Jul-20 01:43 PM] courtney#5125
ok blooooo!


[28-Jul-20 01:43 PM] anna#0004
ah alrightt


[28-Jul-20 01:43 PM] anna#0004
and okay bloo


[28-Jul-20 01:43 PM] stacey#1000
And the most concerning thing is she dressed the EXACT same as memes account.


[28-Jul-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
And memes account only followed graycat too so...


[28-Jul-20 01:44 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that‚Äôs why don‚Äôt promote her pls


[28-Jul-20 01:44 PM] anna#0004
i saw on memes main acct it says "not active on here anymore" could be that shes using the iigraycat acct or something


[28-Jul-20 01:44 PM] anna#0004
but yeah not planning on promoting her anymore


[28-Jul-20 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
I can‚Äôt believe I was actually so close to promoting her to rank 10 yikes. I‚Äôm glad I told Megan. And yeah it really seems like she switched over to iiGrayCatii account.


[28-Jul-20 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
Because meme really wants to get an MR account and leak to people.


[28-Jul-20 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
She and Ava both want to.


[28-Jul-20 01:47 PM] anna#0004
Yeah


[28-Jul-20 01:47 PM] anna#0004
Ava has stopped


[28-Jul-20 01:47 PM] anna#0004
well as far as im aware


[28-Jul-20 01:48 PM] anna#0004
after her apology she wanted to make me aware she has no more staff accts and doesnt plan on making any or continuing to be involved with bloxton so if anyone, id say its just meme now


[28-Jul-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah but Ava is still not to be trusted


[28-Jul-20 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
Omg Anna and Candy you will both get to promote someone to senior soon!!!


[28-Jul-20 01:50 PM] anna#0004
yeah id defo not fully trust her again


[28-Jul-20 01:50 PM] anna#0004
yess, i want like a cool idea for it!


[28-Jul-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
Well for sure when you promote one to senior pls tag all HRs because we all like to go since senior promotions are big.


[28-Jul-20 01:50 PM] courtney#5125

I just tagged her in staff lounge and waited for her to reply and hyped everyone up and told her she was now a senior there


[28-Jul-20 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
Because I didn‚Äôt see her at a session and just wanted her promoted


[28-Jul-20 01:52 PM] anna#0004
still cute that she had everyone hyped up for her tho in staff lounge


[28-Jul-20 01:52 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[28-Jul-20 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
You can do what Emma use to do and plan an entire theme session for them and make them come help and then promote them there but that‚Äôs a lot of work


[28-Jul-20 01:53 PM] courtney#5125

@stacey did you warn Jessie for being afk at sessions?


[28-Jul-20 07:01 PM] stacey#1000
@RAMMGaming no but she has gotten a verbal warning from Ethan before


[28-Jul-20 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
And I have spoken to her before on servers regarding the same thing


[28-Jul-20 07:08 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@ethan; when was the verbal warning.


[28-Jul-20 07:08 PM] ethan;#0003
whenever that announcement was


[28-Jul-20 07:08 PM] ethan;#0003
wait


[28-Jul-20 07:08 PM] ethan;#0003
i gave her it?


[28-Jul-20 07:08 PM] ethan;#0003
let me check


[28-Jul-20 07:09 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming i dont think it was me


[28-Jul-20 07:09 PM] ethan;#0003
the only thing i have telling her about it was 2 weeks ago i told her she needs to tell the host if she will go afk

She‚Äôs been spoken to many times about this by different HRs


[28-Jul-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve told her about it in game


[28-Jul-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
Pretty sure Bman spoke to her about it in the past


[28-Jul-20 07:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
But it‚Äôs her iPad that freezes


[28-Jul-20 07:17 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
Why wasn‚Äôt that noted in the announcement...................?


[28-Jul-20 07:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
There is a difference between being on Discord and fooling around and your device not working


[28-Jul-20 07:18 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
That should‚Äôve been made clear in the announcement


[28-Jul-20 07:25 PM] courtney#5125
she never informs anyone she goes afk and shes never told anyone thats the reason she goes afk


[28-Jul-20 07:25 PM] courtney#5125
even after she told that to ethan, she was still going afk for long periods of time without informing the host and she didnt tell them it was for her ipad


[28-Jul-20 07:38 PM] ethan;#0003
@RAMMGaming none of us believe that


[28-Jul-20 07:38 PM] ethan;#0003
she always comes back 20 minutes later


[28-Jul-20 07:38 PM] ethan;#0003
if your ipad froze for 20 minutes


[28-Jul-20 07:38 PM] ethan;#0003
you would disconnect


[28-Jul-20 07:39 PM] ethan;#0003
at interviews, she stops being afk after all the interviewees are taken

What we getting


[28-Jul-20 07:44 PM] stacey#1000
@RAMMGaming hard to make it clear in an announcement when she never informed me of it specifically and she legit goes afk and doesn‚Äôt come back until she loses connection, her iPad freezing is an excuse. If she loses connection and messages it‚Äôs fine but when she legit goes afk and doesn‚Äôt alert anyone until the session is done awhile later that‚Äôs the issue


[28-Jul-20 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
This not about her losing connection and asking to rejoin...


[28-Jul-20 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs about her legit going afk for a long period of time. Like I‚Äôve witnessed her be afk before a session starts and lose connection for being idle for so long and not even telling me about it


[28-Jul-20 07:46 PM] Polk#1596

An ideas on what I can do?


[28-Jul-20 08:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I mean we can move the logo elsewhere


[28-Jul-20 08:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
probs be better than pushing the pocket any higher (pockets on hoodies hang low)


[28-Jul-20 08:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
but ya the cut bothers me!!!


[28-Jul-20 08:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
why not move the logo to middle of the sweater @babymariobebe


[28-Jul-20 08:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
or i guess u could move the pockets up a tad bit

guys remember that when someone is rude and disrespectful they're going to be either warned, kicked, or banned. having an opinion does not mean they can trash talk bloxton.

Isn‚Äôt that a demotion?


[29-Jul-20 06:44 AM] Tattoblue#5828
wats da


[29-Jul-20 06:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
It's a rule that never has to be used often, last time used probabaly back in 2018. The rule was never removed but up to you guys @RAMMGaming @High Rank


[29-Jul-20 06:46 AM] Tattoblue#5828
if  we were to demote her  its kinda pointless to keep her suspended


[29-Jul-20 06:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
Well


[29-Jul-20 06:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
3 suspensions = demote wouldn't work then


[29-Jul-20 06:47 AM] bonnie591#0591
It would be 2 suspensions and then demote


[29-Jul-20 06:47 AM] ethan;#0003
i dont think we should


[29-Jul-20 06:47 AM] ethan;#0003
i dont think its a good idea to demote her


[29-Jul-20 06:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
How many warnings does she have


[29-Jul-20 06:48 AM] ethan;#0003
idk


[29-Jul-20 06:48 AM] bonnie591#0591
Pretty sure she has a ton


[29-Jul-20 07:25 AM] stacey#1000
Like 2-3 warnings


[29-Jul-20 07:25 AM] stacey#1000
She was warned for her behaviour at trainings I think


[29-Jul-20 07:25 AM] stacey#1000
Then she was warned for the afk thing


[29-Jul-20 07:26 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah she has 1 written warning and 1 verbal warning and now 3 suspensions....I don‚Äôt think we should terminate her yet but if she does anything else we could and we should promo blacklist her there is no way she should ever get management at this point.

@anna have you promoted amori or whatever her name is yet


[29-Jul-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
Cause uh she seems to be involved with cbs


[29-Jul-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
Not 100% sure tho


[29-Jul-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
But in the cb server this was sent


[29-Jul-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
gotmestartcd concerns me more that. Is7bel is a cb and this may be a private server but bypassing still shouldn‚Äôt be done-

[29-Jul-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
Did gotmestartcd alert anyone of this?


[29-Jul-20 10:15 AM] stacey#1000
And amovorii is there too, meaning she was in a private server with cbs


[29-Jul-20 10:15 AM] stacey#1000
If gotmestartcd didn‚Äôt report this user for bypassing this is a concern


[29-Jul-20 10:16 AM] anna#0004
oooop


[29-Jul-20 10:16 AM] anna#0004
i havent yet no


[29-Jul-20 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
Well what do you think about this?


[29-Jul-20 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
She also ignored the bypassing I think-


[29-Jul-20 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
Like I think everyone knows you shouldn‚Äôt bypass even on a private server


[29-Jul-20 10:17 AM] stacey#1000
Let me see if I can find anything else and I‚Äôm going to see if she‚Äôs in the cb server


[29-Jul-20 10:18 AM] anna#0004
it is pretty concerning that she's in a priv server with cbs, it doesnt really show too much of what she was doing there so i mean its kinda questionable


[29-Jul-20 10:18 AM] anna#0004
is she in the discord cb server? @stacey


[29-Jul-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
@anna cancel the promo


[29-Jul-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
ASAP

[29-Jul-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
She is highly involved with CBs


[29-Jul-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
She wants to get promoted to leak to CBs


[29-Jul-20 10:22 AM] anna#0004
oh yeah defo not happening, thats funny cuz i was ab to promote her earlier at training


[29-Jul-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
Omg I‚Äôm so happy I found this


[29-Jul-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
I should‚Äôve looked into this earlier I‚Äôm sorry!!!!


[29-Jul-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
I caught it just in time though


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
@anna take Zsiguka30 instead


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] anna#0004
no its all good, thank you though! that would've been a nightmare lmao


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
You can promote him when he gets 5 votes


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] anna#0004
are you sure?


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
He is not in the cb server


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] anna#0004
okie tyy, hes like always in my training


[29-Jul-20 10:23 AM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs safer


[29-Jul-20 10:24 AM] stacey#1000
He just needs 2 more votes


[29-Jul-20 10:24 AM] anna#0004
alrightyy, thanks!!


[29-Jul-20 10:25 AM] stacey#1000
Np!


[29-Jul-20 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
Omg I‚Äôm literally so happy you didn‚Äôt promote avomorii yet that would‚Äôve been a nightmare and like a termination not long after she was promoted-


[29-Jul-20 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
Yikes I need to look into the cb server more closely next time my bad


[29-Jul-20 10:29 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
@bonnie591 I sat let it slide this time, one more and she demoted.


[29-Jul-20 10:30 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
It is kinda a silly thing to demote someone over


[29-Jul-20 10:31 AM] anna#0004
ikr that would have been baddd


[29-Jul-20 10:32 AM] stacey#1000
I really have a bad feeling about gotmestartcd-


[29-Jul-20 10:32 AM] courtney#5125
same, and she‚Äôs causing a lot more trouble than she‚Äôs solving


[29-Jul-20 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
When the cb server got redone because of xxmewtimes getting fired she was like ‚Äúwhoever snitched there‚Äôs the door, I don‚Äôt like snitches‚Äù


[29-Jul-20 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
Omg she really really concerns me


[29-Jul-20 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
But the problem is idk if there is enough to take action against her yet


[29-Jul-20 10:34 AM] courtney#5125
she‚Äôs just completely on their side


[29-Jul-20 10:35 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs really the only other mr that concerns me rn regarding the cb server


[29-Jul-20 10:36 AM] anna#0004
and i bet if she was asked ab her relationship with cbs or if she knew about the cb server she would act completely clueless


[29-Jul-20 10:37 AM] stacey#1000
She admitted to me she was in the cb server and like talked to them and was friends with them when I suspended her before


[29-Jul-20 10:37 AM] stacey#1000
And I said it‚Äôs fine to be friends with them but when she is like supporting them now and ignoring bypassing at the hotel she is encouraging them at this point


[29-Jul-20 10:38 AM] stacey#1000
Like I can‚Äôt stop her from being friends with them


[29-Jul-20 10:38 AM] anna#0004
oh really, yeah theres a difference between being friends with them and encouraging them/taking their side when they're doing bad things


[29-Jul-20 10:38 AM] anna#0004
what was she suspended for?


[29-Jul-20 10:39 AM] stacey#1000
She wasn‚Äôt suspended that long ago

This wasn‚Äôt in the actual cb server btw


[29-Jul-20 10:40 AM] stacey#1000
She was suspended for this alreadh


[29-Jul-20 10:40 AM] stacey#1000
Before she actually did talk about just life with the cbs but now I‚Äôm more concerned


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
idk tbh


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
lowkey it‚Äôs a threat to our operations


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
so like...


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
i don‚Äôt like this at all


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
I really don‚Äôt trust her like...


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
me either


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
it‚Äôs a threat to our operations


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] stacey#1000
Like can we terminate her-


[29-Jul-20 10:41 AM] Cam#5887
idk


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
I really just don‚Äôt trust her


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
i don‚Äôt either


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
at all


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
She ignored bypassing at the hotel


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
And she is bffs with cbs


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
is she a CB??


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] anna#0004
ah yes i remember that, idk the fact that she was suspended for something related to cbs and yet now shes acting worse around them shows the suspension didnt make he learn from her mistakes at all


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
And was suspended for this


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
i‚Äôm not liking this


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
Let me find some more stuff on her


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
i‚Äôm sorry if u all disagree with me but i think she should be terminated


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
Brb


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
She should


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
Tbh


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
yeah


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] Cam#5887
i agree


[29-Jul-20 10:42 AM] stacey#1000
I have a gut feeling about this


[29-Jul-20 10:43 AM] Cam#5887
she really should be terminated


[29-Jul-20 10:43 AM] stacey#1000
She cannot be trusted


[29-Jul-20 10:43 AM] Cam#5887
for all we know she could be leaking rn


[29-Jul-20 10:45 AM] courtney#5125
yeah, like Anna said, she was suspended for being so close and conspiring with cbs. and the suspension clearly did absolutely nothing and she‚Äôs acting just as bad, if not worse


[29-Jul-20 10:45 AM] courtney#5125
she‚Äôs not helping the mr team and she‚Äôs a threat to our operations


[29-Jul-20 10:45 AM] Cam#5887
i just don‚Äôt like this


[29-Jul-20 10:45 AM] Cam#5887
it‚Äôs freaky cause... we send out everyone‚Äôs terminations, we have strict things for MRs only to see


[29-Jul-20 10:46 AM] Cam#5887
if people found out why MRs were terminated and some of the new things we are doing


[29-Jul-20 10:46 AM] Cam#5887
won‚Äôt be good


[29-Jul-20 10:46 AM] Cam#5887
at all


[29-Jul-20 10:51 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hey can someone slide my session that I just changed to tomorrow down a bit. can‚Äôt since I‚Äôm on mobile


[29-Jul-20 10:51 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
She most likely is the leaker.

[29-Jul-20 10:56 AM] stacey#1000
She has been on hotel private servers with them a lot


[29-Jul-20 10:56 AM] stacey#1000
And invites them to it


[29-Jul-20 10:56 AM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs like racks bff


[29-Jul-20 10:57 AM] stacey#1000
Ahhh this is triggering me


[29-Jul-20 10:57 AM] stacey#1000
I want to terminate but don‚Äôt feel there is enough to terminate her for yet ahdkdjdbdbdb


[29-Jul-20 10:57 AM] stacey#1000
Basically I‚Äôll watch her closely more and yes she never gets promoted to management


[29-Jul-20 10:58 AM] stacey#1000
If you all think there is enough to terminate let me know


[29-Jul-20 10:58 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I don‚Äôt know


[29-Jul-20 10:58 AM] stacey#1000
@Polk what did you think


[29-Jul-20 10:59 AM] stacey#1000
Do*


[29-Jul-20 10:59 AM] stacey#1000
About gotmestartcd


[29-Jul-20 10:59 AM] courtney#5125
she‚Äôs like


[29-Jul-20 10:59 AM] courtney#5125
I thought Marissa was bad


[29-Jul-20 10:59 AM] courtney#5125
nope


[29-Jul-20 10:59 AM] courtney#5125
she‚Äôs not like THAT


[29-Jul-20 11:00 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah she is worse


[29-Jul-20 11:01 AM] stacey#1000
Gotmestartcd is way worse


[29-Jul-20 11:02 AM] RAMMGaming#3022
Yeah it‚Äôs concerning. They were approach about it before, no?


[29-Jul-20 11:02 AM] stacey#1000
She was suspended like a week or two ago


[29-Jul-20 11:03 AM] stacey#1000
For this

Same thing


[29-Jul-20 11:04 AM] courtney#5125
and she clearly learned nothing, she seems to have gotten even worse


[29-Jul-20 11:05 AM] stacey#1000
She literally never reported is7bella or whatever her name is for bypassing and she was clearly on the server. Private server or not


[29-Jul-20 11:05 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm gonna wait to hear more people‚Äôs thoughts.

[29-Jul-20 11:16 AM] anna#0004

[29-Jul-20 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
She wants to try appealing


[29-Jul-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
She can‚Äôt message me my DMs are closed :))


[29-Jul-20 11:27 AM] Cam#5887
she ain‚Äôt appealing to me lol


[29-Jul-20 11:27 AM] Cam#5887
the amount of times she‚Äôs harassed me


[29-Jul-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah I don‚Äôt see any cbs ever getting appealed again tbh


[29-Jul-20 11:27 AM] stacey#1000

[29-Jul-20 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Last time I checked you can make your avatar look like what you want no matter how you look irl as long as it‚Äôs not inappropriate


[29-Jul-20 11:34 AM] Cam#5887
hahaha


[29-Jul-20 11:34 AM] Cam#5887

[29-Jul-20 11:40 AM] stacey#1000
Ikr


[29-Jul-20 11:40 AM] Cam#5887

‚Äúyou know that if u change ur skin color on an avatar u can be supporting the BLM movement right?‚Äù


[29-Jul-20 11:41 AM] stacey#1000
Your choice


[29-Jul-20 11:41 AM] Cam#5887
i‚Äôm probably going to


[29-Jul-20 11:41 AM] Cam#5887
ngl cause that seems the most professional


[29-Jul-20 11:43 AM] stacey#1000
Yes


[29-Jul-20 12:01 PM] Polk#1596
yeah that person seems super suspicious, it would be very nice if you could keep an eye on them in the cb server and stuff @stacey


[29-Jul-20 12:02 PM] Polk#1596
and for the bypassing thing, u can warn her if u want


[29-Jul-20 12:02 PM] Polk#1596
its super bias not to report ur friends


[29-Jul-20 12:02 PM] Polk#1596
like ive pbanned friends before at the hotel, we still gotta enforce rules


[29-Jul-20 12:13 PM] courtney#5125
heyyy just out of curiosity, is there any reason why bliss isn‚Äôt an honor member or did she just leave the group or smthg?


[29-Jul-20 12:19 PM] anna#0004
i think she left but not entirely sure


[29-Jul-20 12:20 PM] anna#0004
im so glad we're getting new seniors soon! ive barely had hosts all day!!


[29-Jul-20 12:27 PM] courtney#5125

[29-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Polk#1596
probably not a cb?


[29-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Polk#1596
i think i remember the username


[29-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Polk#1596
maybe he tried to get promoted but he never did


[29-Jul-20 01:10 PM] Polk#1596
so he created a new identity?


[29-Jul-20 01:11 PM] Polk#1596
maybe u could search up this username in the cb server? @stacey


[29-Jul-20 01:24 PM] courtney#5125
waitttt so can bliss have her honor member role back and be ranked to honor member on the group, or did she do something im not aware of?


[29-Jul-20 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
@Polk there is nothing against the account on the trello boards


[29-Jul-20 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk they haven‚Äôt mentioned him at all in the cb server


[29-Jul-20 02:42 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i checked that too, they seem pretty clean @ethan;


[29-Jul-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
but still, lets wait a little with the promotion


[29-Jul-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
but i still wanna promote jared


[29-Jul-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
okok ty! @stacey


[29-Jul-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
hmm, not that i recall @courtney


[29-Jul-20 02:43 PM] Polk#1596
but why would bliss accidentally leave the group lol


[29-Jul-20 02:45 PM] katie#0200
i saw bliss talking in general about how her honor member got taken


[29-Jul-20 02:57 PM] courtney#5125
sooo we weren‚Äôt informed?


[29-Jul-20 03:05 PM] katie#0200
i guess not


[29-Jul-20 03:24 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I heard nothing about it


[29-Jul-20 03:25 PM] stacey#1000
I took away xPark‚Äôs honour role for him bypassing at the hotel but never heard anything about Bliss


[29-Jul-20 03:55 PM] ethan;#0003
i think we should do what ryan said at the meeting


[29-Jul-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
try and force the mrs to leave the cb server


[29-Jul-20 03:56 PM] ethan;#0003
or idk if he wanted to make an announcement on it


[29-Jul-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
The only issue I have with that is really never have a full way of knowing if an mr is in the cb server or not


[29-Jul-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
Like my alt acc won‚Äôt survive in it forever


[29-Jul-20 04:57 PM] stacey#1000
And they could have other servers for all we know


[29-Jul-20 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll just bring up concerns with specific MRs I notice in it that I believe are a threat to operations. Hence why xxmewtimes is gone now and I‚Äôve raised my concerns for gotmestartcd


[29-Jul-20 05:00 PM] stacey#1000
LOL RACK ACTUALLY SENT AN APPEAL

Host an alliance visit and see if they come, then announce it there. I promote pip to rank 9 at SizzleBurger and it was fun it caught him off guard because they wouldn‚Äôt expect it at an alliance


[29-Jul-20 08:16 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs one idea


[29-Jul-20 08:16 PM] courtney#5125

Omg it would be great if you got both of them to go to an alliance visit and promote both there at the same time :OO


[29-Jul-20 08:18 PM] stacey#1000
That would be really unexpected


[29-Jul-20 08:18 PM] courtney#5125
i just feel like


[29-Jul-20 08:18 PM] stacey#1000

[30-Jul-20 08:41 AM] katie#0200
why do they think their appeals will get accepted


[30-Jul-20 08:41 AM] katie#0200
jwhrbtgmhn


[30-Jul-20 08:41 AM] stacey#1000
So they are blaming swan and sadder for them apparently ruining their reputation


[30-Jul-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
They ruined it the second they became a cb


[30-Jul-20 08:42 AM] stacey#1000
And they are still stupid they think swan and sadder snitched on their server. Nope that‚Äôs still me and they still haven‚Äôt caught me :))


[30-Jul-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll make sure they never get appealed in a million years


[30-Jul-20 08:43 AM] stacey#1000
Not with the trash talking they do all the time


[30-Jul-20 09:03 AM] Polk#1596
OOO damn @katie


[30-Jul-20 09:03 AM] Polk#1596
yeah you know what, maybe i will


[30-Jul-20 09:03 AM] Polk#1596
ty for telling me!


[30-Jul-20 09:14 AM] courtney#5125
it‚Äôs funny how they ACTUALLY think they‚Äôre able to appeal....


[30-Jul-20 09:15 AM] courtney#5125
like sadder and swan both quit trolling and weren‚Äôt involved in trolling and had good behavior for many months, then they appealed


[30-Jul-20 09:15 AM] courtney#5125
those cbs troll and exploit and bug everybody, then the very next day they send in an appeal


[30-Jul-20 09:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
Its hilarious how they for real think they stand a chance at appealing pfft


[30-Jul-20 09:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
Like they're dead serious hahahaha


[30-Jul-20 09:17 AM] courtney#5125
yeah omlllll LOLL


[30-Jul-20 09:21 AM] stacey#1000
Tbh I don‚Äôt think we should accept anymore appeals from cbs period and say they can never appeal....


[30-Jul-20 09:22 AM] xM_inn#2821
Agreed


[30-Jul-20 09:22 AM] xM_inn#2821

I think it should just be one straight standard rule


[30-Jul-20 09:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
Rather than double standards for different people


[30-Jul-20 09:23 AM] courtney#5125
agreed, no more allowing cbs to appeal. half of them do it as a joke anyways, and theyre only doing it because other cbs are doing it


[30-Jul-20 09:23 AM] anna#0004
yes i agree with that


[30-Jul-20 09:24 AM] stacey#1000
Cbs legit don‚Äôt deserve to get appealed. Even if they haven‚Äôt done anything for a year. They are highly disrespectful to us.


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
We should announce to managers not to accept appeals from CBs


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] katie#0200
Ya agreed


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
Honestly its simple; just dint become a CB in the first place.


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
Dont*


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] katie#0200
Mhm


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
Can I make an announcement for managers to not accept CB appeals ever and say they are not permitted to appeal.


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] katie#0200
They all made the choice to become a CB so they can deal with the consequence of no appeals


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] courtney#5125
i still think its funny how they expect respect from us when all they do is destroy the fun in the game for everybody else


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] katie#0200
Fr


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] courtney#5125
yes katie


[30-Jul-20 09:25 AM] xM_inn#2821
Wait for a few more HRs to give their opinions but then yee stacey


[30-Jul-20 09:26 AM] courtney#5125
they wanted to become a cb for some stupid reason, they can live with it


[30-Jul-20 09:26 AM] stacey#1000
It has 5 votes


[30-Jul-20 09:26 AM] anna#0004

[30-Jul-20 09:26 AM] stacey#1000

[30-Jul-20 09:26 AM] katie#0200

[30-Jul-20 09:26 AM] stacey#1000

I only have limited mobile access rn so can u deal with Sarah for me instead


[30-Jul-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
What did Sarah do


[30-Jul-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
I got no pc rn btw


[30-Jul-20 09:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
If shes heavily involved like mew then I vote term for gotme


[30-Jul-20 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why I got an inactive notice


[30-Jul-20 09:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
O


[30-Jul-20 09:27 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alr


[30-Jul-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
How do you think she‚Äôs involved tho


[30-Jul-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
Like yes I‚Äôll look into it


[30-Jul-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs in the cb server


[30-Jul-20 09:28 AM] stacey#1000
The only mr that concerns me rn is gotmestartcd with her involvement with cbs


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
Wait who? Sarah?


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
Sarah is the one who did that IP thing


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Oh


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
Look back in hr announcements


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Well I can say she‚Äôs not in the cb server or really involved highly with cbs from what I‚Äôve seen


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] xM_inn#2821
She admitted to ip stealing in gd


[30-Jul-20 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
If she admitted to it she should be terminated for that


[30-Jul-20 09:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
But I cant question her until Sunday


[30-Jul-20 09:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
Ye


[30-Jul-20 09:30 AM] xM_inn#2821
We're waiting to question tho so if u want to question then u can otherwise ill do it Sunday


[30-Jul-20 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
I can do it tomorrow maybe


[30-Jul-20 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt mind


[30-Jul-20 09:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
Alr just basically find out why she did it and any other info


[30-Jul-20 09:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
Lmk what she says then ur clear to term


[30-Jul-20 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
Ok and while you are here tell me what you think about gotmestartcd


[30-Jul-20 09:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
> If shes heavily involved like mew then I vote term for gotme
@xM_inn

[30-Jul-20 09:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
Rn


[30-Jul-20 09:32 AM] xM_inn#2821
Limited internet


[30-Jul-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
She talks to them all the time in their cb server


[30-Jul-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
The issue is I don‚Äôt think she did enough to get terminated yet


[30-Jul-20 09:32 AM] stacey#1000
She talks about life things


[30-Jul-20 09:33 AM] stacey#1000
But then also ignored the fact someone bypassed in a private server


[30-Jul-20 09:33 AM] stacey#1000
She just really worries me


[30-Jul-20 09:33 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll bring it up in the meeting on Saturday


[30-Jul-20 09:33 AM] xM_inn#2821
That is concerning for an MR


[30-Jul-20 09:33 AM] stacey#1000
And if everyone decides it‚Äôs best she‚Äôs gone then she‚Äôs gone


[30-Jul-20 09:34 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs also concerning she has the ‚Äútrusted‚Äù role in their cb server


[30-Jul-20 09:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
It's their duty to report incidents like that


[30-Jul-20 09:34 AM] courtney#5125
and dont forget that she was suspended for this behavior and its gotten worsee since then. she learned nothing


[30-Jul-20 09:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oh if she was already suspended then I say game over


[30-Jul-20 09:34 AM] xM_inn#2821
But I'll look over the proof properly later


[30-Jul-20 09:35 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm just gonna say if she does get terminated. They will know someone is still snitching from their server and it would probably be best I left it after


[30-Jul-20 09:35 AM] stacey#1000
Their server already blew up when mew got fired for it

Honestly I'm disappointed harriet became a CB again


[30-Jul-20 09:36 AM] xM_inn#2821
She seemed to have her heart so set on changing


[30-Jul-20 09:36 AM] stacey#1000
But if gotmestartcd gets fired they probably will


[30-Jul-20 09:37 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah they never truly change I guess


[30-Jul-20 09:37 AM] stacey#1000
Do you guys think I should ditch their server soon


[30-Jul-20 09:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
I was really disappointed with harriet, ngl after so many months i thought she was truly changing but ig that isnt the case


[30-Jul-20 09:37 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hmmmmm

Due to their stupidity


[30-Jul-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
How‚Äôs this


[30-Jul-20 01:28 PM] xM_inn#2821
Jokes aside just say new regulations preventing CBs from ever appealing


[30-Jul-20 01:28 PM] stacey#1000
CB APPEALS 

Greetings, Managers and Seniors. 

I would like to inform you all the HR team has decided we are NOT accepting CB ban appeals anymore.  This means, if you get a CB sending you a ban appeal, you are NOT to accept their ban appeal due to them not being permitted to appeal.  If a CB sends you a ban appeal, please inform them kindly that they are not permitted to appeal due to the actions they have done. CBs have committed major offences numerous times, trash talk and disrespect the HR team a lot, and overall are just a threat to operations at the hotel. 

For these reasons, the HR team has made it official that they can no longer appeal. If a CB wanted to be able to enjoy the hotel and appeal, they should‚Äôve never became a CB and committed multiple major offences in the first place. When you commit a major offence so many times, makes it impossible to appeal. Yes, a couple of CBs have appealed in the past, but that was months ago. Given there are a lot more CBs and a lot more trying to appeal, we have decided it‚Äôs best they are not permitted to appeal. We want to keep the hotel a safe and peaceful environment, and that means not appealing users that are a threat to operations. From now on, if you do send in a CB appeal, it will immediately be declined. Please DO NOT accept any of their appeals. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this new regulation, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask any member of the HR team. 

Best regards,
staceyvx
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels

If you have explained they can‚Äôt appeal just say this:


[30-Jul-20 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
You are not permitted to appeal, I have explained that. You threatening to go to the hotel to troll, or actually going to the hotel to troll won‚Äôt change it either. We handle trollers every day it‚Äôs not new.

Addressing the problem of CB hate
Dear any human who‚Äôs reading this,  Alright, let‚Äôs just get into the problem - CB (Circumventing Ban) hate.  Even though I know I‚Äôm a CB and my opinions/thoughts may get blocked out, just please take the time to consider everything I‚Äôve put in this letter.  Block me if you fee...

i can if u want


[30-Jul-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
Jsyk you will get a lot of hate from the cbs more


[30-Jul-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
But you will also get the bonus they won‚Äôt want to go to your sessions anymore


[30-Jul-20 02:39 PM] stacey#1000
Makes your job easier


[30-Jul-20 02:39 PM] anna#0004
i think it was just mentioned that we should get mrs to leave, idk if its an actual thing yet


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think we should make it a rule


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
As I said about that before I dislike that because we will never have a full way of knowing if they are in the cb server or not


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
Make their discord a blacklisted discord for MRS


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
My alt won‚Äôt survive in it forever


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
Eh true


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
And there could be other servers we don‚Äôt know about


[30-Jul-20 02:40 PM] stacey#1000
So we shouldn‚Äôt do that


[30-Jul-20 02:41 PM] stacey#1000
We can‚Äôt have any way of knowing what servers they are in


[30-Jul-20 02:41 PM] stacey#1000
We will talk about this at the meeting tho


[30-Jul-20 02:41 PM] stacey#1000

Greetings **gotmestartcd**,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as Rank 8 | Head of Security from Bloxton Hotels as of 8:55 pm BST, 30/07/20. The reasoning behind your termination is due to being heavily involved with CBs and fully supporting and encouraging their behaviour despite being advised not to in the past. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

annaenyii

@anna that‚Äôs good but for reasoning for termination add ignoring the fact someone bypassed and didn‚Äôt report it


[30-Jul-20 03:25 PM] anna#0004
okay!


[30-Jul-20 03:28 PM] anna#0004
@stacey should i add that in the announcement to mrs too

[30-Jul-20 03:32 PM] anna#0004
:bloxton3: | **NOTICE OF TERMINATION**

Greetings MRs, 

I regret to inform you all that **gotmestartcd** has been terminated from their position as 8 | Head of Security here at Bloxton Hotels. The reasoning behind this individual's termination from our MR team is due to encouraging and supporting CBs, whilst also disapproving of one of our newly implemented rules in order to take their side. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this termination, please don't hesitate to get into contact with a member of our HR team. Just as a reminder, leaking this information to anyone outside of the MR/HR team will result in your own termination from your position. Thank you for taking the time to read this announcement, have a wonderful day/night. 

Best regards, 

annaenyii
Shift Manager 
Bloxton Hotels


[30-Jul-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn‚Äôt say disproving of a rule we made necessarily because MRs are allowed to have their own opinions on things, but her encouraging them more by agreeing with them knowing they are spamming MRs and being immature encourages them more so


[30-Jul-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
They are attacking MRs with spam messages at this point


[30-Jul-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
In DMs


[30-Jul-20 03:34 PM] anna#0004
alright!


[30-Jul-20 03:34 PM] anna#0004
yeah


[30-Jul-20 03:34 PM] stacey#1000
So I would say something like:


[30-Jul-20 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
While ignoring and encouraging immature behaviour, being fully aware of the what CBs were doing.

[30-Jul-20 04:10 PM] ethan;#0003
they wouldnt have a public channel that anyone can view


[30-Jul-20 04:10 PM] ethan;#0003
they would need to go through a verficiation


[30-Jul-20 04:10 PM] ethan;#0003

[30-Jul-20 04:10 PM] ethan;#0003

Nobody told you...to go and get on the CB list.. Nobody forced you to go to the hotel and frequently troll.


[30-Jul-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
Nobody told them to trash talk us and dox people


[30-Jul-20 04:55 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm not trying to be mean but like if your considering suicide then you should look for some help. And its over a game..


[30-Jul-20 04:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Seems exaggerated


[30-Jul-20 05:08 PM] courtney#5125
give respect to get respect, u can‚Äôt dox people and absolutely destroy any semblance of fun from a game then expect to be treated like royalty sorry


[30-Jul-20 05:51 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; so megan had to go afk and like lost connection for being afk too long so i just ranked her passers for her so thats why there is no card

considering she was banned for encouraging a raid or smthg, i feel like she cant complain THAT much abt discord bans but hahah


[30-Jul-20 06:57 PM] courtney#5125
the people that want to use discord correctly are rewarded by being able to communicate with lrs/mrs/hrs easier. the people that dont want to use it correctly shouldnt have and dont have that benefit


[30-Jul-20 07:14 PM] courtney#5125

[30-Jul-20 10:37 PM] courtney#5125
the cbs are literally so annoying.............. they really think theyre doing something with those announcements


[30-Jul-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve stopped people from getting promoted seeing who they really are and I‚Äôve seen who some MRs really were and got them booted off the MR team :))


[30-Jul-20 10:37 PM] stacey#1000
Their whole server is like a comedy server to me


[30-Jul-20 10:37 PM] courtney#5125
i still cant get over how they expect to be treated like royalty and expect so many privileges because they ruin a kids game and do illegal things


[30-Jul-20 10:38 PM] stacey#1000
I think I made the best decision ever when I joined their server on my alt


[30-Jul-20 10:38 PM] courtney#5125
i mean it IS quite hilarious


[30-Jul-20 10:38 PM] courtney#5125

[30-Jul-20 10:38 PM] stacey#1000

- Time Tracking System for MR's (Yes/No Vote)

[31-Jul-20 07:16 AM] Polk#1596
Tatto, I must remind you that you are indeed a higher rank than her, meaning you can take this into your own hands. @Tattoblue


[31-Jul-20 07:16 AM] Polk#1596
Fire her, exile her, do whatever you must.

Ok then


[31-Jul-20 08:09 AM] stacey#1000
Hey guys apparently we got an MR right now that‚Äôs an alt account of a blacklisted user. I don‚Äôt know who it is yet but I‚Äôm looking into it. For now I‚Äôd hold off on anymore manager promotions while I try to determine which head this is or if it‚Äôs a false report.


[31-Jul-20 08:10 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey Okay, ma'am.


[31-Jul-20 08:10 AM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs supposedly the alt account of WxterDrops, someone that likes to be aesthetic and stand near plants at trainings apparently.


[31-Jul-20 08:10 AM] stacey#1000
Again idk if it‚Äôs 100% true or not but it‚Äôs something that still needs to be looked into.


[31-Jul-20 08:18 AM] stacey#1000

She quit Bloxton


[31-Jul-20 05:13 PM] courtney#5125

[31-Jul-20 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
I think it‚Äôs saying like thank you for accepting her as a cb that‚Äôs what it seems like to me


[31-Jul-20 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
She also went to the hotel and raided as her final goodbye so


[31-Jul-20 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
Or supported it


[31-Jul-20 05:14 PM] anna#0004
lol cant believe she was ab to be promoted


[31-Jul-20 05:14 PM] stacey#1000
Because all the cbs made accounts of like ‚Äúavomriibest‚Äù and raided

But I‚Äôll see


[31-Jul-20 05:18 PM] anna#0004
just try to be there for as long as u can ig, its rlly helpful but theyre gonna keep getting suspicious and just go through like everyone at some point


[31-Jul-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
They said in announcements if someone snitched again they kick all staff and purge the chat lmao


[31-Jul-20 05:19 PM] stacey#1000
I mean kicking all the staff is a bonus because they shouldn‚Äôt be in it in the first place


[31-Jul-20 05:20 PM] anna#0004
yeah thats true


[31-Jul-20 05:20 PM] anna#0004
but theyll prob somehow get back in anyway after a while


[31-Jul-20 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah true


[31-Jul-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm still in it for rn so


[31-Jul-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
And no other MRs concern me at the moment


[31-Jul-20 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
I means sillleqae is in it but hasn‚Äôt said much so I‚Äôll just keep an eye on her


[31-Jul-20 05:22 PM] anna#0004
yeah and she seems pretty scared ab being the next to get terminated but i mean if she doesnt wanna look susp then she should just leave, but yeah at least shes not saying anything


[31-Jul-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
She left the server but then rejoined it so


[31-Jul-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[31-Jul-20 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs not saying anything in it as of rn so she‚Äôs not concerning me


[31-Jul-20 05:23 PM] anna#0004
she doesnt really seem like one to encourage/support a cb


[31-Jul-20 05:23 PM] anna#0004
but then again, gotmestartcd was kinda unexpected too so u never know


[31-Jul-20 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
She hasn‚Äôt encouraged them and gotten involved a lot like mew and gotmestartcd did


[31-Jul-20 05:26 PM] anna#0004
thats good, lets just hope it stays that way!


[31-Jul-20 06:08 PM] Beartikal#9760

yes


[31-Jul-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs gone. She ignored stuff they did like bypassing at the hotel


[31-Jul-20 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
Can‚Äôt have her on the MR team. For all I know she leaked stuff to them.


[31-Jul-20 06:36 PM] anna#0004
did they make their doc yet @stacey

My response letter. -gotmestartcd.
Dear reader,  ( Most likely a Bloxton Hotels staff member or a ‚Äò‚ÄôCB‚Äô‚Äô)  My name is Gotme, also known as gotmestartcd on Roblox. As you probably have found out by now, I have been terminated from my position as Head of Security at Bloxton Hotels. In this letter I will address m...

[31-Jul-20 07:16 PM] anna#0004
she just made a whole excuse explaining why she didnt report them for bypassing and then said "and even if i did see the bypassing, i still would've not reported it"


[31-Jul-20 07:16 PM] anna#0004
makes sense


[31-Jul-20 07:18 PM] courtney#5125
i really dont see how theres even 2 sides to the story, we saw that she was encouraging cbs and clearly on their side, theres nothing more to it


[31-Jul-20 07:20 PM] anna#0004
its never gonna be a one sided story if cbs r involved


[31-Jul-20 07:20 PM] anna#0004
"Some CBs sent the MR team a document with some ideas that would make Bloxton a better place."


[31-Jul-20 07:21 PM] anna#0004
how can they even say that if they're the ones who join to ruin people's experience at bh anyway


[31-Jul-20 07:23 PM] courtney#5125
ok also hopefully cheif is gonna leave the cb server nowwww


[31-Jul-20 07:24 PM] courtney#5125
she was just asking what is allowed and whats not allowed when it comes to cbs, so i mentioned that being in a cb server can reflect poorly on someone and that id personally recommend on being in one, for starters


[31-Jul-20 07:24 PM] courtney#5125
so


[31-Jul-20 07:24 PM] courtney#5125
HOPEFULLY


[31-Jul-20 07:24 PM] courtney#5125
she leaves along with others


[31-Jul-20 07:24 PM] anna#0004
yeah ive had a few mrs ask me what encouraging a cb would mean


[31-Jul-20 07:25 PM] anna#0004
i think its better off theyre not in the server but i mean


[31-Jul-20 07:25 PM] anna#0004
up to them i guesss


[31-Jul-20 07:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[31-Jul-20 07:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
all these documents..


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] courtney#5125
"He was apparently banned and appealed for the bypassing, something that not many would achieve."


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] courtney#5125
that doesnt make SENSE tho


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] courtney#5125
bc he waited a month and then sent a decent appeal


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] courtney#5125
that happens to a lot of ppl but ok!


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Has anyone told them to earn respect you have to give respect..


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] courtney#5125
they havent figured that one out yet


[31-Jul-20 07:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
People don't see what happens behind closed doors so they assume what happens.

[31-Jul-20 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
She really doesn‚Äôt care about people bypassing in a private server?

[31-Jul-20 07:34 PM] anna#0004
its rlly funny how she made an excuse for why she didnt report it and then says if she **did** see them bypass, she still wouldnt report it


[31-Jul-20 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
Bear is not encouraging them when he has gotten information too LOL


[31-Jul-20 07:34 PM] courtney#5125

[31-Jul-20 07:34 PM] anna#0004
LOL


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] courtney#5125
she said that another mr couldve done it and makes an excuse, *but she wouldnt have reported it anyways* ii-


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] anna#0004
stacey theyre bring bear into it bc he has the trusted role and that was used as part of the evidence i showed her


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not really exactly about the roles


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] anna#0004
yeah


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs about ignoring major offences they commit


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
And encouraging them


[31-Jul-20 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
By even associating with them and talking to them daily


[31-Jul-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
Bear doesn‚Äôt talk with them in the server lol


[31-Jul-20 07:36 PM] anna#0004
ive explained many times that its not ab the trusted role


[31-Jul-20 07:36 PM] stacey#1000
I gotta read the rest of this


[31-Jul-20 07:36 PM] courtney#5125
shes so upset abt the role but that only has to do with a small part of her termination, the majority of it is just completely siding with them, telling them to come to interviews to get jobs, defending them no matter what, basically being a cb :eyeshake:


[31-Jul-20 07:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053

@courtney LOL IK i had a few of the cbs come to me asking why she got termed for the **role** like its not the role that is the issue


[31-Jul-20 07:41 PM] courtney#5125

[31-Jul-20 07:42 PM] courtney#5125

[31-Jul-20 07:42 PM] anna#0004
LMAOOO


[31-Jul-20 07:43 PM] anna#0004

[31-Jul-20 07:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[31-Jul-20 07:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[31-Jul-20 07:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[31-Jul-20 07:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[31-Jul-20 07:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[31-Jul-20 07:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
lol


[31-Jul-20 07:46 PM] anna#0004

lol ikr


[31-Jul-20 07:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but still people read it and think oh they forced her.


[31-Jul-20 07:47 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ü§¶


[31-Jul-20 07:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
like what kind of power do we have to force her out of bed at 4am


[31-Jul-20 07:49 PM] stacey#1000
Omg it‚Äôs another tea doc again for the 1000 time of someone trying to blame Bloxton for their own life choices of not doing schoolwork or having good time-management!!!


[31-Jul-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
Like if you choose to attend trainings and ignore your family that‚Äôs your own fault not Bloxtons fault


[31-Jul-20 07:50 PM] courtney#5125
like i get sometimes being on the computer is addicting, but ive realized when im on my laptop a little too much and need to log off for a bit..........


[31-Jul-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve read that in so many tea docs


[31-Jul-20 07:50 PM] anna#0004
ikr ive seen it all before "i ignored my parents **FOR BLOXTON**" "i missed my friends bday **FOR BLOXTON**" like we didnt make u.....


[31-Jul-20 07:50 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs called not having good time management. Legit this is just comedy to read


[31-Jul-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
And they really think it‚Äôs about just 1 role? Did you not explain it was about much more LMAO


[31-Jul-20 07:51 PM] courtney#5125
ive never been a huge huge huge fan of the excuse for resigning is that the person was on their electronics too much and lost all connections with friends and family and their mental health when south..... like okk...... but u can just take a break for a bit, cant yaa? if ur so set on being active, thats fine, but u should be able to realize when u  need to get off and go outside and hang out with family or smthg


[31-Jul-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
Omg that was so funny to read


[31-Jul-20 07:51 PM] stacey#1000

This is my favourite part


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] courtney#5125
its really funny bc they DONT know who u are


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] anna#0004
the amount of times ive said its not even about the trusted role and they still use it bc they need to make us look bad somehow


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] courtney#5125
bluffffffffffffffffffff


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] anna#0004
omg


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] anna#0004
LOL


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
They don‚Äôt


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
They also have no clue


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
That the entire hr team voted on this and decided it was best


[31-Jul-20 07:52 PM] courtney#5125
yeah theyre only saying it bc they dont want to reveal that... maybe... just maybe, we were right and they were wrong?


[31-Jul-20 07:53 PM] courtney#5125
ik its impossible to comprehend!


[31-Jul-20 07:53 PM] courtney#5125
@Bloo_Berriez sir bloo if u need more hosts i can host a server!


[31-Jul-20 07:53 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like yesterday during my trainings...barely any seniors on i guess..I didn't force anyone. I just told the servers they weren't getting hosted and cancelled my other two sessions for the day.


[31-Jul-20 07:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
also ima be promoting jv_lia if anyone wants to come :eyesshaking: but dont come yet. ima do a fun obby, and vac is gonna build a separate room where everyone is gonna fall in and Jv_lias name is gonna be spelled in big letters. hopefully she catches on but if u wanna come, it will be towards the end of my session!


[31-Jul-20 07:54 PM] stacey#1000

Opinions regarding the new rule
vUn1x; (Uni):    Introduction  Greetings readers, thank you for taking your time to read this document. I highly appreciate that you would like to hear my opinions regarding the new rule for ban appeals.  As you may know, I‚Äôm not a High Rank so my opinion won‚Äôt have much effec...

yayayayyayyyaay TY!


[31-Jul-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
We can discuss this cb rule thing at the meeting tomorrow. But right now the current cbs wanting to appeal proved they don‚Äôt deserve to appeal


[31-Jul-20 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
Hence why the rule was made


[31-Jul-20 07:56 PM] courtney#5125
wait stacey is that doc from the managers...?


[31-Jul-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs from uni


[31-Jul-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
1 manager


[31-Jul-20 07:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
lyoowo


[31-Jul-20 07:57 PM] anna#0004
the thing is rack, sooty, dqaf etc want to appeal when they havent shown signs of improvement whereas when swan appealed it was clear she had changed


[31-Jul-20 07:57 PM] courtney#5125
lyoo too he has a section underneath


[31-Jul-20 07:57 PM] stacey#1000
I mean yes if it was like a cb that was inactive for like 5+ months and they had like a detailed essay we could consider it


[31-Jul-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
But like even then all the cbs there are right now I wouldn‚Äôt ever appeal tbh


[31-Jul-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
Like rack, etc all proved they don‚Äôt deserve it


[31-Jul-20 07:58 PM] anna#0004
yeah exactly, but they tried appealing when they're still trolling which makes no sense


[31-Jul-20 07:58 PM] courtney#5125
yeah my issue is that, for example, lets say dqaf wanted to appeal. well, lets say dqaf exploited, bypassed, and tried to get a job yesterday and trolled. then the very next day he wakes up and says he wants to appeal bc hes changed and hes sorry............


[31-Jul-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
Exactly


[31-Jul-20 07:58 PM] stacey#1000
Even after a month I wouldn‚Äôt appeal them


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] anna#0004
dqaf tried to appeal the other day LOL


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] courtney#5125
while swan and sadder had perfect behavior for months, and even then, the hr team was probably wary to accept or even let them appeal. after months of not trolling and completely disconnecting from their cb actions, then they were allowed to appeal............


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] courtney#5125
like theres a huge difference


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I‚Äôd be willing to make changes a bit but not really


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] anna#0004
what they do is they try to appeal and when it doesn't work out theyre like ok lets continue


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] anna#0004
which just decreases their chances even more


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] courtney#5125
change quite literally doesnt happen overnight. u cant just wake up and feel bad and want to appeal. you need to wiat and take some time to show youve completely changed and learned from ur multiple mistakes...


[31-Jul-20 07:59 PM] stacey#1000
I mean after seeing what the cbs say about the HR team BEFORE they tried appealing made me very upset. I would never appeal anyone in that server


[31-Jul-20 08:00 PM] stacey#1000
In their tea doc they argue they get hated on and harassed and trash talked about, and saying rack got doxxed or whatever, but they don‚Äôt admit that‚Äôs exactly what they do


[31-Jul-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
They also make false claims against MRs and yet never reported it or showed evidence so....hard to believe that.


[31-Jul-20 08:01 PM] stacey#1000
They try to play the victim


[31-Jul-20 08:01 PM] anna#0004
i cant believe theyre playing the victims when none of this wouldve been caused if they hadnt become cbs in the first place


[31-Jul-20 08:02 PM] anna#0004
they really brought it upon themselves but dont wanna admit it so they find the smallest things to blame it on others


[31-Jul-20 08:02 PM] stacey#1000
I mean yeah I agree they are human and whatever but they lost everyone‚Äôs respect when they started harassing and doing a lot of bad things. They have a long list of things.


[31-Jul-20 08:03 PM] anna#0004
yeah defo, like obviously we wouldnt want them to go so far where they want to self harm << as they've mentioned, but we also shouldn't be held responsible for it...


[31-Jul-20 08:03 PM] stacey#1000
They blame us and don‚Äôt admit they still actively do all this stuff. They did this like not even a week before trying to appeal. And their ‚Äúno snitching‚Äù rule legit encourages others to break rules and not tell others. I mean of course I see something not right I‚Äôm gonna do my job and get them fired if they are a threat to operations.


[31-Jul-20 08:04 PM] Beartikal#9760
anybody wanna do something dumb and do like a 700 player Bloxton game or something lmaooo


[31-Jul-20 08:04 PM] stacey#1000

[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
The game would die and lag out


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
thats the largest ive seen so far


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
You need like a simple game


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
the game doesnt lag if nobody is moving


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] Beartikal#9760
RDC hit 600 lol


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
the game lags when people jump and move


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
With just a baseplate and that‚Äôs it


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] ethan;#0003
oh wow


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
Make a giant box call that a game


[31-Jul-20 08:05 PM] stacey#1000

1. we dont give u first class service because u treat us like crap, and you always have been treating us like crap 2. saying that you troll the hotel only because of "how toxic it is", don't really see how trolling is helping to fix the "toxicity" but ok 3. i have indeed seen mrs with no robux, rarely hrs because we are so committed to the point where we want to spend robux on the freaking game lmao 4. lost 2 horrible mrs sorry not sorry 5. oh ur humans too? maybe u should take ur own words into consideration when u tell people to die and harrass children in a block game 6. shut up and bye


[31-Jul-20 08:18 PM] Polk#1596

they expect us to APOLOGIZE for the chaos, work, and overall harassment they have done to us? open ur own eyes, clearly they cant understand how we have it like


[31-Jul-20 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003

[31-Jul-20 08:19 PM] ethan;#0003

golden rule: treat others how you want them to treat you


[31-Jul-20 08:20 PM] stacey#1000
1: gotmestartcd was not fired for her roles in the server. It was much more. 

2: saying you troll because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoxic‚Äù the ones making it toxic is the cbs. Plus if it‚Äôs toxic and you don‚Äôt enjoy it why are you here still 

3: wanting us to apologize for ‚Äúharnessing you‚Äù they need to learn the definition of harassment then. They are the only ones harassing us with their hate and disrespect.


[31-Jul-20 08:20 PM] courtney#5125
well if theyre tired of being treated like shit maybe they should act like less shitty people. idk just a thought!


[31-Jul-20 08:21 PM] Polk#1596
going to harass us? we are not going to be friendly to you


[31-Jul-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
Man this week has been rough with cbs


[31-Jul-20 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
I spent the whole week focusing on them


[31-Jul-20 08:21 PM] Polk#1596
yeah i swear to god


[31-Jul-20 08:22 PM] Polk#1596
they get on my nerves when they are sitting there on their high horse


[31-Jul-20 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
They play the victim when they are doing that to cover their own actions


[31-Jul-20 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not like we DM them sending them hate messages like they do for us


[31-Jul-20 08:23 PM] courtney#5125
they just act as if theyre absolutely innocent and theyve done nothing wrong


[31-Jul-20 08:23 PM] courtney#5125
uhhhhhhhhhhhh


[31-Jul-20 08:23 PM] courtney#5125
yeah no


[31-Jul-20 08:24 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll have a lot to talk about at the meeting tomorrow regarding cbs. I‚Äôve had a long week with their shit.


[31-Jul-20 08:24 PM] stacey#1000
Got 2 MRs out the door. A new rule made and stopped a promotion that would‚Äôve turned out bad


[31-Jul-20 08:24 PM] stacey#1000
My alt acc is great


[31-Jul-20 08:24 PM] stacey#1000
But it‚Äôs not fun reading what they say either


[31-Jul-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
Without being able to say anything to them back


[31-Jul-20 08:25 PM] courtney#5125
i really want to get all of the mrs out of that server as soon as possible, hope that can happen


[31-Jul-20 08:25 PM] stacey#1000
Some did leave after they saw 2 MRs were fired


[31-Jul-20 08:26 PM] courtney#5125
good, but even if theres only 1 left its still giving the cbs just another reason to keep trash-talking


[31-Jul-20 08:26 PM] courtney#5125
and another reason to just keep doing what theyve been doing tbh


[31-Jul-20 08:27 PM] stacey#1000
I need to look into who is in the server again

Is that indicating we have a leaker?

[31-Jul-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
he spammed me to put him on the cb list


[31-Jul-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003
apparently he calls himself a cb


[31-Jul-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs also under investigation right now


[31-Jul-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
There is a report he is an MR on an alt acc


[31-Jul-20 09:11 PM] courtney#5125

if u dont want to be treated like shit dont act like shit.......... BUT OK!


[31-Jul-20 09:12 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe if a bunch of them didn‚Äôt try appealing at the same time and still troll and trash talking is while doing so the rule wouldn‚Äôt have been made


[31-Jul-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe don‚Äôt become a CB and do all that shit if you wanted respect and to be a normal hotel guest


[31-Jul-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
They don‚Äôt deserve to appeal right now


[31-Jul-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
They have proven they don‚Äôt deserve it even more at this point


[31-Jul-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
yeah LOLLL they want to appeal and they put "thought" into writing it, but simultaneously continue to trash-talk and cause major problems

[31-Jul-20 09:15 PM] ethan;#0003
CB's: let us appeal, we are good people, we dont want to bring harm

also cbs: raiding interview servers, exploiting and shuting down servers, bypassing, threatening staff, harassing staff

Legit as they were waiting for their appeal results before the rule was made in their cb server they were like: 
I‚Äôm faking it right now to get appealed. They are so slow the hr team are stupid, omg why is this taking so long I‚Äôm just going to troll right now. Omg this mr sucks, who tf just got promoted, omg candy promotes everyone and should be fired for promoting bad people.


[31-Jul-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000

Talkative role gives them access to general chat and other chats. They have to make a ticket to request for the role


[31-Jul-20 11:21 PM] babymariobebe#7563
love the number


[31-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Beartikal#9760
what can thye do with just verified


[31-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Tattoblue#5828
verified is so we know what their roblox username is @Beartikal


[31-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Tattoblue#5828
they cant actually talk yet in general and other channels


[31-Jul-20 11:22 PM] stacey#1000
If their acc age on roblox and discord is not over 30 days they don‚Äôt get talkative role. That‚Äôs so raiders randomly can‚Äôt get access to general chat. Verified all you see is vericsuron channel and not everyone can see verification


[31-Jul-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
Verification*


[31-Jul-20 11:23 PM] stacey#1000
So like a raider tries to join and fails, raiding verification channel does nothing


[31-Jul-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
can we add that somewhere


[31-Jul-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
its not even in the ruels so its kinda hidden


[31-Jul-20 11:24 PM] Beartikal#9760
if i were new i wouldnt know what to do


[31-Jul-20 11:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
its in the #access-pending channel


[31-Jul-20 11:25 PM] stacey#1000
