OHHHH


[01-Jul-21 08:33 AM] Polk#1596
Shouldn't intentionally cuffing guests for no reason be major @bonnie591


[01-Jul-21 08:35 AM] Polk#1596
If they just cuff them and stand still they technically are just minor cuff abusing according to what u said


[01-Jul-21 08:36 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah if they are doing it intentionally then it can be major


[01-Jul-21 08:36 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill edit the list


[01-Jul-21 08:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
@KjRBLX i found this when i searched a blacklisted username in the trello search and i find it amusing how this was only a suspension https://trello.com/c/1eLIgUx5/6707-cukooguy-reception-kick-all


[01-Jul-21 08:43 AM] bonnie591#0591
hilton was really lenient back then LOL


[01-Jul-21 11:29 AM] ethan;#0003
Why is jumping with someone In cuffs even considered abuse


[01-Jul-21 11:29 AM] ethan;#0003
Cuffs don‚Äôt glitch like they used to


[01-Jul-21 11:30 AM] ethan;#0003
You used to like fly if you jumped


[01-Jul-21 11:42 AM] KjRBLX#2053
lol


[01-Jul-21 02:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
true, but its still kinda bad to do since it can be deemed as unprofessional


[01-Jul-21 02:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
its only minor anyway thats why it'll just be a suspension


[01-Jul-21 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591

[01-Jul-21 08:34 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! there is legit a leaker on the head team rn


[01-Jul-21 08:34 PM] stacey#1000
that is still leaking


[01-Jul-21 08:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
^


[01-Jul-21 08:35 PM] cory!#8287
oh.. right


[01-Jul-21 08:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think you should only do the copied answers one


[01-Jul-21 08:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
If that's leaked it doesn't really matter because only random hotel guests use copied answers


[01-Jul-21 08:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Doesn't really matter if it gets leaked


[01-Jul-21 08:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
@cory! @stacey @Tattoblue


[01-Jul-21 08:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
We could leave the other one for later


[01-Jul-21 08:38 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[01-Jul-21 08:38 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think it should be announced because then they will come up with even more copied answers....


[01-Jul-21 08:38 PM] stacey#1000
And will have even more copied answers to deal with.


[01-Jul-21 08:38 PM] stacey#1000
I trust 0 heads there is always one that leaks


[01-Jul-21 08:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Who even makes the copied answers


[01-Jul-21 08:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
Like all I know it was iiwaltdisney in 2017


[01-Jul-21 08:39 PM] stacey#1000
People do. They copy it from YouTube videos, a lot of people


[01-Jul-21 08:39 PM] cory!#8287
ill just wait


[01-Jul-21 08:39 PM] stacey#1000
I think announcing it will make it worse


[01-Jul-21 08:39 PM] stacey#1000
Cause they even use it on apps too


[01-Jul-21 08:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
I mean I don't think announcing will cause more copied answers to flood in since they probs won't even see the leak


[01-Jul-21 08:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's kinda important for the heads to know the copied answers otherwise people are gonna slip through

The proof is very weak but


[01-Jul-21 09:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
This is 100% flyro


[01-Jul-21 09:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
If not its 100% an alt account


[01-Jul-21 09:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
I unfriended 3 people at around that time, I checked and the other two has never used friend checker so it's very likely to be flyro


[01-Jul-21 09:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Apparently he's been calling people out over unnecessary things too


[01-Jul-21 09:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Lia pointed this out and apparently flyro has a grudge against lia

curious question

would you guys pban someone over this flag, i mean I get it has its controversies behind it but i dont think its worth a ban

idk if i should ban or not so just wanted some extra opinions!


[02-Jul-21 04:03 PM] cory!#8287
is that the ‚Äúblue lives matter‚Äù flag


[02-Jul-21 04:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah it's like the flag that signifies like the police ig


[02-Jul-21 04:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ummmmm


[02-Jul-21 04:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053

It really depends on the users intentions.


[02-Jul-21 04:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah that's what I thought. I mean that's the only proof provided so im assuming they didnt cause any trouble and I'm sure if there intentions were to troll around with that flag then yeah I probs would of banned


[02-Jul-21 04:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If they're just supporting police officers, then I wouldn't. But if they're to try and bring down any other movement or cause trouble, I would ban them.


[02-Jul-21 04:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yep yep, any other opinions that may disagree before i dismiss the ban?


[02-Jul-21 04:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
id say dont ban


[02-Jul-21 04:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

I should add an AFK thing that says when you are AFK to all bloxton games what do you guys think?


[02-Jul-21 10:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563
like add it to the nametag

it would be a nice feature


[02-Jul-21 10:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but it would expose a lot of people including myself.


[02-Jul-21 10:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
At the hotel when I'm banning someone..


[02-Jul-21 10:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
sometimes I just spawn in to view who im suppose to be banning and people think im afk


[02-Jul-21 10:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
or when i join trainings a little early and dont move


[02-Jul-21 10:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and just sit there and look


[02-Jul-21 10:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
or just act afk because of tons a questions being asked that could literally be solved by just clicking on the training time dummy


[02-Jul-21 10:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
or people asking "Are you the host?"


[02-Jul-21 10:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"Are you a HR?"


[02-Jul-21 10:35 PM] cory!#8287
sounds like a cool idea


[03-Jul-21 12:08 AM] acelesteq#9395
THAT TIME WE WERE AFK


[03-Jul-21 12:08 AM] acelesteq#9395
Like remember we talked about it one time about how it would expose people if it was a thing that Roblox made


[03-Jul-21 12:09 AM] acelesteq#9395
It‚Äôs a cool idea I‚Äôm not gonna lie but sometimes it‚Äôs a good thing not to have it incase someone wanted to annoy you a lot with unnecessary questions/comments that could easily be answered by other MRs or even LRs


[03-Jul-21 12:10 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Me: *standing there and not responding*
Literally somebody: "I know you're not afk."
Me: *-punching air-*


[03-Jul-21 12:10 AM] acelesteq#9395
LOL


[03-Jul-21 12:19 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

she was banned twice for being toxic and I doubt she changed so I wouldn‚Äôt want her back in the discord


[03-Jul-21 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
I think shes perm denied for good she had her chances and she bypassed ban on alt accs to at one point I think

@stacey @ethan; @bonnie591 @courtney @Tattoblue @lyss why cant he appeal again, is it just for leaking


[05-Jul-21 07:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
i dont really know who they are, but bman said "no appeals permitted". im happy for them to appeal if other agree though since we never really listen to that anyway


[05-Jul-21 07:15 PM] stacey#1000
whats their discord tag so i can check my dms with them


[05-Jul-21 07:15 PM] ethan;#0003
He‚Äôs super toxic


[05-Jul-21 07:15 PM] stacey#1000
cause someone leaked while actively trying to appeal and I think it was lucas


[05-Jul-21 07:16 PM] cory!#8287

[05-Jul-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000

december 8th?

she has done one hell of a good job


[05-Jul-21 10:49 PM] Polk#1596
changing her personality completely


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] ethan;#0003
im in another discord server with her and she talks about how jackson is the nicest person at bloxton


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] Polk#1596
so how did she get the intel


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] cory!#8287
i think sylveon was around when kylie was an mr if im not mistaken


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] ethan;#0003
so if we can find something of "emma" saying positive things about jackson thats another link


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] cory!#8287
but i might be wrong


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
she's in a groupchat with her and a few other blacklisted members


[05-Jul-21 10:50 PM] ethan;#0003
@cory! yeah i believe so also


[05-Jul-21 10:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think it's a shared account with other blacklisted members from what vicky was saying


[05-Jul-21 10:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
let me see what other screenshots she sent 1 sec

[05-Jul-21 10:51 PM] cory!#8287
oh yeah, that could be possible


[05-Jul-21 10:51 PM] Polk#1596
like is she sure its an alt


[05-Jul-21 10:51 PM] Polk#1596
or is she just suspicious of it


[05-Jul-21 10:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
So whether it's emma or not, they 100% have an ALT:

Emma is the only who got Management within the past few days


[05-Jul-21 10:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
And that was said 2 hours after the promotion


[05-Jul-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
wait


[05-Jul-21 10:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
And her profile is heavily suspicious after looking further into it


[05-Jul-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think its emma


[05-Jul-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
When I was promoting her


[05-Jul-21 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
I questioned her about her low account age and stuff


[05-Jul-21 10:53 PM] Polk#1596
well it does sound really suspicious when emmas account is most definitely an ALT, but there can be several reasons as to why


[05-Jul-21 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
and she told me her old account

[05-Jul-21 11:29 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[05-Jul-21 11:29 PM] lyss#0709
i dont think so, they sound entirely different and libby has an irish accent


[05-Jul-21 11:29 PM] acelesteq#9395
tbh it's either leaking or someone is an alt


[05-Jul-21 11:29 PM] acelesteq#9395
cause something isn't adding up


[05-Jul-21 11:30 PM] lyss#0709
different speech patterns too, they dont talk the same

[05-Jul-21 11:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
it's clear they had a friendship at one point


[05-Jul-21 11:31 PM] lyss#0709
probably a friendship, i feel like itd be difficult to fake an accent 24/7 and be active at bst friendly times if she wasnt bst


[05-Jul-21 11:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
i wonder who she tagged tho

[05-Jul-21 11:34 PM] cory!#8287
vickysglow was super close with kylie as well


[05-Jul-21 11:35 PM] cory!#8287
libby also seems to be close friends with vicky


[05-Jul-21 11:35 PM] cory!#8287
it might not be her cuz lyss does prove some points but idk


[05-Jul-21 11:36 PM] lyss#0709
yeah libby's friends with (or at least used to be friends with) a lot of toxic ppl, like ayesha, lily, ryley, etc. but i dont think her and kylie are the same people


[05-Jul-21 11:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah, lyss has some points and honestly its a bit crazy if someone actually faked their voice/tried to work with another timezone


[05-Jul-21 11:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
like thats a whole another level and just sad


[05-Jul-21 11:37 PM] lyss#0709
right, i think itd be impossible to do for a week let alone months on end

Oh, that is definitely interesting


[06-Jul-21 04:47 AM] xM_inn#2821
I've done some further reviewing of the leaked images and I don't *think* Libby is our leaker or an ALT. She could be one of their ALTs, but I don't think think so at the moment.


[06-Jul-21 04:48 AM] xM_inn#2821
If you look closely at this screenshot, whoever scribbled out the time of the images didn't do a very good job as if you look closely at the image below you can vaguely see that the time of that message was "23:04"

In GMT, that message was sent at 05:04 AM. So whoever is leaking must be 6 hours behind BST. Of course there could still be more than one ALT infiltrated right now, but I think we should focus on the solid evidence we have right now. We should grab a list of all MRs who are 6 hours behind BST and conduct checks on them and see if that narrows it down anymore.


[06-Jul-21 04:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
Additionally, I've been speaking more with Vicky and she's said that apparently n2oahh who was terminated was apparently one of their ALTs which is extremely interesting.

She's also mentioned that they have 5 MR accounts and a group chat with 8 people (likely blacklisted members) who operate these ALTs. So we *could* be dealing with more than one MR who is a blacklisted member and/or leaker, however for now I think we should try and focus on narrowing down our list to find out who leaked those staff lounge images.


[06-Jul-21 10:35 AM] cory!#8287
it could still be emma considering the account she "lost" was online 5 hours ago

[07-Jul-21 08:38 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 are you still planning to add a channel for MRs. Like MR rules since there was an issue with like MRs being disrespectful in VC‚Äôs and like left out and stuff. Not sure if we were still doing that


[07-Jul-21 08:39 AM] stacey#1000
Like stuff  we have had to announce a lot over and over that does nothing


[07-Jul-21 08:39 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah we can look to doing that after we do these server rules

yeah they always ask me if they can leave early for the next session


[07-Jul-21 10:12 AM] anna#0004
i send a pm and dismiss them when they're done interviewing anyway unless we're taking a pic for someone first ints bc they don't really have anything else to do except stand around


[07-Jul-21 10:16 AM] courtney#5125
if they ask to leave before theyre even able to join the training center (40 minute mark), then i ask them to wait. but if they ask to leave early after that then i let them bc theyre not rlly needed for anything else at interviews. id only ask them to stay if we were going to take a picture or something


[07-Jul-21 10:17 AM] courtney#5125
a lot of mrs usually finish after the join time for the training center has passed anyways tho

@anna question! when you say let her appeal, do you mean like have her send an appeal or let her revoke her ban like that?


[07-Jul-21 12:53 PM] anna#0004
send in an appeal, then if she was allowed id send that in and do another vote! she defo wouldnt be able to just get her ban removed without a detailed appeal!

yeahh


[07-Jul-21 01:07 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hadley. Out of that whole drama, up on the start of the consequences for that...I had to argue with Hadley the most. Continuing to try and justify her actions in the GC and make it seem like it was none of Bloxton's concern.


[07-Jul-21 01:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Even trying to bring up other situations (to get her off the hook) that had nothing to do with what she was involved in.


[07-Jul-21 01:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and I feel like she's still doing that because "and she also mentioned that her friend was let back in after being banned multiple times."


[07-Jul-21 01:10 PM] acelesteq#9395
Wasn't she also the one who got cyberbully by others too?


[07-Jul-21 01:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah, something like that. Believe it was Kylie and her friends.


[07-Jul-21 01:11 PM] acelesteq#9395
And she argued with you and got banned for cyberbullying...


[07-Jul-21 01:11 PM] acelesteq#9395
That's quite interesting..


[07-Jul-21 01:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well, she got banned for Cyberbullying because she bullied Masion in a GC with a couple of other users


[07-Jul-21 01:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
hadley has just had too many chances ngl and theres no real benefit to allowing her back in the server


[07-Jul-21 01:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But she argued heavily with me about her ban.


[07-Jul-21 01:12 PM] acelesteq#9395
Yeah I changed my vote


[07-Jul-21 01:12 PM] acelesteq#9395
Didn't know she did that but oh well


[07-Jul-21 01:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Even went as far as to try and say I was defending Mansion's actions.

Hadley should be perm denied forever. She‚Äôs already been banned twice before I believe and every time she‚Äôs let back in she gets involved in drama again. She is a literal drama queen


[07-Jul-21 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
I banned her before for getting involved with drama in general chat and then she appealed and got back in again then does drama again not long later and cyberbullies in a group chat. So.....never again.


[07-Jul-21 02:32 PM] lyss#0709
ME TOO


[07-Jul-21 03:03 PM] acelesteq#9395
why not "**middle-lounge**"


[07-Jul-21 03:31 PM] Polk#1596
you are gonna have more people complaining if u change it to mr lounge


[07-Jul-21 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah ikr people are gonna be salty about the name change if we did it but


[07-Jul-21 03:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
it makes it look so much more neater and makes more sense


[07-Jul-21 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
caught a manager once again trying to fail someone for missing periods and punctuation.....bruh this was just announced too. I had to remind them not to and stop the person from leaving for being falsely failed


[07-Jul-21 04:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
bruhh


[07-Jul-21 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
management rules should be updated in the discord to not fail people for that and stuff

when someone is due a promotion its unfair to not do it for like a month or whatever when others are being promoted


[08-Jul-21 02:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
they might not know they are pending but


[08-Jul-21 02:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
it can cause people to resign, especially mrs


[08-Jul-21 02:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
right


[08-Jul-21 02:36 PM] acelesteq#9395

[08-Jul-21 02:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
okay ty!


[08-Jul-21 05:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
probably not the best idea to let MRs have safe chat. they have to communicate more and if we have an MR with safe chat having a hard time understanding what someone is say trying to report at the hotel and it‚Äôs coming up as tags then it‚Äôs probably not gonna be an enjoyable experience


[08-Jul-21 05:15 PM] stacey#1000
true just thought id see your opinions but I agree with that


[08-Jul-21 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
while we here has anyone else heard or noticed the manager Jaiden like refusing to work LR ranks at the hotel when asked by like a guest if there is no bar or something, or another MR like  a senior asking them to work at a station and he refuses and avoids it


[08-Jul-21 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
I've been talking to a senior regarding it and they said he does it all the time, I've been trying to get proof but every time he does a shift its at like 3am for me


[08-Jul-21 05:21 PM] stacey#1000
here is what I have on it so far

[08-Jul-21 05:22 PM] stacey#1000
he apparently does this like every single shift....


[08-Jul-21 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank ^^ Thoughts on the MR above? If you think it's enough evidence to take action against him like a warning or suspension, let me know. I've been waiting for him to do a shift so I can go there and see for myself but it's always at like 3am for me so if anyone is on at that time and wants to look into it further they can but I have been looking at this for a week now and now I am asking for your help/opinions on it.


[08-Jul-21 05:26 PM] cory!#8287
managers have also reported to me that he hogs up naming n stuff but I‚Äôve only seen it once


[08-Jul-21 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
He has a pattern of leaving randomly when asked,  asking other MRs to do it and refusing, or really just ignoring it....


[08-Jul-21 05:26 PM] cory!#8287
I warned him to split evenly but idk if he does it or not anymore


[08-Jul-21 05:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he should know better, it‚Äôs been announced too about MRs just standing around, especially if he‚Äôs being told by a higher rank than him


[08-Jul-21 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
I am not sure if he still does that but for his hotel shifts hes basically trying to get free shifts by standing around doing nothing and refusing to work LR ranks.


[08-Jul-21 05:28 PM] stacey#1000
I have been waiting to get more evidence and like tried to go there myself on an alt to ask him but again hes never on when I am so if you think that is enough to suspend him or warn him (I lean more towards a suspension) let me know.


[08-Jul-21 05:28 PM] stacey#1000
Or if anyone wants to go there when he is on a shift then do that too cause I give up on waiting for him to go on shift when its always when I cant go


[08-Jul-21 05:29 PM] lyss#0709
ive been told about a few problems regarding jaiden too


[08-Jul-21 05:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Honestly what you provided is pretty firm proof


[08-Jul-21 05:29 PM] acelesteq#9395
Not sure if he was joking or not but it was quite upsetting to see that he kept asking Kyle (AKA A SENIOR) to do it instead because he was "better at it"


[08-Jul-21 05:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I would do a vote


[08-Jul-21 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
Also he doesn't listen to seniors like kyle at all when he should be


[08-Jul-21 05:29 PM] lyss#0709
why was he even riding the scooter around anyways that seems unprofessional for an mr


[08-Jul-21 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
cause I told kyle he has the right to ask him to do that because part of his job is to supervise the managers


[08-Jul-21 05:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
honestly I think something should be done about it


[08-Jul-21 05:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
It's quite disrespectful to not listen


[08-Jul-21 05:30 PM] lyss#0709
yeah he doesnt seem to respect ranks higher than him which is a problem in itself


[08-Jul-21 05:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah and being pretty disobedient. he shouldn‚Äôt have to question Kyle about it. It should just be done


[08-Jul-21 05:30 PM] acelesteq#9395
Exactly


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] cory!#8287
def a suspension


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
lrs get suspended for off task soo


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] bonnie591#0591

[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] acelesteq#9395
mhm


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yep


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] cory!#8287
he‚Äôs like the only mr other MRs bring up to me


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
also jaid did some stuff like brag to canary when he got head so yeah üíÄ


[08-Jul-21 05:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
deserved anyway


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
See this is why I was waiting, I wanted to catch him on a shift and see if he would listen to me if I aked him ccause that would be really bad but since I can never catch him on a shift rip


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] cory!#8287
Sam said he made sex jokes in a vc


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
does anyone want to suspend


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] cory!#8287
but idk how reliable that is


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
also how many days do you think, 3?


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] cory!#8287
ya that seems fine


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah 3 is fair


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
3 yes


[08-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq @drizzle this is your chance to do your first MR suspension and learn!!! I can help you with it if you want to


[08-Jul-21 05:33 PM] cory!#8287
I usually suspend LRs for 3 days for off-task/not listening


[08-Jul-21 05:33 PM] acelesteq#9395
:flushed_cool:


[08-Jul-21 05:33 PM] drizzle#4256

[08-Jul-21 05:33 PM] drizzle#4256
u can do it if u want to, idm!!


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
omg you grow up so fast you are already doing your first mr suspension im so proud


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] acelesteq#9395
LOL


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
how about you both do it since there is different steps


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
like one does one thing and the other does another


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
ill help ofc


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] drizzle#4256
ok!


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright bet


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] acelesteq#9395
**awaiting mother stacey to finish typing**


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
how about we just join vc for a min


[08-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
im too lazy to type


[08-Jul-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
if u want


[08-Jul-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
so since he is a manager


[08-Jul-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
the first thing u prepare is the suspension letter and one of you send it, but you dont send it right away you just prepare it


[08-Jul-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
then once the letter is ready, since he is a manager you have to first remove him from the trello boards like manager board, overflow board


[08-Jul-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
then you rank him to suspended, update roles in the discord


[08-Jul-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
then you send the suspension letter


[08-Jul-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
so one of you can send him the actual letter while the other removes from boards and updates roles in discord


[08-Jul-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
who would like to send the actual letter to him?


[08-Jul-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq @drizzle


[08-Jul-21 05:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright


[08-Jul-21 05:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
drizzle, what ya wanna do


[08-Jul-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
oh and then very last you make a suspension card on the HR board which is normal as any other suspension, the due date, reason, evidence


[08-Jul-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
whoever sends letter can make the suspension card


[08-Jul-21 05:37 PM] drizzle#4256
i can remove them from the boards and update them? idm


[08-Jul-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
and rank to suspended


[08-Jul-21 05:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright, ill send the letter and make the card


[08-Jul-21 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
i will make the letter for you


[08-Jul-21 05:38 PM] drizzle#4256
ok!


[08-Jul-21 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
so you can see what you do for it


[08-Jul-21 05:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
okay


[08-Jul-21 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
so dont do anything till thats done


[08-Jul-21 05:38 PM] stacey#1000
give me 2-3 mins


[08-Jul-21 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
Greetings **jaiduun**,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as **11 | Management** from Bloxton Hotels as of **July, 8th, 2021 at 6:45 PM EST**. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to **refusing to work LR stations at the hotel on multiple occasions by ignoring and avoiding when being asked.**. When you are at the hotel, you are required to work an LR station if there is no LR there to work it, especially if a hotel guest or another MR has asked for you to assist at a station. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude on **July 11th, at 7:00 PM EST** and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

**acelesteq**
**Shift Manager**
**Bloxton Hotels**


[08-Jul-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Jul-21 06:05 PM] stacey#1000
ive talked in the public press conference they did before and was the only one talking in front of like the 100+ people but actually planning and hosting one of those i dont think id do i just took over for ryan answering questions for 15 mins


[08-Jul-21 06:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I don't do much talking in public, but I will sometimes. I'm afraid someone is going to record and try and manipulate my voice to say something terrible.


[08-Jul-21 06:05 PM] cory!#8287

[08-Jul-21 06:57 PM] stacey#1000
honestly I dont think mara should stay banned, I think aud should because she actually leaked and had bad intentions, mara didnt seem to


[08-Jul-21 06:57 PM] courtney#5125
i agree with audrey staying banned for now, but i feel like mara didnt even do anything that bad to begin with


[08-Jul-21 06:57 PM] stacey#1000
I would unban mara


[08-Jul-21 06:57 PM] stacey#1000
and keep aud banned for the leaking part alone


[08-Jul-21 06:58 PM] courtney#5125
tbf clarity's had a toxic past where shes been v manipulative before but ü§∑


[08-Jul-21 06:58 PM] courtney#5125
ill do a vote for that then


[08-Jul-21 06:58 PM] stacey#1000
and yes even when clarity was an mr we had issues with her...i remember having to suspend her for being overly strict at the training centre


[08-Jul-21 06:58 PM] courtney#5125
right right


[08-Jul-21 07:00 PM] acelesteq#9395
I think mara should be unbanned now looking back at the screenshot


[08-Jul-21 07:00 PM] courtney#5125
she only said like three things to clarity


[08-Jul-21 07:00 PM] acelesteq#9395
after all there's not much proof of "harassment" its more like she was asking/curious need of a reply


[08-Jul-21 07:00 PM] acelesteq#9395
cause something happened behind the scenes


[08-Jul-21 07:01 PM] lyss#0709
clarity has always had a victim complex even back when i was her friend and i would believe it if mara said she took it out of context. i dont think what mara did warranted a ban


[08-Jul-21 07:01 PM] courtney#5125
^^^


[08-Jul-21 07:02 PM] lyss#0709
audrey leaked, which is a different story, but clarity can be a pretty manipulative person to get what she wants sometimes


[08-Jul-21 07:02 PM] courtney#5125
yeah exactly, thats also why im not too sure if id want her to become an mr again


[08-Jul-21 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
I would be against her becoming an mr again


[08-Jul-21 07:03 PM] acelesteq#9395
in general, it seems like a toxic behavior coming from clarity


[08-Jul-21 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
she hasnt changed at all


[08-Jul-21 07:04 PM] stacey#1000
we discussed her behaviour a lot here when she was an MR


[08-Jul-21 07:04 PM] acelesteq#9395
yep it really shows after she went and reported two people to us


[08-Jul-21 07:04 PM] lyss#0709
ive never gotten a good vibe from clarity ever. she hasnt changed over the past 3 years and being her friend in 2019 was hard


[08-Jul-21 07:10 PM] ethan;#0003
dont u have to be banned for a month to appeal


[08-Jul-21 07:11 PM] lyss#0709
she wasnt appealing she was just explaining her side of the story


[08-Jul-21 07:12 PM] courtney#5125
yupp

i wouldnt be surprised if he tries to turn it around on kyle if u show him proof


[08-Jul-21 10:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
yep


[08-Jul-21 10:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
ima wait on stacey reply tho


[08-Jul-21 10:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I feel like ive heard something on clarity


[08-Jul-21 10:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Not too sure


[08-Jul-21 10:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But back in the day 2020, i think i heard she did a giveaway for roblox and didnt give the robux


[08-Jul-21 10:53 PM] KjRBLX#2053
People kept asking where dah robux at and the person said it was coming


[08-Jul-21 10:54 PM] stacey#1000
I wouldn‚Äôt send the proof Kyle sent as I think he wants to remain anonymous


[08-Jul-21 10:55 PM] stacey#1000
I would just straight up tell him to be honest


[08-Jul-21 10:56 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq


[08-Jul-21 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
Tell him it‚Äôs based off multiple complaints he seems to purposely try to avoid it.


[08-Jul-21 10:57 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright


[08-Jul-21 10:57 PM] acelesteq#9395
and if he keeps asking for proof


[08-Jul-21 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
By either leaving the server when asked, or asking others to do it.


[08-Jul-21 10:57 PM] acelesteq#9395
what do i say on that


[08-Jul-21 10:57 PM] stacey#1000
Just tell him you can‚Äôt share it because it‚Äôs confidential


[08-Jul-21 10:58 PM] stacey#1000
And say it‚Äôs not just based off proof it‚Äôs based off multiple complaints because Kyle told me people have complaint about it before


[08-Jul-21 10:59 PM] acelesteq#9395
The HR Team has gotten multiple complaints that we can't share as it's confidential. By doing this, we looking through the complaints we have reviewed before discussing any disciplinary actions taken against you. These complaints include you either leaving the server when asked or asking others to do it which was highly unacceptable as there was an announcement not too long ago regarding this to all MRs. @stacey


[08-Jul-21 10:59 PM] acelesteq#9395
sounds nice or too mean??


[08-Jul-21 11:00 PM] stacey#1000
Yes that‚Äôs good


[08-Jul-21 11:00 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright

I would also say that this is a learning opportunity and is not permanent


[08-Jul-21 11:01 PM] acelesteq#9395
will add that


[08-Jul-21 11:02 PM] stacey#1000
Hopefully he owns up to his actions and will accept the suspension instead of lying about it


[08-Jul-21 11:03 PM] acelesteq#9395
yep he seems to understand

@bonnie591 homeboy got promoted now


[09-Jul-21 09:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
alr, ty ace!! :D


[09-Jul-21 11:06 AM] stacey#1000
What do you guys think of this person for a promotion. I see them at trainings a lot and seniors seem to agree but they still have 0 reports on the discord.....which worries me because if they don‚Äôt have 1 single report they may not know how to report and that‚Äôs a huge part of being a head so like MRs agree on this but I want to know your thoughts. https://trello.com/c/Hgxc1CLJ


[09-Jul-21 11:07 AM] stacey#1000
Not even 1 single report doesn‚Äôt look good to me.


[09-Jul-21 11:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
idm either way


[09-Jul-21 11:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
but if they never actually go to the hotel


[09-Jul-21 11:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
then they arent doing their job


[09-Jul-21 11:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[09-Jul-21 11:11 AM] cory!#8287
ive seen them report


[09-Jul-21 11:11 AM] cory!#8287
they just started reporting yesterday


[09-Jul-21 11:11 AM] cory!#8287
and i see them a ton


[09-Jul-21 11:11 AM] cory!#8287
so i think theyre fine!


[09-Jul-21 11:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
ah ok


[09-Jul-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôll add them for a promotion thing


[09-Jul-21 11:13 AM] stacey#1000
According to seniors they go to the hotel on smaller servers


[09-Jul-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
They just for some reason don‚Äôt report much


[09-Jul-21 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
Or ever


[09-Jul-21 11:15 AM] bonnie591#0591
ethann_n has only done a shift and a session since his inactivity notice. he'll have one more chance (one week) to increase activity or i guess a demotion to head will be applicable since his inactivity is bad but not lr demotion worthy. if he continues inactivity as head then we'll move him to lr


[09-Jul-21 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
Pls vote  or give thoughts https://trello.com/c/ZwDupHs7


[09-Jul-21 11:16 AM] stacey#1000
And yeah I never see that mr


[09-Jul-21 11:17 AM] cory!#8287
i dont think ive ever seen him as an hr üíÄ


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
same cory


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
never seen him as an hr


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 kaevibes is on an inactive notice until the 15th so should her card get extended?


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] cory!#8287
i forgot to ask u but since ur here


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah ill extend it later


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] cory!#8287
ok!


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
honestly i dont mean to call out any mr on notice but there's been quiet a few MRs so just been on notice


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
for so long


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
even when i was a head


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
like they get off notice for a week


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
come back


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
then go back


[09-Jul-21 11:18 AM] acelesteq#9395
and its a repeat


[09-Jul-21 11:19 AM] stacey#1000
Is mirk getting fired yet or is he fired


[09-Jul-21 11:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
he


[09-Jul-21 11:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
cheated on his inactivity notice but if he doesnt improve then yes


[09-Jul-21 11:21 AM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs been a head for literally well over a year...


[09-Jul-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
And hadn‚Äôt done anything for months so it‚Äôs about time he just gets fired


[09-Jul-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
He is just here for the rank but doesn‚Äôt contribute.


[09-Jul-21 11:22 AM] stacey#1000
He makes up lies to not do anything and keep the rank.


[09-Jul-21 11:22 AM] bonnie591#0591
hes done one session recently but if he doesnt improve before his review date (25th of this month) then demoshion


[09-Jul-21 11:22 AM] cory!#8287
ive seen that too ace but i dont think we can do much unless its consecutive inactivity notices i think


[09-Jul-21 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
When we have meeting tomorrow we can discuss MRs going on notice over and over again and how long until they can actually get fired from it.


[09-Jul-21 11:23 AM] stacey#1000
Like if it‚Äôs 5+ months long....then why are they still an MR.


[09-Jul-21 11:24 AM] bonnie591#0591
we could go over every mr if u want and see how their activity is


[09-Jul-21 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
@cory! you can‚Äôt accept notices that have no end date

They have to put an end date of at least a month


[09-Jul-21 11:25 AM] cory!#8287
OH idk why i thought it had an end date


[09-Jul-21 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs where we have the issues of like people going inactive forever.


[09-Jul-21 11:26 AM] stacey#1000
They can‚Äôt just put ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm inactive till idk when!!!, I‚Äôm gonna be gone for 5+ months and do nothing‚Äù


[09-Jul-21 11:26 AM] acelesteq#9395
he legit comes onto discord


[09-Jul-21 11:26 AM] acelesteq#9395
talks in lounge everynow and then


[09-Jul-21 11:27 AM] acelesteq#9395
its just unfair at this point tbh but eh


[09-Jul-21 11:27 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve been waiting for mirk to get fired forever


[09-Jul-21 11:28 AM] stacey#1000
He should‚Äôve been fired last month but used an inactive notice as an excuse once again but he will get fired by end of this month


[09-Jul-21 11:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
Honestly I think I was too nice to mirk


[09-Jul-21 11:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
I've given him another month


[09-Jul-21 11:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
But he certainly doesn't deserve it


[09-Jul-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
He is legit just lying to you to keep the rank...and not doing anything.


[09-Jul-21 11:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
After he edited the end date of his inactivity notice because he accidentally but may 25th instead of June 25th..


[09-Jul-21 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs done this forever. It‚Äôs what he does. He makes up random excuses for a notice to keep extended, extending, and extending to do nothing and have the rank


[09-Jul-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
He was promoted in August 16, 2019 by train and he‚Äôs still the same rank....that is saying something


[09-Jul-21 11:34 AM] bonnie591#0591
Honestly that's true


[09-Jul-21 11:34 AM] bonnie591#0591
Only done one session since his cheated inactivity notice ended


[09-Jul-21 11:34 AM] bonnie591#0591
We'll dismiss later.


[09-Jul-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
Like fr almost 2 years the same rank....


[09-Jul-21 11:34 AM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs sad


[09-Jul-21 11:35 AM] bonnie591#0591
Probs not gone to hotel since January


[09-Jul-21 11:35 AM] bonnie591#0591
And also I think he was on Stapleton earlier so


[09-Jul-21 11:35 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah he'll be gone when I get home


[09-Jul-21 11:36 AM] bonnie591#0591
I was gonna give till 25th but he doesn't deserve it


[09-Jul-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Ty finally he gets fired


[09-Jul-21 11:36 AM] bonnie591#0591
Anyway brb I'll be on my walk now


[09-Jul-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
No point in giving him more time


[09-Jul-21 11:36 AM] stacey#1000
Ok


[09-Jul-21 11:36 AM] bonnie591#0591

[09-Jul-21 12:45 PM] anna#0004
what did he leak


[09-Jul-21 12:45 PM] Polk#1596
interview mr procedures


[09-Jul-21 12:46 PM] Polk#1596

[09-Jul-21 12:46 PM] Polk#1596
i scrolled up in hr announcements but couldnt find anything


[09-Jul-21 12:48 PM] anna#0004
oh yea


[09-Jul-21 12:48 PM] anna#0004
i forgot to dm him


[09-Jul-21 12:48 PM] anna#0004
bonnie said to dm him with a reminder but i was doing something, ill do it now @Polk


[09-Jul-21 12:51 PM] Polk#1596
like just a friendly reminder?


[09-Jul-21 12:52 PM] Polk#1596
in my opinion it should warrant a written warning seeing as he leaked restricted MR+ only information which was supposed to remain classified


[09-Jul-21 12:52 PM] Polk#1596
we warned our lovely @acelesteq for minor leaking but that was just posting bot commands in sl


[09-Jul-21 12:53 PM] Polk#1596
if u dont want to do it i will, but i dont think its fair to only give just a reminder


[09-Jul-21 12:53 PM] anna#0004
lee said he saw heads do it but he just deleted their messages or something so that means heads will have got away with it


[09-Jul-21 12:53 PM] anna#0004
and the report was sent in quite late


[09-Jul-21 12:53 PM] anna#0004
i already dmed him


[09-Jul-21 12:53 PM] Polk#1596
its hasnt even been 2 weeks ago since he did it


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] Polk#1596
so i wouldnt say thats old


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] Polk#1596
oh ok


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] anna#0004
not old


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] anna#0004
quite late


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] Polk#1596
well, even if that is true, that makes jess' warning or any other warning for leaking seem unfair


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] Polk#1596
well how late did u receive the report


[09-Jul-21 12:54 PM] anna#0004
u can dm him if u want be hes already said sorry for it now and im sure he just didnt know


[09-Jul-21 12:55 PM] anna#0004
it was sent yesterday


[09-Jul-21 12:56 PM] Polk#1596
ah ok


[09-Jul-21 12:56 PM] Polk#1596
well id say thats a still pretty fresh report, but if u already dmed him its fine


[09-Jul-21 12:57 PM] anna#0004
ok


[09-Jul-21 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
mirk is offically demoted

[09-Jul-21 05:31 PM] acelesteq#9395
@stacey he was legit at firestone yesterday


[09-Jul-21 05:31 PM] acelesteq#9395
for over an hour


[09-Jul-21 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
he also did a session recently as well so he coudlve jsut came back


[09-Jul-21 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[09-Jul-21 05:31 PM] anna#0004
yeah hes starting to get his activity back im pretty sure, bc hes gone through a lot


[09-Jul-21 05:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
its fine, he might of just wanted to have fun as well as begin to become active again


[09-Jul-21 05:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
idk just to be on notice for over a year now its just unfair


[09-Jul-21 05:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
like i get he probs want thru some stuff and wants to be active again


[09-Jul-21 05:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
but why would it take a year


[09-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
he was active in january


[09-Jul-21 05:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
usually it would be a month wise


[09-Jul-21 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
but hes been inactive for a long time yes but he never posted the reasoning on his notice for some reason


[09-Jul-21 05:33 PM] anna#0004
part of it was him being inactive because of school then when he wanted to get active again he started going through stuff at home


[09-Jul-21 05:33 PM] anna#0004
so he had to be inactive longer


[09-Jul-21 05:33 PM] acelesteq#9395
ill vote yes and we'll see


[09-Jul-21 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
why was he demoted if he just did a session or multiple


[09-Jul-21 05:34 PM] acelesteq#9395
i dont blame him for going on notice for personal stuff


[09-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
if hes given one more chance and goes inactive again like this the terms can be he can be demoted to 7 without being sent an inactive notice again as this is his last last chance


[09-Jul-21 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
if he does sessions dont we usually extend the period we are keeping an eye on him for


[09-Jul-21 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
cus thats what we did with megan


[09-Jul-21 05:34 PM] ethan;#0003
she was active for a week or two


[09-Jul-21 05:35 PM] ethan;#0003
then died again


[09-Jul-21 05:35 PM] anna#0004
yeah i think he should have his rank back to see how he goes this time since he only just started getting back his activity then was demoted


[09-Jul-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
ok ill re-rank him and this is his last last chance


[09-Jul-21 05:36 PM] ethan;#0003
want me to dm him so he understands this is his last chance


[09-Jul-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
i can dm him its all good


[09-Jul-21 05:36 PM] ethan;#0003
ok


[09-Jul-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
but u can re-rank if u want


[09-Jul-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
and update roles in discord


[09-Jul-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
while i dm him


[09-Jul-21 05:39 PM] ethan;#0003
what even is his username now


[09-Jul-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
mirkismissing


[09-Jul-21 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
he knows hes being given one last chance and that if he goes inactive again he will just be demoted without being sent a notice

[10-Jul-21 03:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
u can put it in the rules anyway


[10-Jul-21 03:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
id like a rule about my guidelines and like that you must follow it at all times and stuff when warning people


[10-Jul-21 03:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
ill write that rule later


[10-Jul-21 03:14 PM] cory!#8287
there was a suggestion on the mb that was about making a guide about which reasons correspond to a warning, suspension, etc since some of them were confused about that I think


[10-Jul-21 03:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Manager rules:
1. Do not fail trainees/interviewees over minor things (Missing periods, commas, etc.)
2. Double check usernames on reports when putting them on the trello.
3. Check for duplicate reports before putting your report on the trello.
4. Do not be host bias.
5. Be productive during hotel shifts, do not fake your hotel logs.


[10-Jul-21 03:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes!


[10-Jul-21 03:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats a good idea


[10-Jul-21 03:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yeah go over the things i dont have


[10-Jul-21 03:16 PM] cory!#8287
and the dont fail someone for no periods should be for reports as well, like don‚Äôt warn someone for not using periods


[10-Jul-21 03:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes sure


[10-Jul-21 03:18 PM] Tattoblue#5828
We should do the same thing for questions maybe so they should give other people the opportunity to answer questions in the questions channel thats what ive noticed

As a reviewer at the Hilton Hotels Reports Discord server, we expect you to review reports sent in by the public. It is very important that you go through this entire guide to ensure you're doing your job as a reviewer correctly.

As a reviewer on the Hilton Hotels Reports server, you are to review the reports sent in by the public. In order to do this properly, make sure to go through this guide.

To accept a report, request the ban/suspension on the Trello Management Board and attach the evidence. After that, react with a ‚úÖ on all proof messages included in the report.

To decline a report, react with an ‚ùå on all proof messages included in the report.

- Proof Messages (React to)

Images
Links
GIFs
Any sort of files

- Non-Proof Messages (Don't react to)

Text
Links to Roblox profiles

- When accepting and declining a report, please make sure to react on all proof messages. We don't want you to react on one proof message and leave the others with nothing. This includes images and links. Text is not considered a proof message, please don't react on it.

- If a reported user is already dealt with, please accept the report. This shows the reporter that the user has been dealt with.

- When reviewing, please try to review the oldest unreviewed reports. If you see two unreviewed reports, please review the oldest one first as it has been pending for a longer time.

- If one proof message is valid and another one isn't, please accept the report as long as there is enough evidence. This includes reacting on all proof messages.

- If you happen to come across a chat conversation in a report channel, simply delete the messages by right clicking on the text, and clicking "Delete Message".

- If you happen to come across someone who is violating the rules, you are to warn them with the ?warn command or kick them from the server depending on what they've done. If it's ban worthy, feel free to message a Senior Management+ so they can ban them.

MR Rules:
[-] MR channels should not be leaked, all of these channels should be kept confidential. Failure to comply with this rule will lead to consequences.  

[-] Trolling at allied/non-allied groups is unacceptable and shouldn‚Äôt be done whatsoever. Alliance or not, you‚Äôre representing Bloxton at ALL times. 

[-] When at sessions, you shouldn‚Äôt leave unless told otherwise by the host.

[-] When attending a Training/Interview session, you should arrive no later than 40 minutes prior to a session starting. This is to ensure everyone gets a fair chance to assist.

[-] Respect your fellow MRs in voice calls & in the MR-Lounge. Treat others the way you would like to be treated.

you should follow all the server rules at all times unless exceptions are made in certain channels or by an HR

- be nice
- not rude
- be nice :)
- be nice


[10-Jul-21 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
I HAVE SOME RULE IDEAS


[10-Jul-21 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
dont go inactive for more than a week without putting a notice in


[10-Jul-21 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
you should aim to attend 2 sessions a week and shift at the hotel a few times a week


[10-Jul-21 03:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes stacey agreed


[10-Jul-21 03:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
do these 2 rules sound good too


[10-Jul-21 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
also


[10-Jul-21 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
some mrs are like


[10-Jul-21 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
really afraid to go on inactive notices


[10-Jul-21 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
or do only 1-2 sessions per day


[10-Jul-21 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
likee


[10-Jul-21 03:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
they overwork themselves


[10-Jul-21 03:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could make it so


[10-Jul-21 03:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can go inactive for 2 months within a 6 month period. if they need to go inactive for longer then they need to contact an hr and have a proper reason for it


[10-Jul-21 03:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
so basically 4 months max per year


[10-Jul-21 03:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[10-Jul-21 03:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
if they really need more then they can dm an hr and we can discuss it as a team


[10-Jul-21 03:42 PM] ethan;#0003
what about two weeks with a minimum of 5  weeks in between


[10-Jul-21 03:42 PM] ethan;#0003
and then we can allow specific circumstances


[10-Jul-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
some mrs need to go inactive for a month due to summer camps, exams, vacations etc. i think one month should be the limit which can be extended for another month at the end, but after that they need to dm an hr


[10-Jul-21 03:43 PM] courtney#5125
i like bonnie's suggestion


[10-Jul-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[10-Jul-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can go inactive for 2 months within a 6 month period. if they need to go inactive for longer then they need to contact an hr and have a proper reason for it

this means 4 months max per year @High Rank

[10-Jul-21 03:43 PM] courtney#5125
i feel like mrs appreciate that we're somewhat lenient with inactivity notices than some other groups are. i dont see the need to being super strict and forcing our mrs to work at all times when they have their own lives


[10-Jul-21 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
i can do it


[10-Jul-21 03:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[10-Jul-21 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
then send it to bloo


[10-Jul-21 03:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh ok


[10-Jul-21 03:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah


[10-Jul-21 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
yep same for you


[10-Jul-21 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
but realistically it will take a long time before you get demoted for inactivity as an hr since we're very lenient on it


[10-Jul-21 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
so even if u didnt have a notice you'll probs be fine for a while


[10-Jul-21 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah


[10-Jul-21 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003

[-] It is highly encouraged that if you‚Äôre aware of an MR committing a major offense or breaking a rule, we ask that you come forward regarding the situation. Let it be known that if you were aware about a major offense a fellow MR committed and kept quiet about it, you will also receive consequences.

Inactivity notices are submitted in #mr-notices. You are encouraged to fill a notice in if you cannot be active for more than a week. There are various reasons for inactivity notices such as:

-Attending a summer camp.
-Needing a break due to lack of motivation.
-You have a busy week/month ahead of you that you need time off for.
-Device has broke.
-Exams.
-Needing to get settled into your school schedule (1-2 weeks at the start of the school year if you need it).
-Personal reasons.
-Many other reasons.

Activity rules:

[1] - You are subject to a demotion if you go inactive for a long period of time without a notice.

[2] - You can only go inactive for 2 months within every 6 month period. This is around 4 months maximum per year.

[3] - If you need to go inactive for more than 2 months within a 6 month period, then you must dm an HR for permission before submitting your notice.

[4] - You are highly encouraged to place an inactivity notice if you want/need to. Inactivity notices doesn't affect your reputation as the HR team understands if you need time off.

[5] - The bare minimum for our MRs are 2-3 sessions and shifting a few times per week. This isn't strictly enforced, if you can't always meet these expectations then that's fine, however, you'll be considered as semi-inactive.

[6] - You should never overwork yourself while working at Bloxton Hotels. Feel free to go above and beyond, but ensure this healthy and you're prioritising your real life at all times!

i kinda forgot she was a senior


[10-Jul-21 04:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

emmy hasnt hosted for me since november


[10-Jul-21 04:15 PM] lyss#0709
i noticed she is online more doing shifts and stuff so


[10-Jul-21 04:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
if emm_yy goes inactive again then we'll consider demotion to manager or something /shrug


[10-Jul-21 04:16 PM] Tattoblue#5828
emm_yy hasnt hosted for me since august of last year üíÄ


[10-Jul-21 04:16 PM] lyss#0709
emmy has never hosted for me


[10-Jul-21 04:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah its like bonnie said one time  that this isnt a summer job and then you go on notice for like the rest of year so if that happens with her we may gotta reconsider he senior position


[10-Jul-21 04:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
im fine for them to move down to manager but then again we'll probs demote them to lr eventually ;-;

[10-Jul-21 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez can you add in rules for all MRs they need to work LR ranks at the hotel if there is not enough LRs there to cover it instead of just standing there if that is not in the rules already


[10-Jul-21 09:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
Gasps


[10-Jul-21 09:15 PM] acelesteq#9395


[10-Jul-21 09:15 PM] acelesteq#9395
sheeshhh


[10-Jul-21 09:15 PM] stacey#1000
so do you think any action should be taken against Imag, or should we wait until the new rules are announced?


[10-Jul-21 09:15 PM] acelesteq#9395
honestly she's been here for 3 years, she should know better as a senior too


[10-Jul-21 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
yeah I mean hasnt it been announced to mrs or managers before to work LR ranks


[10-Jul-21 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
or wasnt it just common sense already?


[10-Jul-21 09:16 PM] acelesteq#9395
it's something that should be remembered by other seniors too who been here for a while too since it isn't a new rule that was made a long time ago


[10-Jul-21 09:16 PM] acelesteq#9395
its common sense in a way


[10-Jul-21 09:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ngl I think this is pretty serious. We may need to exile and blacklist


[10-Jul-21 09:17 PM] lyss#0709

[10-Jul-21 09:17 PM] acelesteq#9395
it was made a few months ago


[10-Jul-21 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
its not anything major enough sadly for that but I think she should be given a written warning at the least


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
or we could suspend...?


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Off task for lrs is a warning but moves towards a suspension if they refuse after being asked. Therefore warning is fair


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
but yeah she wasnt asked so


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
just a warning


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
warning is fine, plus the clip only shows like a few minutes of it


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
we dont know if the server happened to get small and staff started to leave


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
so just like a friendly warning reminder


[10-Jul-21 09:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah


[10-Jul-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
does anyone want to warn her


[10-Jul-21 09:20 PM] acelesteq#9395
warning as in warning letter, correct?


[10-Jul-21 09:20 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[10-Jul-21 09:20 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright just making sure cause i got mixed up reading warning reminder >_<


[10-Jul-21 09:20 PM] acelesteq#9395
i could send it if nobody else wants to


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 BOD approval to warn?


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
:check:


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq yes I can help with letter if u want


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
but there is letter templates on the board


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] acelesteq#9395
i think i got it understood how to do it


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] stacey#1000
so u can use that then just add everything into whats blank


[10-Jul-21 09:22 PM] acelesteq#9395
just write into the stuff


[10-Jul-21 09:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeahh


[10-Jul-21 09:23 PM] stacey#1000
the reason is being off task at the hotel/not working LR ranks when there was only 1 LR on the server.


[10-Jul-21 09:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
got it


[10-Jul-21 09:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
thank you!


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Wait


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Let me check her warning record


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] acelesteq#9395
but what if she asks for proof-


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
She has a lot of past users


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] acelesteq#9395
oh alright


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
oh


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
if she asks for proof just say its classified


[10-Jul-21 09:24 PM] stacey#1000
plus she should already know she was off task and be honest about it without asking for proof


[10-Jul-21 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
its only a warning and nothing major major as well


[10-Jul-21 09:25 PM] acelesteq#9395
in general, is all proof when giving warnings, suspensions, etc  classified?


[10-Jul-21 09:25 PM] acelesteq#9395
unless said otherwise, ofc


[10-Jul-21 09:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Only 1 verbal warning so basically this is her first warning


[10-Jul-21 09:25 PM] stacey#1000
yeah cause most people want to remain anonymous


[10-Jul-21 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
unless its like proof that doesnt show the person who reported it


[10-Jul-21 09:26 PM] stacey#1000
but this one it does


[10-Jul-21 09:26 PM] acelesteq#9395
mhm, makes sense


[10-Jul-21 09:26 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright ill send it to her


[10-Jul-21 09:27 PM] stacey#1000
alrighty


[10-Jul-21 09:28 PM] stacey#1000

[11-Jul-21 09:37 PM] cory!#8287
he said he had to leave urgently and couldnt tell anyone


[11-Jul-21 09:37 PM] cory!#8287
when he probably could


[11-Jul-21 09:37 PM] cory!#8287
he shouldve at least dmed me so his session wouldnt have gone on longer than it was supposed to


[11-Jul-21 09:42 PM] acelesteq#9395
right but honestly his parents could've been yelling at him or someone needed him asap.


[11-Jul-21 09:42 PM] acelesteq#9395
that happened to me sometimes in the past since my parents like to threaten to take my keyboard and stuff away

[12-Jul-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez in the rules for MRs can you add that there should not be more then 2 MRs on one server at the hotel as there is always more MRs needed on other servers if its not in the rules already. and maybe add if there is 2 in one and the server is calm that there should only be one on a server as well


[12-Jul-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
im on a server with 3....


[12-Jul-21 05:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
isn't there a rule about the mr limit being 3?

{Reactions}
uparrow 

[12-Jul-21 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
no I thought it was 2


[12-Jul-21 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
if its 3 i think we should change it cause 3 is a lot...


[12-Jul-21 05:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
True


[12-Jul-21 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
I also dont think even 2 is needed on a server if the server is calm and there is other servers with no mrs


[12-Jul-21 05:27 PM] stacey#1000
but 2 is fine as well


[12-Jul-21 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
It does stop a group of 3 Mrs shifting together so ehhh


[12-Jul-21 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
Nice to make shifts enjoyable


[12-Jul-21 05:39 PM] lyss#0709
i think 3 mrs is and has been fine; shifts are still supposed to be fun, not just something you have to force yourself to do all by yourself with no friends

2emm6 accidentally did the attendance command wrong and made it show in the chat. since its her first time doing the command, no consequence will be issued but just letting u know that happened!!!


[18-Jul-21 01:57 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Can we get bear or baby to make a admin plugin for that command? Because so far, i‚Äôve messed up saying it like 2-3 times and sometimes its just because i forgot there‚Äôs a space at the beginning of my message i think


[18-Jul-21 01:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
And don‚Äôt worry about non seniors or hr+ being able to do it because they could just put a :GetRankInGroup function on to filter out who‚Äôs trying to do the command


[18-Jul-21 02:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I only ask because can‚Äôt we just use the command bar (bar that pops up when u click ‚Äò)


[18-Jul-21 02:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
probs wont do that method again since it takes so long to set up and its now hurting my eyes BUT what do u guys think of it


[18-Jul-21 02:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm maybe

[18-Jul-21 02:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
YES BUT THEN I REALISED IT WAS GONNA TAKE SO LONG TO DO AND ITS ALSO STUPID CUZ RANKING EVERYONE UP TO 18 WOULD TAKE SO LONG USAGBFAYG

[19-Jul-21 02:46 AM] bonnie591#0591
Sorry that u had to deal with him you shouldn't be disrespected like that


[19-Jul-21 05:36 AM] stacey#1000
Oh that‚Äôs the guy I blacklisted yesterday. He left and went to my interviews so I suspended and then server banned with a warning in the ban reason not to do it again then he leaves group again 2 mins later and goes to the second interview server and learned nothing so I blacklisted him


[19-Jul-21 05:37 AM] bonnie591#0591
smh


[19-Jul-21 05:37 AM] stacey#1000
They learn nothing and are rude so I would probably add that to their blacklist card in case they try to appeal @cory!


[19-Jul-21 05:50 AM] stacey#1000
Read the ticket yikes he really disrespected you I‚Äôm sorry Cory


[19-Jul-21 05:51 AM] stacey#1000
You are a great HR and know how to do your job that guy knows nothing but making assumptions against people.

I did not think the person I blacklisted yesterday would come and cause more drama üíÄ


[19-Jul-21 11:24 AM] bonnie591#0591
if he came respectfully without rejoining the group and explained his side of the story then maybe we would of had sympathy for him and looked further into it but his attitude is a dead give away that theres no point even giving him a second chance üíÄ

I‚Äôm pretty sure dash came back on alt accounts before during her blacklist...


[20-Jul-21 09:09 AM] stacey#1000
She has just done way too much so I vote no for that reason she really does not deserve to appeal in my opinion.


[20-Jul-21 09:12 AM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX this plus harassed high ranks, pretty sure she came back on alts at one point, trash talks people, and uh a lot more

Idk if you guys want to give her a chance you can but I vote no because she just blew all her chances before and did way too many things and she was on my list of people I‚Äôd never appeal along with Ava and meme.

[20-Jul-21 09:17 AM] stacey#1000
To sum it up when she tried to appeal before in the past she would Dm some HRs that are formers now and harass them and add them to gc‚Äôs to attack them


[20-Jul-21 09:27 AM] courtney#5125
yeah hasnt dash just done way too much at this point? i feel like shes run out of chances

Let people know it's not legit and an announcement would prevent people from hopefully not getting scammed somehow


[20-Jul-21 02:55 PM] babymariobebe#7563
The chat was talking about it earlier


[20-Jul-21 02:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
its a trusted website but idk if the person who made it can get your address. im presuming they may be able to since real organisations will need to contact people


[20-Jul-21 02:56 PM] bonnie591#0591

[20-Jul-21 06:43 PM] ethan;#0003
arty is just used to hanging around different people and not used to how easily people in bloxton general get hurt from words


[20-Jul-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
Just block them @acelesteq


[20-Jul-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000

[20-Jul-21 06:43 PM] acelesteq#9395

[20-Jul-21 06:43 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah they won‚Äôt succeed in getting in group banned


[20-Jul-21 06:43 PM] acelesteq#9395

Don‚Äôt give him any reaction


[20-Jul-21 06:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
lol how many fs people have a problem with BH?


[20-Jul-21 06:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
wouldnt say a problem, its more like its a "joke" for them to use


[20-Jul-21 06:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
like for example: "omg ace you work at a pixel hotel, how does it feels???"


[20-Jul-21 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm gonna get off my phone and enjoy my movie now I need to stop talking to people about arty and all his drama


[20-Jul-21 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs gone and just trying to get a reaction  from people now

@bonnie591 he said he just wants the reason thats it


[20-Jul-21 06:47 PM] acelesteq#9395
why he was banned


[20-Jul-21 06:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
Community blacklisted for major discrimination and causing drama.


[20-Jul-21 06:48 PM] acelesteq#9395

I've noticed him being toxic and having quite an attitude ever since joining Firestone so I'm quite glad he's blacklisted now

right because I blocked him so he cant contact me :))


[20-Jul-21 11:27 PM] Fraux#7971
didn‚Äôt Jack sa someone or sum


[20-Jul-21 11:28 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes Kyle


[20-Jul-21 11:28 PM] Fraux#7971
Then that should be a definite no..? Am I right?


[20-Jul-21 11:29 PM] Fraux#7971
If Jack were to get honor, Emma shpuld too. SA is far more severe than what she had done.


[20-Jul-21 11:29 PM] stacey#1000
Emma does want to get Honor as its been over a year and she hasnt done anything major since


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] stacey#1000
she also helped provide evidence to blacklist arty so...I think she should honestly be given a chance if shes able to


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] stacey#1000
same with trey


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] Fraux#7971
Exactly, it‚Äôs ridiculous she hasn‚Äôt gotten it.


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] Fraux#7971
Doesn‚Äôt trey have his?


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] stacey#1000
oh idk


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] Fraux#7971
I think I‚Äôm wrong ifk


[20-Jul-21 11:30 PM] stacey#1000
they both do have a former HR role


[20-Jul-21 11:31 PM] Fraux#7971
I‚Äôm wrong he doesn‚Äôt


[20-Jul-21 11:31 PM] Fraux#7971
Regardless, insubordination is far less severe than sexual assault is. They should be considered for honor member before Jack would be.


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] xM_inn#2821
Trey and Emma could probably be looked into too, but that's a separate matter. Let's discuss Jack for now.


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] Fraux#7971
Sexual assault is major. That‚Äôs gross. No from me.


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] stacey#1000
what did jack do to get it taken again


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i agree with fraux


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] stacey#1000
i dmed baby just to see his thoughts on if emma was eligible for it so thats all ill say on it


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] cory!#8287
idk much abt jack but if he did that then i wouldnt give it to him


[20-Jul-21 11:32 PM] stacey#1000
i mean i dont mind given him another chance


[20-Jul-21 11:33 PM] stacey#1000
if its been awhile


[20-Jul-21 11:33 PM] stacey#1000
but idk what he did to get it taken


[20-Jul-21 11:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm tryna find the records of when it was removed 1 sec


[20-Jul-21 11:34 PM] Fraux#7971
I‚Äôm also going to go find records of the reason why it was taken


[20-Jul-21 11:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok open this with caution, this is what I found in regards to the sexual assault claims BUT

[20-Jul-21 11:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Keep in mind this is from 2019 AND it was after his employment as a High-Rank


[20-Jul-21 11:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Considering it is from 2 years ago, there is a chance he's improved somewhat


[20-Jul-21 11:35 PM] stacey#1000
yeah it was well over a year ago


[20-Jul-21 11:35 PM] stacey#1000
i think he can be given a chance


[20-Jul-21 11:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm gonna see if I can find anything else


[20-Jul-21 11:36 PM] cory!#8287
oh if he did that like 2-3 years ago he prob changed then


[20-Jul-21 11:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
okay so that's all I've been able to find


[20-Jul-21 11:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
he has no blacklist records and isn't banned in the Discord or anything right now


[20-Jul-21 11:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
There were a few claims of racism from 2019 which were mentioned here but I can't find any evidence against it


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] stacey#1000
hes a higher rank at venti or was after that so he couldve changed from that


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] stacey#1000
but i dont really know him at all either so


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] stacey#1000
i just voted yes


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think we can give him a second chance as Stacey said


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] Fraux#7971
let me search some


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
If he isn't suitable, it'll be removed again


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ok ping me if u find anything fraux


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] Fraux#7971
and then i will revise my vote as needed


[20-Jul-21 11:38 PM] Fraux#7971
gotchu!


[20-Jul-21 11:43 PM] Fraux#7971
ok ive only found a few more things

that is all 4 now


[20-Jul-21 11:48 PM] Fraux#7971
n-e ways.. i would go with no for now but i also think the topic of emma and trey receiving honor needs to be revisited while we are on jack. it was over a year ago, plus i know for a fact they have matured past that 100%


[20-Jul-21 11:49 PM] Fraux#7971
also


[20-Jul-21 11:49 PM] Fraux#7971
im still thinking over my vote


[20-Jul-21 11:49 PM] stacey#1000
Baby has said emma is not eligible for honor member I asked him


[20-Jul-21 11:49 PM] Fraux#7971
as it is not as sever as i had originally recalled


[20-Jul-21 11:49 PM] Fraux#7971
that literally makes no sense


[20-Jul-21 11:50 PM] lyss#0709
same opinion as fraux atm


[20-Jul-21 11:50 PM] Fraux#7971
just give them their honor, it's not like they're acting maliciously and making expose videos and whatnot


[20-Jul-21 11:50 PM] lyss#0709
about jack AND emma and trey


[20-Jul-21 11:50 PM] Fraux#7971
it's childish stuff at this point, it's time to put it in the past


[20-Jul-21 11:51 PM] courtney#5125
i agree with fraux and lyss's points


[20-Jul-21 11:51 PM] Fraux#7971
the owners are grown, emma and trey are grown, therefore no one has any malicious intent.


[20-Jul-21 11:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
Emma & Trey can definitely be discussed with the Founders, but I think we should still keep both topics as separate discussions.


[20-Jul-21 11:56 PM] xM_inn#2821
At the moment, our focus should be Jack since that is who we're considering for Honor Member currently.


[20-Jul-21 11:57 PM] stacey#1000
I understand Jack did stuff in the past but I don't think any of that evidence is recent, thats still from over a year ago.


[20-Jul-21 11:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
2 years if I'm right, all of that stuff is dated back to early 2019 which was just a few months after his resignation. That doesn't make it okay, of course. But it does signify the possibility that Jack has changed. Nothing of the like has ever been reported against him since and all of this never occurred during his tenure as a High-Rank member.


[20-Jul-21 11:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Hmmm


[20-Jul-21 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
He also never did like multiple things, it was all related to one thing mostly.


[20-Jul-21 11:59 PM] stacey#1000
I honestly think he deserves a chance.


[20-Jul-21 11:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Idk as much as I would like to give him another chance, every time I look at those screenshots I‚Äôm like ehhh. I‚Äôm in the middle rn if I‚Äôm being honest


[21-Jul-21 01:03 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôm gonna give Jack the benefit of the doubt. Worst comes to worse we have to revoke his honor role. It‚Äôs about 2 years since then, plus he was at Venti for quite a while so hopefully he‚Äôs changed his ways.


[21-Jul-21 01:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
Disagreed with Jack and I doubt baby would give Emma and trey the honour role since they were fired


[21-Jul-21 01:58 AM] bonnie591#0591
We only give the honoured role to hrs who resign


[21-Jul-21 01:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
As for Jack, I don't believe his previous behaviour suits honour member so in my opinion I disagree, but he's able to get it if you all agree

@KjRBLX honestly forgot he got hacked but as far as i know, no


[21-Jul-21 09:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
That‚Äôs odd

arent we able to send evidence of another group's mr violating our rules as long as that evidence only stays between us and that group's hr team?


[21-Jul-21 10:40 PM] courtney#5125
i was able to send evidence to a boba hr of their mr violating our rules in sl like a year ago and it just stayed between the part of the hr team that was investigating it


[21-Jul-21 10:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
^ to add on, when i was there you guys sent a docs full of proof regarding a former (CB) back in 2019 or 2020 who happened to be an MR during the time i was there


[21-Jul-21 10:42 PM] acelesteq#9395
i think it could be fine but to make sure, you should try to actually reach out the the VP of SB


[21-Jul-21 10:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ah alright. Just wanted to make sure cause I couldn‚Äôt quite remember if we did or not. ty guys!

What are your guys thoughts on mush_r00my for a possible head position? Shes been an LR for 2 and a half months. She‚Äôs quite active and reports/attends sessions daily or almost daily and a lot of LRs guess her at other promotions so she‚Äôs known in the community. The thing that‚Äôs held me back is her join date on roblox is May 6th and she joined Bloxton on May 8th, 2 days later....so not sure if she is to be trusted so I want to know your thoughts on it please.


[22-Jul-21 03:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
eh


[22-Jul-21 03:27 PM] cory!#8287
shes sus


[22-Jul-21 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
yeah I dont think she can really be trusted


[22-Jul-21 04:31 PM] acelesteq#9395
idk shes ok in attending trainings


[22-Jul-21 04:31 PM] acelesteq#9395
but hotel wise not much


[22-Jul-21 04:32 PM] acelesteq#9395
and account is a bit concerning since she recently made it


[22-Jul-21 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
Can you guys let me know your thoughts on my announcement?


[22-Jul-21 05:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
i havent noticed it but i dont host üò≠


[22-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
At mine not long ago in the very first row there was 6 people doing grammar test and 1 MR in that row, then there was 3 people waiting doing the grammar test with like 5 MRs standing there so I had to tell them to go do it


[22-Jul-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs one example


[22-Jul-21 05:33 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq @drizzle @emily @ethan; @lyss tagging because you are online have either of you noticed it


[22-Jul-21 05:33 PM] acelesteq#9395
i havent noticed any issues at all with it


[22-Jul-21 05:34 PM] lyss#0709
^^^ i dont think i really have either


[22-Jul-21 05:34 PM] emily#4444
same w ace


[22-Jul-21 05:34 PM] drizzle#4256
ive noticed it


[22-Jul-21 05:34 PM] stacey#1000
do you think we should just make an announcement regarding it?


[22-Jul-21 05:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[22-Jul-21 05:35 PM] lyss#0709
yeah i mean it couldnt hurt to do an announcement if some people are noticing that happening


[22-Jul-21 05:35 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I‚Äôll make one


[22-Jul-21 05:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I haven‚Äôt noticed anything either. but yeah an announcement doesn‚Äôt hurt


[22-Jul-21 05:52 PM] cory!#8287
I noticed it


[22-Jul-21 05:52 PM] cory!#8287
I made one abt it a couple months ago but prob some of the newer ones didn‚Äôt realize it


[22-Jul-21 05:53 PM] cory!#8287
or some forgot


[22-Jul-21 08:10 PM] cory!#8287
created the BRT timezone role for the person i promoted, just a fyi


[22-Jul-21 08:49 PM] cory!#8287
@stacey were they actually a cb? cuz i ddint find anything in their record


[22-Jul-21 08:49 PM] stacey#1000
no


[22-Jul-21 08:49 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Jul-21 08:50 PM] ethan;#0003
i see nothing wrong with those images


[22-Jul-21 08:51 PM] Fraux#7971
i don‚Äôt rly find that rude


[22-Jul-21 08:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's not really that welcoming


[22-Jul-21 08:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
If u were a new mr and saw that u wouldn't really feel welcome


[22-Jul-21 08:51 PM] stacey#1000
Making comments like "who is that" when someone gets promoted is rude


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
and saying "they are a former cb!!" is also rude as well...


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm acc leaning towards a suspension


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
if I were a new MR I would not want to see that

that comment on the tik tok video


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
is rude as well


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
he has been an MR for a long time and should not be making these comments towards promotions


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] stacey#1000
or HRs


[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] Fraux#7971

[22-Jul-21 08:52 PM] stacey#1000

but the ones regarding the promotions


[22-Jul-21 08:53 PM] stacey#1000
is rude


[22-Jul-21 08:53 PM] Fraux#7971
i mean as far as he knows someone could‚Äôve told him that they were a former cb


[22-Jul-21 08:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
@ethan; remember to make BTS_Trash999's fire card and blacklist card


[22-Jul-21 08:53 PM] Fraux#7971
so that‚Äôs why he may think that


[22-Jul-21 08:53 PM] stacey#1000

It works but u probs put a random space in it somewhere


[22-Jul-21 08:54 PM] Fraux#7971
ehh i mean he didn‚Äôt really say it in a rude way‚Ä¶


[22-Jul-21 08:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Setrank just demotes


[22-Jul-21 08:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
But since major cuff abuse is a blacklist u will need to make a blacklist card too


[22-Jul-21 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
I think he should just get a warning


[22-Jul-21 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
I dont think its major enough for a suspension


[22-Jul-21 08:57 PM] Fraux#7971
i agree


[22-Jul-21 08:58 PM] stacey#1000
but if he gets enough votes for a suspension and other people think it should be a suspension too thats fine as well


[22-Jul-21 08:59 PM] emily#4444
hes been an mr for long enough to know not to do that, imagine getting promoted and seeing someone saying that about u :flushed_cool:  but i understand why youd vote for a warning instead


[22-Jul-21 08:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ima stick with suspension just cuz it seems deserved


[22-Jul-21 09:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
*thinks*


[22-Jul-21 09:00 PM] stacey#1000
if he gets enough votes for suspension or warn someone else can warn or suspend i have to get off shortly


[22-Jul-21 09:02 PM] cory!#8287
he has 2 warnings i checked


[22-Jul-21 09:02 PM] cory!#8287
so he would get suspended anyway if im not wrong?


[22-Jul-21 09:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
Oh that's fun


[22-Jul-21 09:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah. I was gonna say just a very strict warning I think but since he has 2 already.....


[22-Jul-21 09:03 PM] stacey#1000
oh yeah true


[22-Jul-21 09:03 PM] stacey#1000
my vote is for suspend then


[22-Jul-21 09:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
I mean


[22-Jul-21 09:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
If we vote suspend


[22-Jul-21 09:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Technically that's not a warning so he's gonna get a guaranteed suspension again next time


[22-Jul-21 09:04 PM] stacey#1000
or we can do a warning and then say since its his 3rd its a suspension


[22-Jul-21 09:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
So we can either be nice and let him get a 3rd warning or just do a regular suspension


[22-Jul-21 09:04 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[22-Jul-21 09:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
eh its his fault if he gets another warning after this


[22-Jul-21 09:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well


[22-Jul-21 09:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
If he had 1 warning I would vote suspension so ima stick to it


[22-Jul-21 09:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since in my opinion its suspension worthy

travel should know better. he‚Äôs been a manager for almost 3 months now. it‚Äôs like emily said I wouldn‚Äôt wanna see that said about me if I was promoted and if he‚Äôs a CB travel should come forward about it instead of just saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a CB he‚Äôs a CB‚Äù

Yeah, I'll do it if you want.


[22-Jul-21 09:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm very hesitant. I don't know if I wanna potentially go back in forth in dms tonight with a suspended MR about why their actions were wrong.


[22-Jul-21 09:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank who would like to be a kind little dahling and do it instead of kj since he deserves a break


[22-Jul-21 09:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
now ik suspensions r mean and annoying but unfortunately its part of the job which we all share


[22-Jul-21 09:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[22-Jul-21 09:35 PM] acelesteq#9395
he's asking for proof


[22-Jul-21 09:35 PM] acelesteq#9395
now


[22-Jul-21 09:37 PM] stacey#1000
u can send uh


[22-Jul-21 09:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
is this my second time suspending someone so like is proof allowed if asked for things like this


[22-Jul-21 09:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
or is it classified


[22-Jul-21 09:37 PM] stacey#1000
this doesnt show who the reported is


[22-Jul-21 09:37 PM] stacey#1000
so u can send some stuff


[22-Jul-21 09:37 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
so basically in cases where people ask for proof


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
it needs to be proof that doesnt show people who reported them


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
correct?


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
if it doesnt show who the reporter is or they cant figure out who the reporter is its all good


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
so like those 2


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
are good to send


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
alright, ill remember that for next time


[22-Jul-21 09:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
thank you stacey

[22-Jul-21 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
anyway*


[22-Jul-21 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
it shows him saying they are a cb


[22-Jul-21 09:39 PM] stacey#1000
and then "what who is that"


[22-Jul-21 09:55 PM] acelesteq#9395
mhm


[22-Jul-21 09:55 PM] acelesteq#9395
he didnt ask for anything else so we good


[23-Jul-21 10:33 AM] courtney#5125
not really leaking since the channel names are mostly public info, but since the screenshot is obviously recent, it might be something to keep an eye out for if more leaking starts happening

ok!


[23-Jul-21 03:50 PM] stacey#1000
I voted no on aidans appeal because I think he needs more time and he also always seems to be involved in drama. Before he was banned he had his former role removed for being in drama as well, I personally just would give him more time.


[23-Jul-21 03:50 PM] stacey#1000
thats just my opinion though


[23-Jul-21 03:53 PM] lyss#0709

Placed Maya the senior management under suspension as a precaution until she is sure her account is safe.


[23-Jul-21 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank someone help me out I need maya removed from all Bloxton trello boards as well as a precaution as well. I‚Äôm on mobile


[23-Jul-21 07:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[23-Jul-21 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt want it all getting deleted if she is compromised


[23-Jul-21 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
Ty


[23-Jul-21 07:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
is there even any point of having an overflow board anymore


[23-Jul-21 07:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
we all reviews bans on time now


[23-Jul-21 07:12 PM] stacey#1000
No but I‚Äôm not deleting it just in case cause you never know for the future


[23-Jul-21 07:12 PM] stacey#1000
Bans were reviewed on time when I was a manager as well


[23-Jul-21 07:12 PM] stacey#1000
But then it changed again. You never know


[23-Jul-21 07:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could close it (but not delete)


[23-Jul-21 07:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
so we can reopen it if needed


[23-Jul-21 07:13 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt want ownership of it anymore anyways


[23-Jul-21 07:13 PM] stacey#1000
How do I get rid of ownership or do I just delete it


[23-Jul-21 07:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
let me check


[23-Jul-21 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe in settings @stacey


[23-Jul-21 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
under workspace


[23-Jul-21 07:14 PM] stacey#1000

Honesty wish people would report these things sooner that way they‚Äôre never promoted, then again I think that people probably have the mindset of ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll probably never get promoted anyways so‚Äù and then don‚Äôt do it


[26-Jul-21 01:48 AM] ethan;#0003

cus from those images in announcements, seems like he likes to cancel people and attack them and shit talk them


[26-Jul-21 01:49 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
All of the people he talked about are still current MRs which now the MRs who reported know about

I see it now I believe


[26-Jul-21 05:15 AM] stacey#1000
I really hate when people report things late because we can‚Äôt really fire someone that said stuff back in February. There is only 1 thing from this month and that is not enough to take action against them I don‚Äôt think.


[26-Jul-21 05:16 AM] stacey#1000
I think all we can do is rank lock them.


[26-Jul-21 05:16 AM] stacey#1000
I would like to terminate them but it wouldn‚Äôt be a fair termination because of the fact evidence is really dated. People shouldn‚Äôt report things so late and come up with excuses as to why they didn‚Äôt report them.


[26-Jul-21 06:49 AM] acelesteq#9395
I agree ^


[26-Jul-21 06:49 AM] acelesteq#9395
Tbh it‚Äôs very upsetting and disappointing knowing that someone talked all that even about others then they got promoted later on in the future?


[26-Jul-21 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
I added a couple of people to promotion opinions and one is up for grabs if anyone wants to claim it or give thoughts please and vote if you agree.


[26-Jul-21 09:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
Both users haven't even worked here for a month @stacey


[26-Jul-21 09:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
And I'd say more time is needed to observe tbh


[26-Jul-21 09:39 AM] stacey#1000
I commented that on the card.


[26-Jul-21 09:39 AM] stacey#1000
Their 1 month is legit in like 2-3 days.


[26-Jul-21 09:39 AM] stacey#1000
I commented if given another week or so they would probably be good


[26-Jul-21 11:16 AM] courtney#5125
a lot of managers seemed to agree with their suggestions as well


[26-Jul-21 11:20 AM] stacey#1000
^^ if you look at how many reports they have both are extremely active at the hotel which is more then I‚Äôve seen for other LRs so they honestly are more then ready.

[29-Jul-21 03:27 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt really think we need it if we have tickets tbh. I am not sure what threads could be useful for except like for questions or concerns but we have tickets for that so


[29-Jul-21 03:30 PM] courtney#5125
threads might be a little unorganized based on what ive seen just by scrolling through other servers that use them. we also have the questions channel and several ticket categories to address any concerns someone may have

I see it as their own opinion wise


[30-Jul-21 10:17 AM] acelesteq#9395

Posting this here: Ranked deedees alt account d8ede to management because her main got terminated from roblox for a really dumb reason so she is trying to appeal it. Her alt is now ranked.

[30-Jul-21 03:48 PM] stacey#1000
yep roblox is really dumb for moderating which is why I rarely talk in roblox chat and vc with people instead or message on discord


[30-Jul-21 03:48 PM] acelesteq#9395
