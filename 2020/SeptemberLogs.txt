with someone who would be beneficial and not problematic


[01-Sep-20 07:38 PM] courtney#5125

its super fancy


[01-Sep-20 11:11 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@ethan; That hotel is basically a showcase, while it looks amazing, it is too laggy, and too cramped (I feel claustrophobic in the build, check the hotel bathrooms). The functionality and scripts are rather simplistic too.

@High Rank I wanted to bring this up during the meeting this Saturday, but I cannot wait much longer as this is deeply concerning. I understand that we are now transitioning from summer to fall, in which the new school year will provide many challenges to our members considering the virtual year ahead of us. However, our server insights are putting us into a brutal situation, with our member retention off by almost 20% from 35%+ only a mere couple weeks ago. 

I'm not blaming any of you for this, but we need some ideas to quickly rebound a little here. Please provide them below or brainstorm some for the meeting this Saturday.


[02-Sep-20 03:08 PM] Fraux#7971
hotel wise we could do a fall update


[02-Sep-20 03:09 PM] impact#0297
@babymariobebe @Beartikal Fall Update for V6? Is this possible?


[02-Sep-20 03:10 PM] Fraux#7971
fall update September 22 and October 1 add halloween stuff, remove it nov 1


[02-Sep-20 03:10 PM] Fraux#7971
keep fall@decor til winter


[02-Sep-20 03:10 PM] impact#0297
I think our application for Discord sponsorship with high-grade servers is now at risk of being pulled because of this shitty member retention.


[02-Sep-20 03:11 PM] impact#0297
So Fraux and others, I would really appreciate any good ideas. Perhaps we could also go through our talkative requests and approve them?


[02-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Fraux#7971
I usually am pretty good with talkative requests but I‚Äôve been without internet for almost a week so I can‚Äôt really go through them


[02-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Fraux#7971
And then like cell service wise it‚Äôs awful so


[02-Sep-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
boba does this thing where they give away like 100 robux to the person that speaks the most in the discord server every month, then 50 robux to second place, etc


[02-Sep-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
we need something like that so we can pull people back into the server


[02-Sep-20 03:20 PM] Polk#1596
or we can do another discord event like karaoke


[02-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
or can also do like more drawing contests. Maybe like themed to fall to get everyone in the mood for spooky/pumpkin season


[02-Sep-20 03:45 PM] impact#0297
i don't want to do things that necessarily discriminate a bunch of people


[02-Sep-20 03:46 PM] impact#0297
for example, people who have no mics could not participate in that prize


[02-Sep-20 03:46 PM] impact#0297
for example, people who are not artistic could not participate in the drawing contest


[02-Sep-20 03:46 PM] impact#0297
or atleast would be less willing to


[02-Sep-20 03:47 PM] impact#0297
I would like to have this event/prize/program target everyone, regardless of skillset or interests


[02-Sep-20 03:47 PM] ethan;#0003
i remember in v3 there was an AMAZING HALLOWEEN UPDATE


[02-Sep-20 03:47 PM] ethan;#0003
with a graveyard


[02-Sep-20 03:47 PM] ethan;#0003
and you could make potions


[02-Sep-20 03:51 PM] Polk#1596
i can assure you, if you do a poll about if they want a karaoke night in announcements they will all vote yes


[02-Sep-20 03:51 PM] Polk#1596
people find it entertaining to just listen to it


[02-Sep-20 03:51 PM] Polk#1596
thats all i have for suggestions


[02-Sep-20 05:08 PM] impact#0297
is there any criteria for the youtuber role on our discord


[02-Sep-20 05:09 PM] courtney#5125
yes


[02-Sep-20 05:09 PM] courtney#5125
they need to have at least 1,000 subscribers


[02-Sep-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
Wait let me show u the example of the report I declined


[02-Sep-20 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
for an example


[02-Sep-20 05:27 PM] courtney#5125
yes, i think it should be at least 6 times. saying something (thats small) 4 times is not spamming, it doesnt fill up the chatbox


[02-Sep-20 05:28 PM] anna#0004
its probably because our rule has been 4+ times is classed as major spamming but i'd say thats more for bigger sentences rather than a single word


[02-Sep-20 05:29 PM] stacey#1000
here is 2 examples


[02-Sep-20 05:29 PM] courtney#5125
agreed with anna. large paragraphs that fill up the chatbox can be considered spamming at 3-4+ times, as they have been. but spamming a smiley face 4 times or saying a word that tags up a single line or two of chat isnt spamming

yeah like


[02-Sep-20 05:29 PM] courtney#5125
a lot of times when a song plays a word that repeats


[02-Sep-20 05:29 PM] xM_inn#2821
@courtney unacceptable


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] courtney#5125
for example watermelon sugar high


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
like that guy only said "No" 4 times and gets reported for major spamming....


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] courtney#5125
ppl will say it at training a lot. i never considered it spamming, theyre just singing the song


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
so should i prepare an announcement for managers?


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] courtney#5125
same with anqellix saying watermoo


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn permission to make an announcement to managers?


[02-Sep-20 05:30 PM] courtney#5125
@xM_inn i know im just a valuable asset in that server! oh well!


[02-Sep-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey go for it


[02-Sep-20 05:31 PM] xM_inn#2821
@courtney -__-


[02-Sep-20 05:31 PM] anna#0004
theyre probably just getting confused since people do get told that major spamming is 4+ times, but theyre definitely taking it too literally so ya announcement would be good to clear that up!!


[02-Sep-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[02-Sep-20 05:31 PM] stacey#1000

:bloxton3: **MAJOR SPAMMING CLARIFICATION**:bloxton3: 

Greetings, Managers.

Recently, there has been many reports made on major spamming, that is in fact not major spamming. We are aware you may have been told major spamming is saying something 4+ times, but major spamming is actually more if something is said 6+ times. For example, if someone says ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 4 times, that is **NOT** major spamming. There has been many reports made with something similar to this that is minor. Now, if it is spamming paragraphs of things that is clearly made to spam, then yes that is major spamming.

However, for something to be considered major spamming it should be said 6+ times, because we don‚Äôt want to be too strict and ban someone for saying something 4 times. Also, when you get evidence of major spamming it is best to get the chatlog proof, as it shows more if it‚Äôs major spamming. Chatbox proof is still allowed, but keep in mind if they are only saying something 4 times, **DO NOT** accept the report.  Going forward, please remember not to be too strict on these things and if you are confused about a report don‚Äôt be afraid to ask another manager, senior, or HR for assistance. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this announcement, feel free to contact any member of the HR team.

Best regards,
staceyvx
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels

Cbs are so desperate to get a ranks they make brand new discord accounts to claim they were not ranked to trick people into ranking them, then when they get ranked they of course abuse. Fell for it once, never falling for it again.


[02-Sep-20 09:02 PM] ethan;#0003
yesterday i didnt rank 2 people and 5 minutes after i kick them i get a message from 2 discord accounts made 2 minutes before


[02-Sep-20 09:02 PM] ethan;#0003
asking why they wherent rank


[02-Sep-20 09:04 PM] stacey#1000
Ya I fell for it like a week ago. Never again.

Okay, so my throat has been itching, now it's sore. I'm thinking it's a cold.


[04-Sep-20 07:22 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But I wont really start thinking about an inactive notice til I get tested and it says positive.


[04-Sep-20 07:22 AM] KjRBLX#2053
But, I haven't seen any kind of sickness stop me from playing roblox.


[04-Sep-20 07:23 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Plus, I'm scared to get tested. Cuz I don't wanna get tested and don't have corona and they say im positive.


[04-Sep-20 10:37 AM] Fraux#7971
@KjRBLX hope everything is okay!! take some time to rest!!


[04-Sep-20 11:06 AM] impact#0297
@KjRBLX get tested or isolate for 14 days


[04-Sep-20 11:07 AM] impact#0297
just cause you are afraid to know the truth doesn't give you a reason to be reckless


[04-Sep-20 11:07 AM] impact#0297
i'd actually recommend you get tested, because there is a lot of free $$$ for people who are tested positive


[04-Sep-20 11:07 AM] impact#0297
free meals, paycheck assistance, gov assistance, etc


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] Fraux#7971
@impact i think that‚Äôs when minn is doing his camping event


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
@impact HRs are hosting the event at that time


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] impact#0297
Well shit.


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] impact#0297
Any options I could more around on?


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] Fraux#7971
what about an hour earlier


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
Any other time?


[04-Sep-20 11:14 AM] stacey#1000
maybe an hour later?


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] impact#0297
I could do it later...


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] Fraux#7971
event might surpass an hour?


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] stacey#1000
the event should only be an hour


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] impact#0297
It's gonna be a long meeting... that's the thign


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] Fraux#7971
I see


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] impact#0297
So we should do later if we want to have actual discussions


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] Fraux#7971
i have to work at 4 tomorrow


[04-Sep-20 11:15 AM] impact#0297

[04-Sep-20 02:52 PM] courtney#5125

[04-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Fraux#7971
hmm


[04-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Fraux#7971

[04-Sep-20 02:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
appeals her blacklist just to get banned few months later for toxicity


[04-Sep-20 02:54 PM] Fraux#7971
maybe one more month


[04-Sep-20 02:54 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[04-Sep-20 02:55 PM] courtney#5125

If so whoever banned her from the discord why not blacklist and ban her from the hotel and everything as well? Cause well she got a job lol

No idea if this is the Ava I‚Äôm thinking of or not

[04-Sep-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
Or not cause idk


[04-Sep-20 09:41 PM] stacey#1000
Who banned her from the discord


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
You should‚Äôve blacklisted if you knew it was an alt acc of Ava cause she got a job lmao


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
and no ava_ix


[04-Sep-20 09:42 PM] stacey#1000
Not avatw


[04-Sep-20 09:43 PM] stacey#1000
The one that made tea videos and such and cause lots and lots of drama to never in a million years get unblacklisted


[04-Sep-20 09:43 PM] impact#0297
I know it's not avatw but unsure about ava_ix


[04-Sep-20 09:43 PM] stacey#1000
Ban reason is it‚Äôs an alt acc of ava_ix but I need to know who banned her to verify


[04-Sep-20 09:44 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I got no clue if it‚Äôs her but if it is she gets fired and blacklisted on that acc too


[04-Sep-20 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey is that not ava_ix?


[04-Sep-20 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
The main account name is avaaqx and I looked at profile and other usernames was not that


[04-Sep-20 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
So I‚Äôm confused on if it‚Äôs her or another random Ava

i think its some random ava


[04-Sep-20 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
Cause like she never got blacklisted and got a job


[04-Sep-20 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
So like


[04-Sep-20 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
I thought it was a random Ava but then her ban reason was for being an alt acc of ava_ix


[04-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
that‚Äôs not ava_ix


[04-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
she just became a rlly salty and rude lr


[04-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
she was the one who a bunch of mrs blocked bc she went to trash talk and be rude in dms


[04-Sep-20 09:57 PM] courtney#5125
but it‚Äôs not ava_ix, as far as ik


[04-Sep-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
Just confused on her ban reason on the discord lmao


[04-Sep-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
If she was falsely banned for that I‚Äôm unbanning her


[04-Sep-20 10:42 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i have no idea why she wouldve been banned from disc, bc shes not ava

@Hilton Founder jsyk there is a lot of lag at the hotel recently for people. Even myself I had to close discord. I asked other people and I‚Äôm not the only one


[05-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Fraux#7971
@stacey i heard there was an audio that lags it


[05-Sep-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
Like the hotel music?


[05-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Fraux#7971
Like on the boom box


[05-Sep-20 01:03 PM] stacey#1000
Cause I‚Äôve never lagged this bad before


[05-Sep-20 01:03 PM] Fraux#7971

I saw that last night and totally forgot I was half asleep lol


[05-Sep-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
Well when no one plays audios it still lags. Mostly when discord is open


[05-Sep-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
I had to switch to mobile


[05-Sep-20 01:04 PM] impact#0297
might be your discord overlay


[05-Sep-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000
Or I wouldn‚Äôt be able to host this event with all this damn lag


[05-Sep-20 01:04 PM] xM_inn#2821

[05-Sep-20 01:04 PM] stacey#1000

[05-Sep-20 01:05 PM] xM_inn#2821

[05-Sep-20 01:05 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 02:12 PM] katie#0200
maybe like we make a form? users can fill it in and leave their discord tag so we can contact them to tell them if it's accepted or declined


[05-Sep-20 02:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I would of said make a game where people can submit but only people with a ban can submit


[05-Sep-20 02:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Unless we try and merge it into one of our current boards


[05-Sep-20 02:13 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 02:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

Or whoever they contact can just refer them to the forms


[05-Sep-20 02:25 PM] ethan;#0003
and pin it


[05-Sep-20 02:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[05-Sep-20 02:26 PM] xM_inn#2821

[05-Sep-20 02:26 PM] Fraux#7971
like for example some kids that get banned at hotel


[05-Sep-20 02:26 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 02:26 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 02:26 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 02:29 PM] katie#0200
when we review them, we'd delete each thing so that they dont all pile on top


[05-Sep-20 02:29 PM] katie#0200

vac put months into this


[05-Sep-20 02:32 PM] xM_inn#2821

we cant have them using this gala place
its disguised and appears official
we cant allow them to use any bloxton assets or decals, etc.
theres B logos, stolen models, etc

[05-Sep-20 02:34 PM] xM_inn#2821

[05-Sep-20 02:34 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 02:34 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
tehre is


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
so


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
can we maybe discuss some kind of mr training


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] xM_inn#2821
slay candy


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
after mrs get promoted


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
a lot of them dont know what to do


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
so maybe we could have it mandatory for them to spectate an interview session or something


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] emily#4444
:D


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
pastriez does that, boba does that


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
I like that idea


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] courtney#5125
very effective for them


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] Polk#1596
oh u mean shadowing


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] katie#0200

[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oh yeah i remember us talking about that


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] Fraux#7971
100% agree, no need for us to throw them in straight away


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] emily#4444
i think its a good idea!


[05-Sep-20 02:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
like 2 weeks ago and i love the idea


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] katie#0200
when we liike promote them we make them an intern or something and if they pass trainigs they get their rank right


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] courtney#5125
when i promoted cheifjohntawwne she asked if there was an mr training or smthg for her


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
What if we had a standard guide we all used for promotions and then we quizzed them ? (on top of the supervised thingies)


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yess a standard promo guide


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596
we would have a basic medium rank training, an exam, and three supervised shifts


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Fraux#7971
yes !


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] courtney#5125
itd be cool if they could spectate shifts or interview sessions or smthg


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Fraux#7971
yea


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] ethan;#0003
supervised shifts...


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Polk#1596
its a joke LOL


[05-Sep-20 02:52 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
i got my idea


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm not thinking exam, but more like a 5-question random quiz over what you've mentioned in the guide


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
lmk when to send


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
well problem not idea


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] xM_inn#2821
To make sure they understand


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] Polk#1596
so like recommended


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe every other week there can be a general MR training that all mrs can attend or something


[05-Sep-20 02:53 PM] Fraux#7971
recommended but not required


[05-Sep-20 02:54 PM] courtney#5125

go ethan!


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] ethan;#0003
Give shift managers super admin, instead of normal admin, and give seniors admin. This would allow shift managers to host banning sessions and seniors can permanently ban. And also, at the training managers automatically get mod without the HR needing to go and mod them, same with the interview center, heads and managers automatically get moderator. This would save time and cause HRs less stress because they will not need to go to 100 servers before every session. AND it would clear the manager board up from lag if seniors had admin and shifts had super admin


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] ethan;#0003

good and bad things can come out of it


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
EEEE idk about that, our current upgrade we gave to seniors is working pretty fine rn


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
And like


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] courtney#5125
^


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] Fraux#7971
:pban a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] xM_inn#2821
An abuse of Pban could be a disaster


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] ethan;#0003
but what about at the training and interviews center


[05-Sep-20 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
not sure I agree with seniors getting permissions to pban


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] Fraux#7971
im not against the idea


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000
I agree with the training and interview server thing yes


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] Fraux#7971
@ethan; yeah ur always late


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
its annoying having to pend too


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] ethan;#0003
because im slow


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] ethan;#0003
.


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] ethan;#0003
.


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] Fraux#7971
yeah i know


[05-Sep-20 03:01 PM] courtney#5125
yeah lyss said ur slow sometimes! üò≥


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] katie#0200
i make sure seniors make some space so its quick for me


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] ethan;#0003
i x out of the game and i think im pending in


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] ethan;#0003
but im not


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] ethan;#0003
and 5 minutes later i notice i never pressed play


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] courtney#5125
i tell them all to slock and kick 5 minutes prior to the session's start time


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] Polk#1596
thats a good point ryan


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] Fraux#7971
yea


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] Polk#1596
we need some rank structure as well


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000
seniors can already server ban


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] ethan;#0003
maybe not the hotel idea but the training idea  should be implemented


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] stacey#1000
so I dont think they need to be able to pban


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] Fraux#7971
bloo likes admining servers ‚ú® he crazy


[05-Sep-20 03:02 PM] courtney#5125
its bloos favorite pasttime


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well actually i dont go mod the mrs, i give admin to the seniors cause thats way quicker


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] ethan;#0003
AND it would prevent people with similar names trying to get mod not get mod


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] courtney#5125
well its easy to check joinlogs


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] Fraux#7971
ethan it would be the same


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] courtney#5125
or tell ur seniors to check joinlogs for u


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] Fraux#7971
with that


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] Fraux#7971
that is their specialty too tbh


[05-Sep-20 03:03 PM] ethan;#0003
when i go to mod servers people always think the server isnt getting hosted because i left


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] ethan;#0003
so some people leave the server


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] ethan;#0003
at ints


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] Fraux#7971
do the host command


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] Polk#1596
i think it can wait until V7 when baby and bear makes the new admin


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] courtney#5125
yeah the more power we give to seniors, the more the senior and shift ranks tend to blend together


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] ethan;#0003
it turns off when u leave


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] Polk#1596
we can do everything as we please then


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] Fraux#7971
oh ur talking about ur server


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] courtney#5125
then whats the point of the jump if ur not changing anything at all


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] katie#0200
i make an :m announcement saying im modding and will be back in a few mins when i leave to mod


[05-Sep-20 03:04 PM] courtney#5125
^


[05-Sep-20 03:05 PM] ethan;#0003
@impact i dmed u this ideas a few weeks ago


[05-Sep-20 03:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well if we give mod to the mrs then seniors dont really have to get admin do they?


[05-Sep-20 03:05 PM] Fraux#7971
no mod to MRs


[05-Sep-20 03:05 PM] Fraux#7971
i dont like that


[05-Sep-20 03:05 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
my mic broke


[05-Sep-20 03:05 PM] courtney#5125

[05-Sep-20 03:06 PM] Polk#1596
we have many rogue heads and managements


[05-Sep-20 03:06 PM] courtney#5125
and what happens when cbs get head


[05-Sep-20 03:06 PM] Polk#1596
very few seniors, they are the only ones that get mod at the tc and ic


[05-Sep-20 03:07 PM] courtney#5125
i dislike the idea of managers and heads getting automatic mod


[05-Sep-20 03:07 PM] Fraux#7971
same


[05-Sep-20 03:08 PM] ethan;#0003
yes


[05-Sep-20 03:08 PM] ethan;#0003
we should do that


[05-Sep-20 03:08 PM] ethan;#0003
idk why we dont do that already


[05-Sep-20 03:08 PM] ethan;#0003

[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Polk#1596
1k subs isnt it


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] courtney#5125

[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] anna#0004

[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Polk#1596

[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yes 1k subs


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] katie#0200

[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
lets do 5k


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Polk#1596
but i dont mind it


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] ethan;#0003
it should be 1k subs or high quality bloxton content


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Fraux#7971
Let's double it at minimum


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
5k is pretty hard


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] ethan;#0003
like Flyro has really high quality bloxton videos


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Fraux#7971
25 THOUSAND


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Polk#1596
25K


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
i think he meant 2500


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] katie#0200
becuse i think flyro has 2 channels, the one with all of his roblox and bloxton content only has like 150 subs and his other one that is unrelated to roblox has a little less than 1k


[05-Sep-20 03:12 PM] ethan;#0003
he has 950 subs i think


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] courtney#5125
and ONLY ppl with that amount of subs can have it. hrs cant have it without the number, flyro cant have it, random popular lrs and mrs cant have it, etc


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Polk#1596
no bloo he meant 25k


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] ethan;#0003
LOL


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
me he asked cuz he has 900+ subs or whatever


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Fraux#7971
someone remove it he aint met the requirements!


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Polk#1596
make it 3.8k so i can qualify


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
ok but what youtuber do we know in bloxton that has 25k


[05-Sep-20 03:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[05-Sep-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
i agree, but baby and bear wont pay u for that


[05-Sep-20 03:24 PM] Polk#1596
they will treat it the same as admin acts


[05-Sep-20 03:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey i dont think they'll agree to it, same situation with the admin acts as polk saidd but ye it'd be nice


[05-Sep-20 03:25 PM] katie#0200

maybe if cyto talks to them about it


[05-Sep-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
shift managers can technically host banning sessions


[05-Sep-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
you need a GM+ supervising


[05-Sep-20 03:25 PM] Polk#1596
thats all


[05-Sep-20 03:26 PM] katie#0200
my computer was broken and i just managed to fix it before this meeting so i wasn't able to host a lot of banning sessions before


[05-Sep-20 03:26 PM] Polk#1596
yeah thats true, but idk


[05-Sep-20 03:26 PM] katie#0200
it does take up a lot of time


[05-Sep-20 03:27 PM] Polk#1596
if ur able to get them to pay u that would be awesome


[05-Sep-20 03:27 PM] katie#0200

[05-Sep-20 03:28 PM] ethan;#0003
that means she has another account banned

ava #9392


[05-Sep-20 03:28 PM] katie#0200
maybe we should only get paid when its a certain amount of bans, because technically a banning session can be hosted when theres only like 100 cards and yet if they got paid for it it would be the same for 1200 bans


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
@stacey That means she has another account that is banned


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
i agree katie


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
if baby and bear agrees to paying we will work something out


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
oop


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
well SORRY


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] Polk#1596
ok


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] Fraux#7971
@katie Criteria could be management board should be almost full or atleast full


[05-Sep-20 03:29 PM] katie#0200
ya so at least 600 bans


[05-Sep-20 03:30 PM] Fraux#7971
Yes

[05-Sep-20 03:30 PM] Fraux#7971
Can someone specify "admin acts" for me


[05-Sep-20 03:30 PM] stacey#1000
Admin acts, firing people, banning people

Also banning sessions are only hosted when the manager board is full and onto overflow board.

[05-Sep-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
i like messing with trello boards, so ive been wanting to clean up the management board (maybe senior and app board as well) to make it easier to understand for managements. kinda like i did with the training schedule and make it look nice! most importantly, it really bugs me how theres individual cards just to say "dont change the background"... not needed! also theres cards made by rein 4 years ago that dont really make much sense, we are no longer 25K member hilton hotels in 2016


[05-Sep-20 03:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
except a few


[05-Sep-20 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
still functional but i want to update them to their fullest potentional


[05-Sep-20 03:33 PM] katie#0200

@Polk backgound for training board could be like the hotel


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Fraux#7971
not board


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Fraux#7971
that would be cute


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
i want to basically archive the whole list of general notices and announcements, we can make that much more organized


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] courtney#5125
yeah polk makes a good point! the hr board looked a LOTTT better after polk cleaned it up. itd be awesome if the same could be done with our other boards too


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Fraux#7971
i agree


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
and we can think about whether or not we want to add new lists


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
and/or archive


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Polk#1596
and yes i agree @Fraux


[05-Sep-20 03:34 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 03:35 PM] Fraux#7971

[05-Sep-20 03:35 PM] Polk#1596

aka u get a temp email and use it on that LOL


[05-Sep-20 03:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
OK SO WHAT I WANT TO BRING UP: review the punishment for major spamming within staff. Some people get fired and banned for just simply spamming something as a joke. For example: they would say "a" 6 times and they just get fired ****and banned**** which is extremely harsh and can just be punished via a suspension. We should review the policy so the punishment for major spamming is only harsh if it's intentional or massive spam like 15+ messages

i havent done much on it


[05-Sep-20 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
well managements add them to fire and ban requests, so unless the hr checks the ban requests they could get suspended and banned without the hr knowing. so what we should do is let the managements know and define what type of punishment they should get depending on what they spam and how many times


[05-Sep-20 03:44 PM] Polk#1596
i already did that with the HR board, but yes management board


[05-Sep-20 03:44 PM] Polk#1596

[05-Sep-20 10:26 PM] courtney#5125
a lot of mrs seemed to be bothered and upset by it


[05-Sep-20 10:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
upset about a office?


[05-Sep-20 10:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
upset about a vc?


[05-Sep-20 10:33 PM] courtney#5125
no


[05-Sep-20 10:33 PM] courtney#5125
managers+ are able to see bot logs, so they were able to see the message that was sent in the office

alright


[05-Sep-20 10:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If I'm not mistaken, I believe dyno has a exemption thing you prob could put a future channel on.


[05-Sep-20 10:44 PM] courtney#5125
but why would a channe like that ever be needed


[05-Sep-20 10:44 PM] courtney#5125
all of our mrs opinions are equally needed and valued. there should never be a time where we need to talk to only a select few because we believe they can provide better input than others


[05-Sep-20 10:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I'm not saying that type of channel.


[05-Sep-20 10:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I feel all the MRs opinions should be equally valued.


[05-Sep-20 10:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but if there was a classified discussion channel somewhere..then you should check the dyno panel for an exemption list.


[05-Sep-20 10:47 PM] courtney#5125
ah

I like how he puts his name on it..so if yall were to submit that to court


[05-Sep-20 10:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
idk then maybe they'll try to bring up something like it could of been doctored


[05-Sep-20 10:52 PM] impact#0297
@KjRBLX @courtney honestly no idea why I did that office, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want everyone to access it like polks and bonnies


[05-Sep-20 10:54 PM] courtney#5125
yeah that makes sense. just that what was said in the channel seemed like major favoritism towards a select few mrs


[05-Sep-20 10:56 PM] impact#0297
i honestly have no favouritism other than people who bring good ideas to the table (like you today)


[05-Sep-20 10:56 PM] impact#0297
I find the merit in people who provide good suggestions and providing them the platform to do so

And as much as I like to think people are smart here, sometimes I have to ask MR‚Äôs for their frontline stance on issues/ideas


[05-Sep-20 11:00 PM] courtney#5125
ya i get that, it makes sense. some mrs have better ideas than others, but we're all still a team here and everyones opinion is valid, however useful it is or isnt


[05-Sep-20 11:00 PM] courtney#5125
but i understand what u were trying to do


[05-Sep-20 11:02 PM] impact#0297
I will just conduct my operations in private instead of groupchat.

Ur most likely to get more correct using 1 letter to guess than just random choices.

She‚Äôs active but friends with about 4 people that are highly involved with trash talking Bloxton and are CBs

Stella, Rack, etc


[08-Sep-20 10:03 PM] stacey#1000
Don‚Äôt want to promote someone to Mr then have to terminate them for their involvement with cbs like we did with gotmestartcd


[08-Sep-20 10:03 PM] Fraux#7971
thanks ma'am! wanted to check and see if she was still involved! such a shame


[08-Sep-20 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
Just look at her roblox friends list


[08-Sep-20 10:05 PM] stacey#1000

@High Rank emi automatically gets to promote one of the seniors as she hasn't been able to promote one yet. if you're interested in being the other person who promotes please dm me with the last senior u promoted and the date of the promotion.


[11-Sep-20 06:52 PM] stacey#1000
if you need a senior promo guide let me know

[11-Sep-20 07:10 PM] stacey#1000
its like 5am for her


[11-Sep-20 07:11 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i see her nearly every time i host, and if u search her name up on trello, u can see her marked down for attendance everyday for weeks


[11-Sep-20 07:11 PM] Tattoblue#5828
i see her a lot


[11-Sep-20 07:12 PM] stacey#1000
she usually does something every day

fun fact: i have now sent 65,255 messages in this chat! this means im 1st place for amount of messages sent.

@courtney Honestly, connor has had a lot of issues in the past months, i think he got suspended before but... yikes


[12-Sep-20 02:16 PM] courtney#5125
he was just being plain rude in general, and he was having such a fit when everyone tried to work it out with him. definitely not behavior expected from a manager, especially one thats been in that position for a while. hence why i want your opinions to decide a consequence for him, if any


[12-Sep-20 02:18 PM] anna#0004
id say verbal warning or something just to remind him of his maturity since that seems a little unprofessional of him


[12-Sep-20 02:19 PM] courtney#5125
ill put a vote


[12-Sep-20 02:21 PM] Fraux#7971

[12-Sep-20 02:23 PM] anna#0004
i was thinking a verbal warning just to remind him of his behaviour but since hes had past issues, he clearly needs something a little more so id say formal or something, not sure if it would go so far as a suspension tho


[12-Sep-20 02:24 PM] courtney#5125
i mean ig its one thing to be salty towards the other managers... but to go off on the lrs in general..? he 1. tried to declare is "superiority" 2. told them that they shouldnt ask questions abt reports bc it annoys him 3. and he kept trying to undermine every thing the managers told him


[12-Sep-20 02:24 PM] Fraux#7971
Ik that's ridiculous to m


[12-Sep-20 02:24 PM] Fraux#7971
e


[12-Sep-20 02:26 PM] anna#0004
i mean as a manager or basically just as an mr ur expected to help out the lrs if theyre unsure on something, so if them asking a simple report question annoys him then..


[12-Sep-20 02:27 PM] courtney#5125
exactlyyyy


[12-Sep-20 02:27 PM] courtney#5125

Greetings connorg2404,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've received a formal warning at Bloxton Hotels as of September 12th, 2020 at 3:45 PM CST. The reasoning behind your formal warning is due to rudeness, unprofessionalism, and disrespect to others in our Discord server. Behavior of this demeanor is by no means necessary, as someone in your position should be behaving as a role model to lower ranking users. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we feel it necessary to issue a formal warning in an effort to remind you of your wrongdoings. We ask you take this formal warning as a reminder and work towards improvement in the future to prevent any further implications. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Best regards,

ccandvy
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

[13-Sep-20 02:29 PM] courtney#5125
i mean shes on a notice but she hasnt even been online or anything for quite a whileeeee :/


[13-Sep-20 02:29 PM] ethan;#0003
she has the 2nd least ammount of comments on her checklist


[13-Sep-20 02:29 PM] ethan;#0003
and he has been here since may


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
This is why I added Doqee to inactive list


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] courtney#5125
yeah shes been a senior for a very long time, and some of our newest seniors even have more than her


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
people who have been here for a month or 2 have double that


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] courtney#5125
yeahhhhh whats up with Doqee now? was he sent his notice yet??


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Doq put himself on an inactivity notice last week


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
He didn‚Äôt make a notice until we told him


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] courtney#5125
was he ever sent the notice?


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] courtney#5125
yeah plus hes always been extremely  unhelpful


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] courtney#5125
hes just dead weight to the senior team :/


[13-Sep-20 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
He had no notice for like a month


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
No cause the day I was going to he put his notice up so what was the point can‚Äôt tell him to improve if he put himself inactive


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs always on roblox is the point


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] impact#0297
I'm asking all the people who did not attend to send me a written reason as to why they could not attend


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] courtney#5125
and hes constantly online (green status) but still refuses to help out when we ask for hosts in senior lounge


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] impact#0297
I will post the responses here


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] courtney#5125
alright ryan


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
Inactive notice means not active on roblox


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
But he‚Äôs still active on roblox so

yeah hes always playing games


[13-Sep-20 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
His notice is invalid


[13-Sep-20 02:32 PM] ethan;#0003
He shouldnt even have a chance to improve activity


[13-Sep-20 02:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
but is there a rule that if your on an inactive notice you can‚Äôt be on Roblox?


[13-Sep-20 02:32 PM] courtney#5125
creating a notice just now doesnt justify months without work. hes only taking up a spot on the senior team and hes like dead weight


[13-Sep-20 02:32 PM] ethan;#0003
He is online 24/7


[13-Sep-20 02:32 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, he gets pings, hes on green


[13-Sep-20 02:32 PM] ethan;#0003
On discord, playing games on his pc and on roblox

but hes not doing those things


[13-Sep-20 02:33 PM] courtney#5125
even tho he is available


[13-Sep-20 02:33 PM] impact#0297
I did not include Maddy or Qu, I know they are sleeping in Australia and they gave me notice


[13-Sep-20 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
An inactive notice means you can‚Äôt be active on roblox. It‚Äôs not an excuse not to do stuff.


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
You can‚Äôt put in a notice and then be playing roblox for hours a day to get out of it


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs not fair to others


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] courtney#5125
yeah


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
my only thing with doq is yeah he hasn‚Äôt done stuff but the last time he did something was what August so he was only considered ‚Äúinactive‚Äù for 3 weeks. Now that‚Äôs not to say that‚Äôs good but compared to other seniors that we‚Äôve had that havent done stuff for MONTHS


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm not saying to fire him


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm saying to send him the notice still


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] stacey#1000
Because


[13-Sep-20 02:34 PM] courtney#5125
he should be sent that notice tho if he hasnt already been sent it


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
He had no inactive notice for a month


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] courtney#5125
cerating a notice doesnt justify months of doing absolutely nothing


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] ethan;#0003
Doge has had too many chances


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] courtney#5125
*creating


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] courtney#5125
agreed with ethan


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
Even when he was active


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
He didn‚Äôt do much


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] ethan;#0003
If he doesnt understand that he needs to be active, at this point there is no harm in just firing him


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] ethan;#0003
he brings nothing to the senior management team


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] ethan;#0003
except holding a spot from someone who disserves the rank


[13-Sep-20 02:35 PM] courtney#5125
i mean, really, he never has been very beneficial to the senior team. at this point hes only taking up a spot for a deserving manager


[13-Sep-20 02:36 PM] courtney#5125
lets say he was fired for inactivity. its not like it would have any impact whatsoever on our senior team, he doesnt do anything


[13-Sep-20 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
This whole thing reminds me of the Darren situation


[13-Sep-20 02:38 PM] stacey#1000
But we can‚Äôt fire him


[13-Sep-20 02:38 PM] impact#0297
We can surely fire him. If needed, I can do the announcement and burn my reputation.


[13-Sep-20 02:38 PM] courtney#5125
if i was an lr, i 100% wouldnt even notice doge was gone if we fire him, just sayin


[13-Sep-20 02:38 PM] courtney#5125
hes making no impact whatsoever on our mr team


[13-Sep-20 02:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôll send him the notice but I mean the only thing with that is I‚Äôll tell him that he needs to follow through with what his inactivity notice says which means not playing games 24/7 as we‚Äôve seen and once his notice is up that he has to improve his inactivity. and if nothing is done from there on his part then we need to consider consequences for him which would be demoting him due to his lack of inactivity


[13-Sep-20 02:39 PM] impact#0297

@High Rank Please be advised, check senior lounge for the people who have all been advised to send me a written notice. If any of you see suspicious activity with them on the boards (possible last minute leak) -- please let me know immediately.


[13-Sep-20 02:44 PM] impact#0297
I wouldn't be surprised with Doq

@bonnie591 the two cards u added for a promo are u promoting them cause u didn‚Äôt join the card noob


[13-Sep-20 02:44 PM] stacey#1000
Or do u want someone else to promote and that‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt join the card


[13-Sep-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah they are up for grabs if anyone wants them


[13-Sep-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
just put them up as seniors massively agreed on them


[13-Sep-20 02:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
hi baby!


[13-Sep-20 02:47 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@impact These meetings are not supposed to be mandatory, why are you to formally warn then for not attending? Consequences will not result from a voluntary action.


[13-Sep-20 02:48 PM] impact#0297
I understand that -- but not attending these meetings is a good indication of whether they are inactive or not.


[13-Sep-20 02:48 PM] impact#0297
I don't even care about the responses -- I'm curious if they even check the fucking chat in which they were tagged in.. to send me a message.


[13-Sep-20 02:49 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Some people might not have seen your message or missed a day due to some emergency, etc. They are not expected to always show up. Again, these meetings are *voluntary* meaning they are **not** required to attend. The performance of our staff is not to be determined by some voluntary meetings.


[13-Sep-20 02:50 PM] impact#0297
Baby -- nobody will be demoted from not attending these meetings. We can agree there. The point that I'm trying to make is to see whether or not they actually check the chat.. there is one senior manager right now who didn't attend.. and her last message sent to the Discord server was back in August..


[13-Sep-20 02:50 PM] impact#0297
That's obviously a problem.. having someone who hasn't checked chats since August.. little concerning


[13-Sep-20 02:51 PM] impact#0297
And it's worth a broader conversation with that person, such as their situation or school.. and work with them on it.


[13-Sep-20 02:51 PM] babymariobebe#7563
You said written notice or *consequences*, if this is an empty threat you should not be making false promises like that. @impact Yes, but dont make the reason being that she didnt attend the meetings, standard inactivity is a much better reason.


[13-Sep-20 02:52 PM] impact#0297
Oh I see what you are saying. You don't like how I worded it.


[13-Sep-20 02:52 PM] impact#0297
K I will fix ti


[13-Sep-20 02:53 PM] impact#0297
Also, while I have your attention, please check the recommendations for fall/halloween update & HR pay model review @babymariobebe


[13-Sep-20 03:02 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@here alright so just to let everyone know, the meetings cyto hosts are voluntary, and you are not allowed to warn anybody for not attending. Please do let the Seniors know that. Obviously it looks better on people if they do attend and we encourage it, but dont hold absence against anyone.


[13-Sep-20 03:05 PM] impact#0297

although the meeting was voluntary anyway so he didnt *have* to go, he was actually active on the discord and talking in general discussion during it thats why im just confused how he didnt see the ping or anything but ya ig he can just ask another senior


[13-Sep-20 03:37 PM] courtney#5125
right, just like anna said. it obviously wasnt a required thing, but if his excuse was being "busy", thats a complete lie. he was playing the game "Among Us" the entire time


[13-Sep-20 03:38 PM] courtney#5125

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been terminated from your position as **9 | Head of Services** from Bloxton Hotels as of **2:50 PM EST 9/14/2020**.

As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately only feel it necessary to dismiss you from your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

[14-Sep-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
Omg we found the head that was leaking!! He was bst too and there was a bst head that was leaking


[14-Sep-20 03:20 PM] stacey#1000
So it was him


[14-Sep-20 03:50 PM] ethan;#0003
i really cant see imag ever being an hr


[14-Sep-20 03:50 PM] ethan;#0003
she has been a senior for so long


[14-Sep-20 03:50 PM] ethan;#0003
but she cant just remember the smallest things


[14-Sep-20 03:50 PM] ethan;#0003
like to kick a cb.....


[14-Sep-20 03:50 PM] ethan;#0003
she waited for me to respond before kicking bypassers at interviews


[14-Sep-20 03:53 PM] courtney#5125
she asks the simplest of questions


[14-Sep-20 03:53 PM] courtney#5125
kinda just seems like she cant do anything independently. a few weeks ago she told me at training at someone failed for lack of grammar and she asked what to do with them :/


[14-Sep-20 03:54 PM] courtney#5125
if she cant complete duties by herself, doubtful she'll be able to lead and teach others how to do them


[14-Sep-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
She also keeps messaging me to host banning sessions


[14-Sep-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
Or tells me to tell other HRs to host one


[14-Sep-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
Like it will get done and I don‚Äôt have all the time to do it.


[14-Sep-20 03:57 PM] stacey#1000
She just tries telling me what to do and it‚Äôs annoying


[14-Sep-20 03:58 PM] stacey#1000
Reasons why she ain‚Äôt an hr right now


[14-Sep-20 05:09 PM] stacey#1000
Clearing bans right now, but I am not clearing suspensions/firings since bans are priority right now and need to be cleared


[14-Sep-20 05:10 PM] stacey#1000
Got a good handful of seniors to assist so thats good


[14-Sep-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125
@stacey well if its a really common occurance i say yes


[14-Sep-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125
we cant ban ppl if theyve never joined the game :/


[14-Sep-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
I declined a few reports


[14-Sep-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125
if they have an inappropriate username then thats not our problem, its roblox's


[14-Sep-20 05:42 PM] courtney#5125
unless they join our games


[14-Sep-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
ill prepare an announcement if more people agree its needed


[14-Sep-20 05:43 PM] courtney#5125

[14-Sep-20 06:13 PM] stacey#1000

We need to make an announcement to mrs telling them what is appropriate and what is inappropriate because  I‚Äôve seen way too many times things like this are posted in SL asking if ‚Äúthis is inappropriate‚Äù


[15-Sep-20 07:10 AM] xM_inn#2821
I don't understand how they can even think that's inappropriate


[15-Sep-20 07:53 AM] stacey#1000
Kk I‚Äôll prepare an announcement for managers


[15-Sep-20 10:36 AM] bonnie591#0591

@ethan; was it roblox issue or exploiters?

@courtney yeah i was just ab to announce that, hes being rlly rude


[15-Sep-20 03:57 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, he doesn‚Äôt even deserve the right to be mad over being banned on accident. it was a mistake, clearly, but he goes on to literally be a brat abt everything :/


[15-Sep-20 03:58 PM] anna#0004
yeah i just spoke to him in dms about it as he just got unbanned so no need to start being rude to the seniors plus i think amira joined in at one point


[15-Sep-20 03:59 PM] anna#0004
and this is what he said lol

ok his response doesn‚Äôt justify anything. his ban was a complete accident and he‚Äôs blowing the whole thing wayyyy out of proportion


[15-Sep-20 04:00 PM] courtney#5125
ok 5 votes woo

to be fair, the things he was saying were enough to ban him anyway since he was being really rude


[15-Sep-20 04:13 PM] anna#0004
i think that was forgotten about then


[15-Sep-20 04:38 PM] courtney#5125
oh he was never banned..?


[15-Sep-20 04:39 PM] courtney#5125

can we ban him then


[15-Sep-20 04:49 PM] courtney#5125
his behavior in general was awful, trash talking in a cb server is bad too. and I doubt he‚Äôs stopped trash talking, especially after his former role being removed


[15-Sep-20 04:49 PM] Fraux#7971

tony is telling me if i delete the video i will get a psb


[16-Sep-20 01:15 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Sep-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
honestly


[16-Sep-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
they'll probably of taken a back-up recording of it


[16-Sep-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan;


[16-Sep-20 03:17 PM] xM_inn#2821

[16-Sep-20 03:17 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Sep-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
@katie ive told people MANY TIMES


[16-Sep-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
not do say the names


[16-Sep-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003
they want to change to


[16-Sep-20 03:31 PM] ethan;#0003

[16-Sep-20 03:32 PM] Fraux#7971

@KjRBLX whatd u do


[16-Sep-20 03:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
idk but i have a bad feeling about giving lollypop and luckyshamrock talkative.


[16-Sep-20 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
@katie I mean they shouldn‚Äôt really be saying their usernames they want like that because anyone could take it.  But yeah that‚Äôs concerning but nothing we can do if we don‚Äôt know who it is.


[16-Sep-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
Like when I‚Äôve changed my username I don‚Äôt tell it to people unless they are my close friends so they won‚Äôt take my username


[16-Sep-20 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
Sharing it in even staff lounge with over 100 people I mean, yeah someone could take it.


[16-Sep-20 04:04 PM] ethan;#0003
the only two people i could think it being is uni or lee


[16-Sep-20 04:05 PM] ethan;#0003
because from what im looking at in the chat he thought it was funny


[16-Sep-20 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
It could be uni if she‚Äôs close friends with cbs and could‚Äôve done it after telling them


[16-Sep-20 04:26 PM] impact#0297

[16-Sep-20 04:50 PM] KjRBLX#2053
he should try futuretops or tryhardtops


[16-Sep-20 04:51 PM] katie#0200
Yeah @stacey I reminded them not to state username ideas in sl for that reason but still the statuses are not okay eek


[16-Sep-20 04:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i thought it was just known not to say what your new name might be unless it was like ur close friends.


[16-Sep-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
@katie users suspect its zylocian


[16-Sep-20 05:39 PM] stacey#1000
I recommend suspending him for questioning if approval from a BOD is given


[16-Sep-20 05:42 PM] stacey#1000
thats aivdan and hes close with gotmestartcd, thats close with CBs and rumours going around hes the one that leaked stuff from SL before


[16-Sep-20 05:43 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn permission to suspend for questioning?


[16-Sep-20 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
I think you gave me approval to suspend him before


[16-Sep-20 06:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
sure

[16-Sep-20 09:30 PM] impact#0297
Is she banned from the discord


[16-Sep-20 09:32 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@impact no


[16-Sep-20 09:33 PM] impact#0297

[16-Sep-20 09:35 PM] impact#0297
banned her


[16-Sep-20 11:11 PM] courtney#5125
yeah I terminated her and she‚Äôs held this ‚Äúgrudge‚Äù ever since üòÇ


[16-Sep-20 11:54 PM] impact#0297
good


[16-Sep-20 11:55 PM] impact#0297
telling someone to kill themselves is fucking disgraceful


[17-Sep-20 09:31 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I could of swore she said she was quitting roblox and going to do art career or something?


[17-Sep-20 09:34 AM] KjRBLX#2053
And polk said she contributed to the hate for vedom in the cb server


[17-Sep-20 09:36 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Like why after all this time u still worried about a virtual hotel, do better.


[17-Sep-20 09:36 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Wasnt it a vote to dismiss her too?


[17-Sep-20 09:53 AM] courtney#5125
yeah thats why she was terminated. she was encouraged cbs, trash-talked, behaved inappropriately, and she was talking abt hoping vedom dies


[17-Sep-20 09:55 AM] courtney#5125
@Polk could u approve the cards on the hr board that have 5+ votes, please?


[17-Sep-20 10:16 AM] xM_inn#2821
hello HRs!

but only for HR use


[17-Sep-20 02:43 PM] ethan;#0003
the whois command for it shows past usernames


[17-Sep-20 02:43 PM] ethan;#0003
so if someone changes there discord tag


[17-Sep-20 02:43 PM] ethan;#0003
it logs it


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] ethan;#0003
when and where and who was it sent to directly


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] ethan;#0003
and also


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
My thoughts on #hr-announcements: Seems unmaliciously leaked, but irresponsible.


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] ethan;#0003
i found more evienece suporting acecuria is claire


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
It was sent in general discussion by some random person.


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@ethan; can u dm me it


[17-Sep-20 02:54 PM] xM_inn#2821
But Connor's name is highlighted, meaning it originated from Connor.


[17-Sep-20 02:58 PM] anna#0004
but we‚Äôve had a few issues with connor recently so if it was intended then wouldnt be too surprising


[17-Sep-20 02:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
id say suspension


[17-Sep-20 03:16 PM] xM_inn#2821
How many times has connor been suspended


[17-Sep-20 03:16 PM] xM_inn#2821

[17-Sep-20 03:18 PM] ethan;#0003
but i think he was warned 1 time before also


[17-Sep-20 03:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
ig 1 more suspension after this then fire?


[17-Sep-20 03:19 PM] ethan;#0003
we still follow that rule?


[17-Sep-20 03:21 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 @xM_inn what should we do about what i put in #hr-announcements


[17-Sep-20 03:22 PM] ethan;#0003
i think that is enough evidence to fire adding on to the other stuff


[17-Sep-20 03:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
they account sharing?


[17-Sep-20 03:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
we dont really but 3 suspensions isnt really the best


[17-Sep-20 03:23 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[17-Sep-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003
this was sent to tatto


[17-Sep-20 03:29 PM] ethan;#0003

[17-Sep-20 03:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@ethan; @Tattoblue I think if anything y‚Äôall should try to get her to admit it


[17-Sep-20 03:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
cause you got the evidence


[17-Sep-20 03:41 PM] ethan;#0003
idk if it will be that easy


[17-Sep-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez if we investigate her, she will know we found out, then probaly start taking images to leak of mr information


[17-Sep-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
or i mean if we


[17-Sep-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
like question her


[17-Sep-20 03:45 PM] ethan;#0003
and try to get her to admit it


[17-Sep-20 03:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
that‚Äôs why you would suspend her first.


[17-Sep-20 03:49 PM] ethan;#0003

So uh


[17-Sep-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
Imag is going out of her way to DM Emma to try to get information regarding who‚Äôs leaking. I never told her to do that and I don‚Äôt know where she thought it was okay to do that


[17-Sep-20 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
Like Emma won‚Äôt know anything


[17-Sep-20 04:11 PM] stacey#1000

thats why i suspended nicole, but they verified as a different acc later. plus, in that screenshot, they have the unverified role, meaning they didnt verify on her account. they havent pretended to be her tho

@Bloo_Berriez im able to see that her only limited on her account she USD bought


[17-Sep-20 07:33 PM] ethan;#0003
because the previous owner is a bacon hair that had 200k rap and 0 the next day and is now terminated

last night tatto dmed me and said earlier in the day he saw claire and aceiura online listening to spotify both listening to different songs


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
hm okay


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
well


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'm going to have her screenshare her dms with claire


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] ethan;#0003
other then that all evidence is against her


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
if they really talk so much, then that'll prove so


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] ethan;#0003
she will say that they talk on snapchat


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] ethan;#0003
just watch


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
lol ik


[18-Sep-20 12:01 PM] xM_inn#2821
But i still wanna see


[18-Sep-20 12:02 PM] ethan;#0003
i was going to ask her to send images of dms with claire, but i didnt know if that was an invasion of personal privacy

[18-Sep-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
this means she did have ownership at one point


[18-Sep-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
sooo


[18-Sep-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
idk


[18-Sep-20 12:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
Let's wait and see


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] ethan;#0003
it could be her lying


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] ethan;#0003
and then her friend says "oh oops"


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
@ethan; Problem with images; gives her time to manipulate


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] ethan;#0003
as she remembers she shouldnt say that


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
If it's live on screenshare


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
she can't do anything


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah


[18-Sep-20 12:04 PM] xM_inn#2821
Either way she had ownership of the account at one point, whether it be currently or not, so that's something we can use against her


[18-Sep-20 12:05 PM] ethan;#0003
And im pretty sure 3 or more mrs know about it


[18-Sep-20 12:05 PM] ethan;#0003

@High Rank @Strategic Advisor there's only 2 managements; holly and louisa. it's obvious it isnt going to be louisa as she's very new. would y'all not rather wait until later tonight and/or tomorrow so that it can be more surprising for holly rather than it being 100% obvious she's getting senior?


[18-Sep-20 05:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
we've already all joined its very obvious that its her even if we wait but you're the promoter minn, its up to you there's no rush just try and get it done by sunday evening


[18-Sep-20 05:16 PM] anna#0004
true but isnt it a little too late since like so many hrs r here


[18-Sep-20 05:17 PM] xM_inn#2821

[18-Sep-20 05:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
and then


[18-Sep-20 05:17 PM] xM_inn#2821
i'd surprise my promoting her straight afterwards as well


[18-Sep-20 05:17 PM] bonnie591#0591

[18-Sep-20 05:17 PM] anna#0004

@Hilton Founder The hotel is really really really laggy. It's not just me, its many other MRs informing me about it. I just went there to try to take a photo and froze a lot and had to force quit things. At first I could close discord and be fine with no lag, but now it got worse and is still laggy when I go there. I won't be able to host banning sessions anymore with that bad of lag freezing every few seconds.

oof i feel like some ppl r not being very inclusive rn.. most ppl only are congratulating armani and holly in their status. idk just my opinion

Suggestions regarding Discord member rights
Greetings readers, this won‚Äôt be a fancy document however, it came to my attention that honestly MRs have a lot more rights than the rest of the Discord server members. As there may be a lot of formers here, they keep hinting regarding MRs having a lot of freedom, trash talkin...
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/DwxIoarKDzErXgCBWCD2cc4lzcSeqrK-3_G6IExU1WE/https/lh3.googleusercontent.com/n0Com0ubVGJ19lS6z6fqQoVuvmVKDvcNzVfmFzm2RRp8vKTV_QEwjV59sYeH01-7ykFVccpZYw%3Dw1200-h630-p


[19-Sep-20 12:59 PM] Polk#1596
uni basically wants everyone in the server to have equal rights


[19-Sep-20 12:59 PM] Polk#1596
aka mrs wouldnt be allowed to swear in staff lounge


[19-Sep-20 01:32 PM] courtney#5125
kinda funny coming from her considering she‚Äôs one of the main mrs that try to pressure new heads into ‚Äúsaying their first swear word‚Äù in the channel


[19-Sep-20 02:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@stacey was it always like that or has it gotten worse?


[19-Sep-20 02:00 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Not sure why it could be an issue now if it never was one. We haven't updated in a while


[19-Sep-20 02:01 PM] babymariobebe#7563
What type of lag is it and how does it happen? When did it start? Why is everyone reporting the same thing?


[19-Sep-20 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
It was never like that before until like 2-3 weeks ago. I‚Äôve never lagged before. It‚Äôs like after you join the server, the whole game freezes and loads really slow where you can‚Äôt even walk around. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the same for a handful of others where they have issues trying to do a shift because they lag out of the server or their game freezes every few seconds. @babymariobebe


[19-Sep-20 02:43 PM] stacey#1000
I can‚Äôt even really go to the hotel because I lag out.


[19-Sep-20 02:45 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt lag at interviews or trainings just at the hotel


[19-Sep-20 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll go to the hotel and try recording the lag I experience


[19-Sep-20 03:48 PM] impact#0297
@Polk have you responded to uni on that document


[19-Sep-20 03:49 PM] Polk#1596

Trello keeps asking me a million times to confirm my email when it‚Äôs already confirmed so maybe it‚Äôs glitched for her too

can an mr face serious consequences for simply talking about the existence of the mr channels, like saying the channel names. is that considered a termination or is that not reallyyyyy leaking


[20-Sep-20 10:38 PM] Fraux#7971
im not too sure if i remember right, but i thought talking about the channels can‚Äôt get you in trouble but it‚Äôs frowned upon, but obviously u can‚Äôt talk about what‚Äôs in it @courtney


[20-Sep-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
that's what i thought


[20-Sep-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
but


[20-Sep-20 10:39 PM] Fraux#7971
@impact can you refresh on this i remember you talking about it ages ago


[20-Sep-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
well the reporter says they might have more evidence tho so ill have to see


[20-Sep-20 10:39 PM] Fraux#7971
let me double check


[20-Sep-20 10:39 PM] courtney#5125
galaxypixel was telling some1 abt the mr channel names and saying the n word apparently


[20-Sep-20 10:40 PM] courtney#5125
well we cant really reprimand him on that language but ya the mr channels i wasnt sure abt


[21-Sep-20 02:38 AM] impact#0297
@Fraux @courtney honestly I don‚Äôt care if people talk about the EXISTENCE of the channel... but I look for punishment or consequences when they talk about the CONTENTS inside the channel


[21-Sep-20 07:31 AM] courtney#5125
makes sense, thanks!


[21-Sep-20 08:16 AM] stacey#1000
If they say there is a staff lounge they cannot get in trouble for that


[21-Sep-20 08:16 AM] stacey#1000
If they say contents inside the channel. That‚Äôs different


[21-Sep-20 08:17 AM] stacey#1000
Everyone already knows the channels exist

Demoted someone called TheBaconBunch for flooding the wall with hate


[21-Sep-20 01:23 PM] babymariobebe#7563
apparently it was a former trying to waste their time


[21-Sep-20 01:26 PM] stacey#1000
Yikes


[21-Sep-20 01:28 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Interesting though..


[21-Sep-20 01:28 PM] babymariobebe#7563
In-game I checked chat logs just to make sure I wasnt going crazy. They told me and let me know someone had been flooding the wall. It was them.


[21-Sep-20 01:29 PM] babymariobebe#7563
I think they probably recorded me banning them, one of their chats on the group wall said "I'm a former, not on this account though. I know what goes on"


[21-Sep-20 01:29 PM] babymariobebe#7563
lol, watch them try to spin this and say "they banned me for my opinions" when its literally hate speech


[21-Sep-20 01:29 PM] babymariobebe#7563

can sage (vibeskies) receive the former mr role at this time? he was just termed recently sept. 14th


[21-Sep-20 09:21 PM] stacey#1000
He needs to wait a month from the date he was fired


[21-Sep-20 09:21 PM] stacey#1000

lighting isnt changed to suit it


[22-Sep-20 02:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
but the idea is there


[22-Sep-20 02:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
its super cool looking lights


[22-Sep-20 02:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
.


[22-Sep-20 02:31 AM] Beartikal#9760
also we've made the interview center and training center into Fall


[22-Sep-20 07:52 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oo like that idea


[22-Sep-20 10:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey has doqee played other roblox games frequently during his inactive notice


[22-Sep-20 10:10 AM] bonnie591#0591
if hes really active on discord and roblox, we can invalidate the notice


[22-Sep-20 10:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
i think its time we take action on him


[22-Sep-20 10:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
if we was marked inactive, we should of taken action sooner


[22-Sep-20 10:11 AM] bonnie591#0591
he*


[22-Sep-20 10:11 AM] stacey#1000
hes been online on discord a lot, roblox ive seen him a couple times butim also a diff timezone and cant be on all time to check every day


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
ill keep an eye


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] xM_inn#2821
Doqee has had an interesting attitude lately


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
i just see him online on discord a lot


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
and he was inactive for like a month


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
without a notice


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
tbh we need some sort of automatic warning if a senior is marked inactive


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
semi is fine, but inactive should be a letter sent to them and a written warning


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
like hes not even semi-active


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
like hes not even doing one thing


[22-Sep-20 10:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
mhm


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
Dats how it's supposed to be bonnie


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] stacey#1000
other seniors that cant be fully active at least host 1-2 times a week when they can


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] xM_inn#2821
Idk if thats still enforced by bloo though


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] stacey#1000
I added his inactive card


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] stacey#1000
when he had no valid notice


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] bonnie591#0591
@Bloo_Berriez answer dms from last night when u can pls


[22-Sep-20 10:13 AM] stacey#1000
idk if he was sent the inactive letter


[22-Sep-20 10:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
if hes on roblox a lot during his inactive notice we can invalidate it


[22-Sep-20 10:14 AM] xM_inn#2821
I can send doges notice I assume bloo forgot since it's been 2 weeks


[22-Sep-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
what about be online on discord playing among us


[22-Sep-20 10:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
i also recommend changing how we deal with semi and inactive


[22-Sep-20 10:14 AM] bonnie591#0591
how it should go is


[22-Sep-20 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
semi active is not fully inactive because at least they do 1-3 things when they can


[22-Sep-20 10:15 AM] stacey#1000
but they should have a notice if they cant be fully active


[22-Sep-20 10:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
I got an idea for semi and inactive


[22-Sep-20 10:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'll post it once I'm on PC


[22-Sep-20 10:15 AM] stacey#1000
do we have anyone semi active rn


[22-Sep-20 10:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
Hard to keep typing on mobile


[22-Sep-20 10:15 AM] xM_inn#2821
No I dont think bloo updates their statuses on their senior cards


[22-Sep-20 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
megan is only one


[22-Sep-20 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
shes semi active, not getting 100 percent every week but does like 2-3 things when she can but doesnt have a notice


[22-Sep-20 10:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
failure to meet **all checklist items** one week --> semi-inactive --> failure to meet **all checklist items** for a second week and beyond --> inactive

failure to meet **all checklist items** one week --> semi-inactive --> failure to meet **at least half of checklist items** for a second week --> semi-inactive --> failure to meet **all checklist items** the following week --> inactive

each semi and inactive should be given a letter, you are allowed unlimited amount of semi-inactive notices and only 3 inactive notices.

if someone is active for a certain amount of weeks in a row, we could allow an inactive appeal system


[22-Sep-20 10:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey @xM_inn thoughts on above


[22-Sep-20 10:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
3 inactive notices could mean a demotion to management or lr depending on their consistency with activity


[22-Sep-20 10:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
to get out of inactive, you will need to do all checklist items


[22-Sep-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
im confused on the notice part


[22-Sep-20 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
like they cannot have inactive notices anymore and only 3


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] stacey#1000
so like say a senior has a notice


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] stacey#1000
and since they can only make it a month long


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
wait no


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
when i say


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
inactive notices


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
what im meaning is


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
being marked inactive on the card


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
and getting a letter / notice in dms about their inactivity


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
which will count as 1 inactive notice


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
should change the name for that


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
1 inactive letter


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] stacey#1000
but if they have a valid notice they cab be mark as notice still right?


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
yea


[22-Sep-20 10:19 AM] bonnie591#0591
if they got a valid one then thats fine they exempt from that


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] bonnie591#0591
if they inactive without a notice we could follow that system


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] stacey#1000
so like


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] stacey#1000
megan for example


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] stacey#1000
is semi active rn right


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] stacey#1000
does like


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] stacey#1000
idk 2-3 things a week or some weeks nothing


[22-Sep-20 10:20 AM] stacey#1000
and has no notice


[22-Sep-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
so does she get sent an inactive notice?


[22-Sep-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
ive already told her to make an inactive notice if she cant be active


[22-Sep-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
and she says she would be active and is on roblox a lot, and yet she still doesnt get 100 percent and didnt make a notice


[22-Sep-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
so


[22-Sep-20 10:21 AM] bonnie591#0591
yeah so if she only did 2 things a week without a notice, the first week of failing to do **all the items** will result in semi inactive and not a warning but friendly reminder sent to her dms. if she doesn't do at least half of the checklist items the following week without a notice, then its inactive


[22-Sep-20 10:21 AM] stacey#1000
she should be sent a warning


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
ive already told her to put a notice


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] bonnie591#0591
yea


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
shes been like


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] bonnie591#0591
do u think that system above would be good


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] bonnie591#0591
as we're actually enforcing


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] stacey#1000
ya


[22-Sep-20 10:22 AM] bonnie591#0591
ok lets get a vote


[22-Sep-20 10:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
the appeal system is kinda complicated


[22-Sep-20 10:23 AM] xM_inn#2821
I'd say that if u cant meet ur requirements for one week, u can be excused but u must tell an HR before the week ends


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
I think that'd be easier then making people appeal when they could tell us in advance


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
Like they have a whole week to get their requirements


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
But otherwise agreed ya


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] bonnie591#0591
ya we could have like a way where u can dm bloo on sunday if you need to be exempt from the weeks requirement


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
mhm


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
But u need a good reason


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] xM_inn#2821
U can't just be like ugh I cant be bothered


[22-Sep-20 10:24 AM] bonnie591#0591

[22-Sep-20 11:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
tell him he has 2 weeks to improve activity


[22-Sep-20 11:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
he'll be reassessed on the 6th of october


[22-Sep-20 11:57 AM] xM_inn#2821
and if no improvement is made, he'll be subject to demotion


[22-Sep-20 11:58 AM] xM_inn#2821
i think thats fair


[22-Sep-20 12:09 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Sep-20 12:15 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Sep-20 12:18 PM] courtney#5125

[22-Sep-20 04:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What's the protocol for someone who wants to be unbanned for being underaged on discord? Is it a typical just a month wait and they appeal like regular?


[22-Sep-20 05:35 PM] courtney#5125
i believe its still a month!

[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
me and tatto started this investigation on one mr last week because we got some reports that she was a banned user on an alt


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] Fraux#7971
rip I trusted bella


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
and BRO WAS IT CORRECT


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
reading that kinda gave me anxiety.


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
was it a cb


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
bet it was


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@Beartikal a group of MRs were helping a blacklisted former MR


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
do you remember cl2ire


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] Beartikal#9760
ye we banned her


[22-Sep-20 08:33 PM] ethan;#0003
she started drama in the discord


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
aceuria is claire


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760

[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
my heart started racing.


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
Claire came back on an ALT and got MR


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
bella and milo protected her


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
now they're editing evidence and stuff to not get fired


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] xM_inn#2821
it's a bit of a mess, but ultimately they've all messed up massively


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] courtney#5125
hey not to interrupt but somethings up at interviews


[22-Sep-20 08:34 PM] courtney#5125

[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] courtney#5125
ive rejoined twice ya


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
yeah thats a roblox issue


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
admin breaking is a roblox issue how lol


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
when there is server lag and high ping it takes a while for stuff to load in


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
it will load in after a few minutes


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
it shouldnt do that its probably the admin script waiting on something


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
such as a rank check for group


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] courtney#5125
well ive been sitting in this server for like 10 minutes+


[22-Sep-20 08:35 PM] courtney#5125

[22-Sep-20 08:36 PM] RAMMGaming#3022
@xM_inn does the check mean objection or approve of the termination lol


[22-Sep-20 08:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
approve of term!


[22-Sep-20 08:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
@courtney appears that its a Basic admin issue


[22-Sep-20 08:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
ill let the owner of the admin know

[22-Sep-20 08:39 PM] stacey#1000

It was announced to seniors. Then she went and made a tea doc and basically told everyone she was fired


[22-Sep-20 10:54 PM] stacey#1000
And then turned more toxic


[22-Sep-20 10:54 PM] stacey#1000
Throwback that was the last senior termination until now


[22-Sep-20 11:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ace went live in staff vc, and her discord popped up. She says the channels were hidden, the only thing shown was staff lounge. I was watching the stream.


[22-Sep-20 11:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
U can't get in trouble right for like names of channels right? The channel names was not intentional at all.


[22-Sep-20 11:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Trying to teach Jess how to script too, thats the reason she was live.


[22-Sep-20 11:12 PM] stacey#1000
Everyone knows there is a staff lounge


[22-Sep-20 11:12 PM] stacey#1000
So it‚Äôs fine


[22-Sep-20 11:13 PM] stacey#1000
If no contents inside the channel were shown it‚Äôs fine

@High Rank I have disclosed this to Bear & Baby, but I haven't disclosed it to you all. We will not be having meetings this weekend (26th) and next weekend (Oct 3rd) -- take this time to recharge, get some extra work done with school and spend time with families & friends. I will be travelling this weekend, and then will be international on the weekend of the third. I expect you all to have topics for October 10th, and I would love Baby to hear our support for some of the ideas we have recommended to him.

Zylocian should be suspended for questioning

tatto u could tell him something false about the terminations


[23-Sep-20 02:52 PM] xM_inn#2821
And if it's leaked.. we know it's him


[23-Sep-20 02:55 PM] stacey#1000

He could've also seen those pictures in the staff lounge, I believe they were sent there. but, Idk why he asked those questions because in the announcement, min was pretty clear about why they got terminated


[23-Sep-20 03:01 PM] stacey#1000

u cant just promote them, ask them hey can u open ur inv before we go over rules, then take their promo away bc their sus


[23-Sep-20 04:26 PM] courtney#5125
*theyre


[23-Sep-20 04:26 PM] ethan;#0003
We tell them that it‚Äôs a requirement for when an mr gets promoted the hr promoting needs to look through the inventory


[23-Sep-20 04:27 PM] courtney#5125
so promote them, tell them to open their inventory before u do rules, then if theyre suspcious we just dont promote them?

[23-Sep-20 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
Why tho


[23-Sep-20 04:32 PM] stacey#1000

[23-Sep-20 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs been like


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
3 months of us meaning to suspend him


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
For questioning


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
I'd rather wait a few more days and get solid evidence than suspend instantly and risk not finding anything out


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
He might not say anything tho


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
Give it 24 hours


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
If nothing happens


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] xM_inn#2821
Then u can suspend


[23-Sep-20 04:33 PM] impact#0297

Wasn‚Äôt she fired or did she resign


[23-Sep-20 04:35 PM] impact#0297
don't know don't care


[23-Sep-20 04:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
I think she resigned


[23-Sep-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
Are you taking mod‚Äôs role too


[23-Sep-20 04:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey Btw when you suspend Zy, add me to the GC for questioning pls


[23-Sep-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to do investigations rn


[23-Sep-20 04:36 PM] stacey#1000
Tattoo agreed to suspend for questioning


[23-Sep-20 04:36 PM] impact#0297
no mod is just dumb


[23-Sep-20 04:36 PM] impact#0297
he can stay


[23-Sep-20 04:37 PM] xM_inn#2821
Ah ok, well just leave it 24 hours before u or Tatto suspend please, so that way there is that short period of time for us to potentially get strong evidence based on the plan


[23-Sep-20 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt mind being in the gc to see and when I‚Äôm on I can ask questions


[23-Sep-20 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
But I won‚Äôt be able to be on for long periods of time


[23-Sep-20 04:39 PM] stacey#1000
We see where it‚Äôs at in 24 hours


[23-Sep-20 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah ok


[23-Sep-20 04:39 PM] xM_inn#2821

[23-Sep-20 05:11 PM] impact#0297
and when I asked "ok which ryan"


[23-Sep-20 05:11 PM] impact#0297
she was like "oh that's mod's business"


[23-Sep-20 05:11 PM] impact#0297
and then I asked "ok why did you post it in general then"


[23-Sep-20 05:12 PM] impact#0297
"oh it's just an inside joke with me and mod"

@stacey should i put dooners promo on hold


[24-Sep-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
Ya


[24-Sep-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
He could be the head that‚Äôs leaking


[24-Sep-20 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs not zylocian I suspect him


[24-Sep-20 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591


[24-Sep-20 03:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok!!


[24-Sep-20 03:46 PM] katie#0200
what about buriedbear @stacey he's a BST head


[24-Sep-20 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
its possible


[24-Sep-20 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
it could be any BST head


[24-Sep-20 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
@katie


[24-Sep-20 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
if its not zylocian


[24-Sep-20 04:29 PM] stacey#1000
then its any other BST one


[24-Sep-20 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
xxdooner is next on the list for suspects after zylo


[24-Sep-20 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn update can we suspend him yet


[24-Sep-20 04:30 PM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue update did he say anything or no one said anything about what u fake told zylo


[24-Sep-20 04:30 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I haven‚Äôt seen anything about it @stacey


[24-Sep-20 04:31 PM] Tattoblue#5828
He hasn‚Äôt dmed me anything since yesterday


[24-Sep-20 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
alright


[24-Sep-20 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
so we should be good to suspend then


[24-Sep-20 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
for questioning


[24-Sep-20 04:31 PM] stacey#1000
the sooner we figured out if its him or not the better


[24-Sep-20 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
so we dont accidentally promote the leaker to management


[24-Sep-20 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
basically I wouldnt promote anyone in bst from head to manager rn


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Min said to wait 24 hours, it‚Äôs been 24 hours so I guess we can suspend him @stacey


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
Management is getting a lot of members as well


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
I really have a bad feeling about xxdoonerxx


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
his acc


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
overall is sus


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
so if its not zylo


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] stacey#1000
Id suspend him next


[24-Sep-20 04:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think we should like promote a bst head to management once every 2 weeks so if leaking suddenly starts we know its them but idk thats risky


[24-Sep-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
btw the former


[24-Sep-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
gamerboy_31001


[24-Sep-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
is highly involved in the cb server


[24-Sep-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
so if he has former role


[24-Sep-20 04:35 PM] stacey#1000
id take it


[24-Sep-20 04:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
U can suspend Zylo yes


[24-Sep-20 04:36 PM] xM_inn#2821

just a heads up that mel (manager, r4ses) needs to be inactive for a bit of time, shes not sure how long, apparently. according to liz, (eriiqn) she had to go pretty quickly and had no way of creating a notice on the trello. not sure whats up, but just thought id let yall know in case someone ended up wondering abt her!

and maybe having a vote open for mrs to give their ideas


[27-Sep-20 05:51 PM] courtney#5125
is that something that could be done?


[27-Sep-20 05:51 PM] ethan;#0003
Year 11 means 11th grade @KjRBLX

[27-Sep-20 05:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Alright, just passing the word along.


[27-Sep-20 05:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
We should just give a reminder about the saying his 12


[27-Sep-20 05:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm year 11 as well üòé


[27-Sep-20 05:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
A whole announcement? or just tell Lee to be careful when saying his school grade?


[27-Sep-20 06:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
No just dm lee


[27-Sep-20 06:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
He said he was 12


[27-Sep-20 06:04 PM] bonnie591#0591
Saying his school grade which was year 11 means his 15 so that bit is fine

He wasn't talking about his school year when he was saying he was 12 sir


[27-Sep-20 06:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
He was talking about age


[27-Sep-20 06:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053

When he said he was 12


[27-Sep-20 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
He was talking about his age


[27-Sep-20 06:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
The second one was him saying he is year 11 in school


[27-Sep-20 06:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053

Doqee fausly reported someone, then refused to respond, or take down the report, and the person probs ggot introuble for something he shouldnt of gotten introuble for because an inactive senior management reported something he should of


[28-Sep-20 08:53 PM] courtney#5125
doge is justtttt pretty awful. hes done nothing beneficial, hes so rude and immature on discord and hes incredibly inactive. hes creating so many more problems than hes solving


[28-Sep-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
@Bloo_Berriez did you ever send doqee the inactive letter


[28-Sep-20 08:53 PM] ethan;#0003
or notice


[28-Sep-20 08:54 PM] Fraux#7971
@courtney oop u joined as i shutdown


[28-Sep-20 08:54 PM] Fraux#7971
what did u need


[28-Sep-20 08:54 PM] courtney#5125
i was just gonna ban the 2 users from interviews that have cards on the mb, i joined a new server to do it tho!!


[28-Sep-20 08:55 PM] Fraux#7971
okk!!


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
Can we just fire him already


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
We already have enough to fire him for inactivity alone


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont think bloo sent the inactive letter yet...


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
He did


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
O


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
And he responded to it


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] ethan;#0003
he didnt put a due date


[28-Sep-20 08:56 PM] stacey#1000
And it was lies


[28-Sep-20 08:57 PM] ethan;#0003
we should ask a BOD if we can take a vote


[28-Sep-20 08:57 PM] ethan;#0003
on firing him


[28-Sep-20 08:57 PM] courtney#5125
yeah he literally just made an excuse and lied that he never plays games


[28-Sep-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000
Doqee says he has no time for roblox with school and yet he‚Äôs seen on roblox all the time


[28-Sep-20 08:57 PM] ethan;#0003

[28-Sep-20 08:57 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:09 PM] ethan;#0003
he still needs to be fired


[28-Sep-20 09:09 PM] stacey#1000
But he is still inactive so keep an eye on him still


[28-Sep-20 09:09 PM] ethan;#0003

[28-Sep-20 09:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

hes created so many more problems than hes ever solved, hes done nothing for the senior or mr team


[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
Ok but here‚Äôs the thing we need evidence of him being on other games and such


[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
minn said to give him 2 weeks to improve his activity so idk if we should use that against him until I believe we gave him until October 5th or something


[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
let me get the message


[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] ethan;#0003

He hasn‚Äôt done anything for activity wise


[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000
I was all for firing him with this report


[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] courtney#5125

[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:10 PM] courtney#5125

[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
It was almost a year ago


[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
nope nothing so far from checklists it was 0%


[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I would of expected at least something but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
Also if we are talking about inactive seniors


[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] courtney#5125
well hes clearly not taking what u said into consideration anyways. its like he wants to be fired


[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000
Can I bring up an inactive senior


[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:11 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
Megan, she hasn‚Äôt really don‚Äôt any shifts or anything unless it‚Äôs my sessions and she wants to co-host or I ask her. She doesn‚Äôt do anything otherwise and she has no valid notice. I have told you to add an inactive notice probably 2-3 times now and she always says she will be more active and she hasn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt add a notice. And I know she‚Äôs been on other roblox games and among us and stuff


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
So she is concerning me


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Oh


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
pfft tatto


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
thats true. didnt she have a notice a few times but kept extending it by a month?


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] Fraux#7971
wasnt she inactive for a long time without having a notice


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] courtney#5125
she kept making empty promises in staff lounge that shed be back "next week"


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
No she had a notice before


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
Then it ended 2 months ago


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] Fraux#7971
i thought her thing was red for like a while


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah Megan is nothing doing much. I was gonna wait for bonnies new update regarding the activity issue before sending her any message


[28-Sep-20 09:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
which is this week


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs been doing this as a senior


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
For a long time


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
So change her nickname then lol


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] stacey#1000
You can change her nickname yknow


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] Fraux#7971
i mean what does that mean


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] courtney#5125
I THOUGHT SHE CHANGED HER ROBLOX USERNAME TO THAT


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] Fraux#7971
like y was it that


[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] courtney#5125

[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] Tattoblue#5828
That‚Äôs not her roblox username?

[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] courtney#5125

[28-Sep-20 09:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] stacey#1000
Ya that‚Äôs not megans fault a former hr changed it and then didn‚Äôt change it back


[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] stacey#1000
And then I forgot about it


[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] stacey#1000
So we can easily change it back


[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] Fraux#7971
noo i was just wondering if it was that for a reason


[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] Fraux#7971

[28-Sep-20 09:15 PM] courtney#5125

her inactivity is concerning to say the least


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
Tell me when‚Äôs the last time Megan hosted for you that was your sesison and not mine


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It fluctuates. like couple weeks ago she had 100% then it dropped down to like 50% then 13%


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] courtney#5125
she has never hosted for me


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
She only got 100% attending my sessions though


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs the thing


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
She only ever goes to mine


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah I don‚Äôt remember the last time she asked me to host


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
And that concerns me


[28-Sep-20 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it‚Äôs been a while


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
I get I‚Äôm good friends with her


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
But it doesn‚Äôt change that she should be hosting for other HRs and not jsut me


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] courtney#5125
i mean its fine if she wants to co-host with u or host for u since ur friends, but she cant just not host for anyone else. thats not activity


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
Not to mention I can‚Äôt host much right now


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey I agree, the last time she hosted for me was in may. If you say she‚Äôs only been hosting your sessions then that‚Äôs host bias as well.. üò≥ idk if she‚Äôs hosted for any of the other hrs tho


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying candy


[28-Sep-20 09:17 PM] stacey#1000
It concerns me


[28-Sep-20 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm on a notice myself now. So if I‚Äôm not hosting anything....is she not going to either....?


[28-Sep-20 09:18 PM] Fraux#7971
while we on the topic of inactivity i weould like to apologize to u all for my recent inactivity üòî school is beating me up with 2 baseball bats


[28-Sep-20 09:18 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well once bonnie implements his new idea for the seniors then she‚Äôll definitely be getting a firm warning regarding it which should be sometime this week so


[28-Sep-20 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
Then she would probably add a notice, play other roblox games and not host


[28-Sep-20 09:19 PM] courtney#5125
ill beat u up with 3 baseball bats @Fraux


[28-Sep-20 09:19 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:19 PM] Fraux#7971

[28-Sep-20 09:20 PM] courtney#5125

[28-Sep-20 09:20 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:20 PM] stacey#1000

[28-Sep-20 09:38 PM] Fraux#7971
we wouldnt do anything right? it isnt really a roblox related server or anything but idk-


[28-Sep-20 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
Uh


[28-Sep-20 09:38 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[28-Sep-20 09:39 PM] Fraux#7971
personally i dont think that falls in our business, as long as they dont like make it known theyre in the server or use bad emojis? but idk


[28-Sep-20 09:40 PM] stacey#1000
Yea I think that is their choice


[28-Sep-20 09:40 PM] Fraux#7971

[28-Sep-20 09:54 PM] Fraux#7971
did tough actually bypass or was that like fake


[28-Sep-20 09:54 PM] Fraux#7971
i forgot


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im not even sure, I did a search I couldn't find it, but it seems based on the seniors comments he did


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
but he wouldve faced consequences if he did


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
and he never did


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Didn't he get suspended once?


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
yeah for aa


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Oh yeah


[28-Sep-20 09:56 PM] courtney#5125
maybe they think he was suspended for bypassing instead of that :/


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
It was fake


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] Fraux#7971
can i comment that the proof of him bypassing was fake


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
The cbs really don‚Äôt like him and try to get him fired a lot


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
They trash talked him a lot when I was in their cb server on an alt


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] courtney#5125
the cbs hate him but hes pretty nice and rlly active


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] stacey#1000
Ya


[28-Sep-20 09:57 PM] Fraux#7971
yes he is very active


[28-Sep-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
He might be ready for manager soon tbh


[28-Sep-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000
If he‚Äôs still a head


[28-Sep-20 09:58 PM] stacey#1000

And they try saying we harass them and act all innocent


[28-Sep-20 09:59 PM] Fraux#7971
ik like damn


[28-Sep-20 10:00 PM] Fraux#7971
i wonder if the harassment the CBs partake in would fall under cyber bullying.. if so the FBI could get involved im pretty sure


[28-Sep-20 10:00 PM] Fraux#7971
and dont think i wont contact an FBI agent üòÑ


[28-Sep-20 10:00 PM] stacey#1000
It is


[28-Sep-20 10:00 PM] stacey#1000

@courtney 0_0


[28-Sep-20 10:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
imma look at dat in a few, but im trying to figure out why kylie can speak in staff music


[28-Sep-20 10:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I mean its not a big deal but its wrong.


[28-Sep-20 10:12 PM] courtney#5125
with chellcoo u mean?


[28-Sep-20 10:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
No. the kyliee being able to speak in staff music


[28-Sep-20 10:13 PM] courtney#5125
ahhh


[28-Sep-20 10:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I even used the discord feature to force her roles onto mine..it said i was suppressed from speaking but apparently shes not


[28-Sep-20 10:13 PM] courtney#5125
everyone else in that channel is server muted, but not her


[28-Sep-20 10:13 PM] KjRBLX#2053
yeah


[28-Sep-20 10:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but i turned server mute on and it server muted her in staff vc too


[28-Sep-20 10:14 PM] courtney#5125
could u server mute her there and get her to rejoin the vc?


[28-Sep-20 10:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053
idk. I just specifically made her permission off to speak and made her rejoin


[28-Sep-20 10:19 PM] courtney#5125
it looks correct now


[28-Sep-20 10:20 PM] courtney#5125
shes server muted and only muted in the channel


[28-Sep-20 10:20 PM] courtney#5125

it‚Äôs one thing to one to have a fun session but it‚Äôs another to make it an hour and a half ordeal, invite random friends into the server, not do their jobs, and just act immature


[29-Sep-20 11:48 AM] ethan;#0003
beucs maddy acts weird sometimes like almost like someone else is on her account


[29-Sep-20 11:49 AM] courtney#5125
im talking abt sessions. I‚Äôm totally ok if she wants to engage everyone and have fun but


[29-Sep-20 11:49 AM] ethan;#0003
wait what do you mean what u said


[29-Sep-20 11:49 AM] courtney#5125
she takes it way too far sometimes, to the point where she completely misses the point of actually hosting


[29-Sep-20 11:49 AM] ethan;#0003
she invited friends to her session and they didnt do anything?


[29-Sep-20 11:50 AM] courtney#5125
she invited farra, willow, mirk, quwanterz, uni,and possibly one other. none of them did anything except for willow


[29-Sep-20 11:50 AM] courtney#5125
they all just came and talked and messed around then left


[29-Sep-20 11:50 AM] courtney#5125
from what I hear madi and mirk were the worst of it


[29-Sep-20 11:52 AM] courtney#5125
it‚Äôs not like mirk is active anyways, pretty much the only time he goes to sessions is when madi hosts


[29-Sep-20 11:54 AM] ethan;#0003
did they join after the session started?


[29-Sep-20 11:54 AM] ethan;#0003
or before it started


[29-Sep-20 11:56 AM] courtney#5125
she slocked numerous times just for them to get in and mess around w her


[29-Sep-20 11:56 AM] courtney#5125
after rules


[29-Sep-20 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
someone from fizze messaged me asking about alliance info e.e


[29-Sep-20 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
that group is


[29-Sep-20 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
just


[29-Sep-20 04:03 PM] ethan;#0003
:uhhh_that_didnt_happen:


[29-Sep-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Never


[29-Sep-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Also Maddy has been suspended so many times her next offence may be a termination


[29-Sep-20 04:10 PM] courtney#5125
ya. i love that she wants to make things fun for everyone but she takes it way too far. normal sessions shouldn‚Äôt be an hour and a half long like that, she shouldn‚Äôt be slocking several times just to let her friends in to mess around, and she should be behaving like an actual host that‚Äôs in charge of the server ://


[29-Sep-20 04:48 PM] stacey#1000
@Tattoblue @xM_inn update on the zylocian investigation?


[29-Sep-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
hes been suspended about a week now


[29-Sep-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
if you dont suspect hes the leaker, have to unsuspend


[29-Sep-20 04:49 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey I interviewed him a couple days ago, he has a lot of DMs with gotme, but no leaking


[29-Sep-20 04:49 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I can‚Äôt unsuspend him rn but if u want to u can


[29-Sep-20 04:49 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I‚Äôm tired of him dming me everyday üò≠ but I don‚Äôt blame him


[29-Sep-20 04:49 PM] stacey#1000
Ill wait for Minns opinion as well


[29-Sep-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
so no actual evidence of him leaking?


[29-Sep-20 04:50 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Nope


[29-Sep-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
alr so then we know its not him


[29-Sep-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
xxdoonerxx is next suspect


[29-Sep-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
has the leaker been going to the hotel or anything or no?


[29-Sep-20 04:50 PM] stacey#1000
like the accs that would go leak SL


[29-Sep-20 04:51 PM] Tattoblue#5828
The last time I heard about the leaker was when the accounts with info of the terminations were made, but nothing since then


[29-Sep-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
he will likely get unsuspended tomorrow, just want to hear minns thoughts and get approval to unsuspend


[29-Sep-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
alr so we should just wait then until someone leaks again


[29-Sep-20 04:51 PM] stacey#1000
nice to know its not zylo at least


[29-Sep-20 04:52 PM] Tattoblue#5828
If he gets unsuspended and suddenly there‚Äôs a leaking incident, we‚Äôll know it‚Äôs him


[29-Sep-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 I recommend not promoted xxdoonerxx at all rn, he is the next suspect and the leaker is not zylo so. well I guess if u did promote him and a manager leaks he would be a suspect


[29-Sep-20 04:52 PM] stacey#1000
yea we would know since there is no leaking since hes been suspended


[29-Sep-20 04:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll just keep it on hold until further notice


[29-Sep-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
I think we should suspend dooner next to question if we continue


[29-Sep-20 04:53 PM] stacey#1000
lets wait and see what happens when zylo gets unsuspended


[29-Sep-20 05:58 PM] xM_inn#2821
@stacey gonna review the interview tatto did with him once more and the I'll make a decision.


[29-Sep-20 05:59 PM] stacey#1000
oki


[29-Sep-20 06:11 PM] xM_inn#2821

[29-Sep-20 07:45 PM] ethan;#0003
im pretty sure all it does is deletes messages


[29-Sep-20 07:46 PM] ethan;#0003
automatically


[29-Sep-20 09:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
the answer is that nobody likes automod


[29-Sep-20 09:48 PM] Beartikal#9760
and we have plenty of "mods" on our discord


[30-Sep-20 01:54 PM] stacey#1000

CAN I MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE SENIORS NOT TO BAN FOR VERY MINIOR THINGS LIKE WE AGREEED ON A MONTH AGO


[30-Sep-20 03:43 PM] ethan;#0003
like if they accidently have a minor curse word in a picture


[30-Sep-20 03:43 PM] ethan;#0003
or a video title


[30-Sep-20 03:43 PM] ethan;#0003
we agreed on that we wouldnt ban them


[30-Sep-20 03:43 PM] ethan;#0003
but we never told seniors

[30-Sep-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez that would be something up to baby and bear I think


[30-Sep-20 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
@ethan; I got it when my friend randomly called me and I had headphones, heard the remix song and it scared the crap out of me. I guess its my ringtone now on discord and i didnt even know it existed till today


[30-Sep-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
right lol @Fraux


[30-Sep-20 04:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey yeah thought so, just couldn‚Äôt find anything about it when we talked about it but yeah I‚Äôll also let baby and bear know


[30-Sep-20 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
ya we got permission from bear to blacklist due to his actions of trashtalking us to a senior that was reported to me so it would be up to them


[30-Sep-20 07:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Ticket bot still down.


[30-Sep-20 07:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[30-Sep-20 07:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053

@High Rank Testing the waters here, would anyone be opposed to a weekend test trial of a Former MR lounge? I'd like to make an announcement in an upcoming press conference


[30-Sep-20 11:31 PM] babymariobebe#7563
@impact We're not doing that


[30-Sep-20 11:31 PM] babymariobebe#7563
They wont want to leave it behind once you 'test the waters'


[30-Sep-20 11:37 PM] impact#0297
What the rationale for not letting them have a chatroom compared to having one for Former HR's?
