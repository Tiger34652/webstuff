@High Rank check staff announcements and senior announcements for the new interview procedure! yes, the one for low account ages!


[02-Mar-21 03:33 PM] Polk#1596
and if u have any suggestions to phrase "threat to the game" in a more generous way, please tell me

its what bear told me and idk how to phrase it differently


[02-Mar-21 03:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The thing is...we werent suppose to kick low acc ages til now? Or we just now making it official


[02-Mar-21 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
technically you werent supposed to cuz it was still being discussed


[02-Mar-21 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
but if u did its no big deal


[02-Mar-21 03:36 PM] Polk#1596
!


[02-Mar-21 03:37 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright :whew: 😓


[02-Mar-21 03:39 PM] lyss#0709
so we just kick people with account ages lower than 15 then? i thought before the plan was for it to be pbanning them @Polk


[02-Mar-21 03:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Why would we pban them?


[02-Mar-21 03:43 PM] lyss#0709
that's just what was mentioned when the idea was brought up in january


[02-Mar-21 03:54 PM] Polk#1596
yeah, seems like i misunderstood @lyss


[02-Mar-21 03:54 PM] Polk#1596
well we were meant to ban


[02-Mar-21 03:55 PM] Polk#1596
but seniors dont have access to that


[02-Mar-21 03:55 PM] Polk#1596
and kicking has the same effect as ban in a slocked server


[02-Mar-21 03:55 PM] Polk#1596
and its much more efficient to let them kick anyway, that way the host dont have to sit there and continually ban them


[02-Mar-21 03:57 PM] lyss#0709
alright yeah, makes sense


[02-Mar-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk can I do the grammar test then kick low acc age people


[02-Mar-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
After the grammar test


[02-Mar-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Or does it have to be before grammar test


[02-Mar-21 04:27 PM] Polk#1596
u can just do it whenever u want


[02-Mar-21 04:27 PM] Polk#1596
i realized it doesnt really matter

[02-Mar-21 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
Also can we kick them for like: Low account age, threat to operations.


[02-Mar-21 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
Or: Threat to operations.


[02-Mar-21 04:28 PM] stacey#1000
Sounds better then threat to the game.


[02-Mar-21 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
Low account age is a no


[02-Mar-21 04:31 PM] Polk#1596
Possible threat to operations sure


[02-Mar-21 04:32 PM] Polk#1596
I like possible threat to operations more as well, gonna put it in


[02-Mar-21 04:43 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[02-Mar-21 05:13 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk can we do the same thing at trainings and get managers to check acc ages and kick if they have a low acc age or do we just check when we rank


[02-Mar-21 08:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
@Tattoblue you should google how they get those unqiue license plates on Roblox games its super cool concept to ensure no player has the same plate.


[02-Mar-21 08:23 PM] Beartikal#9760
i looked into it and its interesting stuff


[02-Mar-21 08:34 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes in my cs class my teacher talked about it a little bit although it was about databases and IDs and stuff like that she didn’t go into too much detail though :thinkception:  but yes interesting


[02-Mar-21 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
heres one way they coulda gone about it


[02-Mar-21 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/function/HttpService/GenerateGUID


[02-Mar-21 08:34 PM] Beartikal#9760
returns unique id every time


[02-Mar-21 08:35 PM] Beartikal#9760
they can shapeshift / warp the result to make it more license-plate looking


[02-Mar-21 08:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
or if you want to be a chad and copy real-life method you can add up numbers **sequentially** 1..2..3, A, B, ... Z, etc.


[02-Mar-21 08:37 PM] Beartikal#9760
in real life license plates are added sequentially so you can determine when the plate was issued by what the plate says

[03-Mar-21 02:13 AM] Polk#1596
yes you can do it at trainings if you want, but it wont be nearly as effective


[03-Mar-21 02:13 AM] Polk#1596
but you can do it as a precaution just in case they have an account age of 0 due to applications

[04-Mar-21 12:07 PM] ethan;#0003
been banned too many times


[04-Mar-21 12:07 PM] ethan;#0003
last appeal got denied


[04-Mar-21 12:08 PM] anna#0004
okayy thank u


[04-Mar-21 12:08 PM] ethan;#0003
she has been banned like 4-5 times


[04-Mar-21 12:08 PM] ethan;#0003
for the same reason


[04-Mar-21 12:08 PM] ethan;#0003
provoking people and participating in drama


[04-Mar-21 12:09 PM] anna#0004
yeah i thought he wouldnt be able to bc constantly getting banned just wanted to double check he keeps asking me if he can and i dont want to tell him anything incase hes been told differently


[04-Mar-21 12:09 PM] ethan;#0003
and she has evaded her ban by coming back on alts multiple times


[04-Mar-21 12:09 PM] ethan;#0003
last year she won an award on her alt


[04-Mar-21 12:10 PM] anna#0004
wait are u talking ab dais_ies or kenzi for that @ethan;


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
never appeal EITHER


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
kenzi is the same


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
provokes people


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
and causes drama


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
she was banned with kylie


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
during that whole situation


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] anna#0004
oh right okay


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] ethan;#0003
and ik kenzi has also been banned multiple times


[04-Mar-21 12:12 PM] ethan;#0003
if u want to put them on a card on the something that says dont appeal them


[04-Mar-21 12:17 PM] anna#0004
oh well theyre not blacklisted or anything so i dont know what card id add for them on the board but i think their bans on discord say to not appeal or at least dais_ies one does anyway


[04-Mar-21 12:33 PM] anna#0004
idk if u guys would agree but i think it would be easier if we had like a list on the hr board which has names of people who can never appeal or something so we'll always know


[04-Mar-21 12:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm we could do that yes if others agree


[04-Mar-21 01:13 PM] cory!#8287
I agree


[04-Mar-21 01:35 PM] katie#0200
yes pls


[04-Mar-21 02:14 PM] Polk#1596
cant we just use the permanently denied board for that


[04-Mar-21 02:15 PM] Polk#1596
since it serves somewhat the same purpose


[04-Mar-21 02:56 PM] cory!#8287
@Polk if someone asks how many days their account needs to be to get interviewed what would i say

[04-Mar-21 11:18 PM] stacey#1000
im just gonna say I just did the best promo ive probably ever done


[04-Mar-21 11:20 PM] stacey#1000
reagaming was reporting someone that was like cyberbullying and i was in a vc with her dealing with that and helping her out and they were trash talking her a lot and trying to get her fired. and instead I promoted her to rank 8 and made her day. screw the people that was putting her down and wanting her to get fired


[05-Mar-21 05:56 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yuh sure


[05-Mar-21 08:19 AM] Polk#1596
you can just say a few weeks old


[05-Mar-21 08:19 AM] Polk#1596
so youre not being too specific


[05-Mar-21 08:21 AM] katie#0200
@bonnie591 can I get an extension on r3mys promo because she just ended her inactivity notice like 2 hours ago so maybe we should give it a few more days

[05-Mar-21 01:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i think it was more of a sidenote


[05-Mar-21 01:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
the main word was the encouraging words of let this be a great session


[05-Mar-21 01:49 PM] katie#0200
LOL he did that at one of my sessions a few days ago


[05-Mar-21 01:49 PM] katie#0200
but weird that he’s doing it while im not there tho


[05-Mar-21 01:50 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I think he meant the MR Katie


[05-Mar-21 01:51 PM] katie#0200
oh LOL that would make more sense


[05-Mar-21 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
yes LOL


[05-Mar-21 02:11 PM] Polk#1596
wouldve been even more weird if he said that when u werent even there

@anna just blacklist he’s an LR not an MR that’s getting blacklisted. I was going to blacklist him last night because he was involved in harassing rea and I never got around to it because I ended up promoting rea.


[05-Mar-21 04:45 PM] anna#0004
oki i will do in a moment, ik we dont usually need opinions if its an LR but he was fired not blacklisted so i just wanted to check if blacklisting him was okayy


[05-Mar-21 04:45 PM] anna#0004
ty!


[05-Mar-21 04:54 PM] cory!#8287

turns out cutetineysylven had another account that was reccomended for mr a few months ago but she got locked out of it


[05-Mar-21 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
and then she made the account cutetinysylven


[05-Mar-21 09:49 PM] ethan;#0003
thats a big rip lol


[05-Mar-21 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
Semmasuperstar1 was her other account


[06-Mar-21 08:21 AM] cory!#8287
damn that account seems familiar


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] bonnie591#0591

fr


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
they are obviously trouble causing


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] cory!#8287
she baits people


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] cory!#8287
to get them in trouble


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] cory!#8287
and hes new


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] cory!#8287
so id just verbally warn him


[06-Mar-21 10:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
follows mrs around and uses boombox


[06-Mar-21 11:02 AM] stacey#1000

I can kick when I go on pc but that won’t be till later

But 2 accs in the discord is also a red flag


[06-Mar-21 11:08 AM] lyss#0709
while we're on the topic, an MR sent me this from their dms with a person who has a similar nickname to NewKwakseungeon. and while it does not prove that he promo suggested himself on an alt, it is a bit odd

o


[06-Mar-21 11:09 AM] stacey#1000
He hasn’t done anything major so I guess just keep an eye on him


[06-Mar-21 11:52 AM] KjRBLX#2053
All verrdin does is try to provoke people


[06-Mar-21 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
bruh


[06-Mar-21 02:04 PM] ethan;#0003

"Trouble causing. Ban approved by Founders"


[06-Mar-21 05:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
or maybe


[06-Mar-21 05:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
"Trouble causing with the boombox multiple times to cause inconvenience and disruption to the hotel. Ban approved by Founders."


[06-Mar-21 05:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
The founders approved it? Or u just gonna put that


[06-Mar-21 05:20 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Like a couple times


[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
no idea


[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
So couldn’t you do something regarding to that


[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah she has been


[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
Let me see how many times they been appealed


[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
i might just do


[06-Mar-21 05:23 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:24 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Mar-21 05:24 PM] stacey#1000
Just blacklist


[06-Mar-21 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
hmm


[06-Mar-21 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
She has had job before


[06-Mar-21 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
she wont be able to do anything though with a job and this is just an approval to ban from the founders


[06-Mar-21 05:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
not a blacklist


[06-Mar-21 05:25 PM] stacey#1000
How tf did she even get appealed before she was a cb


[06-Mar-21 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
Put reason as like: Threat to Operations/Trolling on multiple occasions.


[06-Mar-21 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[06-Mar-21 05:26 PM] stacey#1000
She was a cb and did troll a lot and clearly still follows MRs around on purpose to play loud music so...

[06-Mar-21 05:28 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Mar-21 05:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
but if we make the list where we do


[06-Mar-21 05:30 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:30 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
Also do you think after the awards we can look into the possibility of a new shift manager to see what everyone thinks. The sessions schedule has been kinda dead and we could use extra help on appeals and such so idk.


[06-Mar-21 05:32 PM] stacey#1000
We are doing good but can see what everyone thinks of the idea just a thought


[06-Mar-21 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
we'll see! who do we think we should hire


[06-Mar-21 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think acelesteq or drizzle


[06-Mar-21 05:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Both?


[06-Mar-21 05:33 PM] bonnie591#0591

i havent really noticed it


[06-Mar-21 05:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
plus if we hire two and it gets to summer when we are all more available it will become hell. idk if i want to hire any just yet


[06-Mar-21 05:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i think its just been ded right now, i looked on it earlier and expected a bunch to be on there


[06-Mar-21 05:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and seen that like 4 hours was free today


[06-Mar-21 05:36 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t think we need 2. I think we could use 1


[06-Mar-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
And it is dead cause I had to cancel my sessions for today and felt bad cause then it looked really dead


[06-Mar-21 05:37 PM] stacey#1000
And we could use more help in appeals and other stuff. Not just hosting

whenever i review an appeal i tend to accept it


[06-Mar-21 05:38 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes ace yes


[06-Mar-21 05:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
i never deny 😭


[06-Mar-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

[06-Mar-21 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
June


[06-Mar-21 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
June - September I think


[06-Mar-21 05:39 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Or June - beginning of October


[06-Mar-21 05:40 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Something like that


[06-Mar-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
June


[06-Mar-21 05:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
the thing is like i feel like waiting for a bit first before hiring


[06-Mar-21 05:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
i mean everyone is just gonna be busy at this time of year as finals and exams are just coming up


[06-Mar-21 05:40 PM] stacey#1000
We can wait till after awards


[06-Mar-21 05:41 PM] stacey#1000
But the session schedule is really dead and we could use one now


[06-Mar-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh yes awards thx for reminding me theres been a date change


[06-Mar-21 05:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Im on spring break sunday-saturday this week so maybe i can do extra
and I get for summer on may 25 (official day, but i prob be exempt and get out early)


[06-Mar-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
i feel like waiting until end of march first stacey


[06-Mar-21 05:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
then we'll see


[06-Mar-21 05:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but idk cuz i might get an actual job in the summer


[06-Mar-21 05:44 PM] stacey#1000
If I start another course in April right after the course I’m currently doing I’ll be even more busy


[06-Mar-21 06:54 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I dont see why not


[06-Mar-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 what about promoting people with safechat


[06-Mar-21 06:55 PM] stacey#1000
Are we going to allow that or no


[06-Mar-21 06:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm i dont think so but lets review that another day


[06-Mar-21 06:56 PM] Polk#1596
just because the training schedule is dry once doesnt mean we need a new shift manager


[06-Mar-21 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
Cause people will ask for sure


[06-Mar-21 06:56 PM] Polk#1596
but maybe soon


[06-Mar-21 06:56 PM] stacey#1000
That’s not the only reason why I said we could use a new one


[06-Mar-21 06:57 PM] stacey#1000
There is always a lot of appeals and stuff too. There is more to being an HR then just hosting. But yeah  we can review it later. Have to wait for awards to be done either way


[06-Mar-21 06:57 PM] Polk#1596
last shift promo was 2.5 months ago, i think we can wait a bit longer


[06-Mar-21 06:57 PM] Polk#1596
currently the HR team is good


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Imag has a question, do we allow pictures like this in fanart?

[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
basically stick figures


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
around summer time we can hire another one


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
which is in 3-4 months


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] stacey#1000
I think we should see what’s it’s like in April like Bonnie suggested


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
personally i think thats a bit dumb


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] stacey#1000
I won’t be able to host as much come April


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
its flooding the actual good art people have been putting huors of effort into


[06-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Polk#1596
if its a meme it can be posted in general


[06-Mar-21 06:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
well its because someone has been making stick figures


[06-Mar-21 06:59 PM] stacey#1000
If I get into this other course I will not have much time to host


[06-Mar-21 06:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
take a look in the fanart channel


[06-Mar-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
well we will be fine with 1 HR not being able to host


[06-Mar-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
but i see what u mean


[06-Mar-21 06:59 PM] Polk#1596
if theres a great need then ill change my opinion


[06-Mar-21 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
@Polk I applied for fite


[06-Mar-21 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
Im not saying we need to rn I’m just like saying later after awards if training schedule and other stuff continues to be dead we can see


[06-Mar-21 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
Just an idea is all


[06-Mar-21 07:00 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX uh yeah that shouldn’t be allowed


[06-Mar-21 07:00 PM] Polk#1596

for now I will disagree bc roblox is always changing stuff


[06-Mar-21 07:05 PM] Fraux#7971
so maybe give it a bit to see if they’re gonna keep it that way

@bonnie591 fraux got a point


[06-Mar-21 07:11 PM] Polk#1596
are you sure its staying this way?


[06-Mar-21 07:11 PM] Polk#1596
i dont want to let safechatters get receptionist


[06-Mar-21 07:11 PM] Polk#1596
just so one week later roblox makes it normal again and we have to struggle demoting them


[06-Mar-21 07:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
i have a feeling it will be staying this way


[06-Mar-21 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
+ even if they do change it we can work something out


[06-Mar-21 07:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
@Polk @Fraux


[06-Mar-21 07:17 PM] stacey#1000
Is this good


[06-Mar-21 07:17 PM] stacey#1000
**Fanart Channel Clarification**

Greetings, MRs. 

Recently there has been a lot of you posting fanart for people that looks like it has taken someone 5 seconds to make. This could be photos of stick people, or screenshots of profile pictures with just writing on it. I would like to remind you the fanart channel should **ONLY** contain fanart that people put time and effort into. 

When someone spends a lot of time and dedication into creating fanart for you, then sees the channel full of other photos of something that is obvious it took someone 5 seconds to make, it really doesn’t make them feel good. We want to be professional and support those that create amazing artwork and not flood the channel with unprofessional photos that is not even fanart at all. 

Going forward, **DO NOT** post fanart for people if it is not fanart at all. Remember to remain professional and use the channel for what it’s for, which is posting artwork for people that put time and effort into their work, not 5 seconds in creating a stick person. If you continue to post photos that is clearly not fanart, it will be deleted and you may face a warning. I will post a couple of examples of what you should **NOT** be posting in the channel. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this, or if you are unsure if something is okay to be posted in the channel, don’t be afraid to ask myself or another member of the HR team. 

Best regards,
staceyzn
General Manager
Bloxton Hotels.

[06-Mar-21 07:18 PM] Polk#1596
but having a feeling isnt good enough imo @bonnie591


[06-Mar-21 07:18 PM] Polk#1596
for a big change like that


[06-Mar-21 07:18 PM] Polk#1596
is it possible we can contact roblox


[06-Mar-21 07:18 PM] Polk#1596
like baby and bear contacting their roblox staff friends


[06-Mar-21 07:19 PM] Polk#1596
dont get me wrong i want to do it, but its a bit risky to do it not knowing if it will stay like this


[06-Mar-21 07:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
if it was to change back i dont really have a problem with them being receptionists anyway. they can still use the command to give rooms and most guests will just go to self checkin if they want a certain number


[06-Mar-21 07:20 PM] Polk#1596
good stuff


[06-Mar-21 07:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think its wroth doing it


[06-Mar-21 07:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes good stacey


[06-Mar-21 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
Ok posting now


[06-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Polk#1596
but that kinda ruins the point of roleplaying


[06-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Polk#1596
asking for a specific room


[06-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Polk#1596
i just highly suggest not to go through with it unless we are given the OK by roblox


[06-Mar-21 07:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
idk i think we should just do it tbh, i very much doubt they will change it back


[06-Mar-21 07:23 PM] Fraux#7971
i think it would be best to wait. no hurt in waiting.


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
but thats so risky bonnie


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
i can already imagine it


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
"hey can i have room ###?"


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] stacey#1000
Are managers and seniors allowed to delete stuff in fanart channel that’s not fanart at all


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
what about housekeeping. a guest can go and say i want my room ### cleaning


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
*receptionist gives another room*


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
*leaves*


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Polk#1596
yes but the guests show them their room dont they


[06-Mar-21 07:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
it would be weird if the guest had to walk to the room they wanted with a receptionist


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
agreed


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
its been like this since forever


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOL


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] Polk#1596
nobody will get upset since nobody knowss we're discussing it!


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
the thing is im pretty sure that they are allowing safechatters to see numbers now. its been like this for a good week and if they broke the chat filter it would of been changed by now


[06-Mar-21 07:25 PM] Fraux#7971
we can wait longer


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Fraux#7971
roblox likes to wait to change things


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
but a week isnt enough in my opinion


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
theyre slow like that


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok we'll wait, im gonna go email roblox too


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Fraux#7971
what he said


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
awesome, thanks bonnie


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
i just dont want kids getting upset


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
np!


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Fraux#7971
what he said again


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
good thing u brought that up fraux


[06-Mar-21 07:26 PM] Polk#1596
didnt even cross my mind LOL


[06-Mar-21 07:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok theres literally no category that will


[06-Mar-21 07:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
be like a question email


[06-Mar-21 07:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
so


[06-Mar-21 07:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
im not emailing them


[06-Mar-21 07:29 PM] Polk#1596
cant we get baby or bear to contact them


[06-Mar-21 07:29 PM] Polk#1596

Prolly not. Have fun tho


[07-Mar-21 01:53 AM] cory!#8287
I made KST timezone role for newkeuseungan or however u spell his user


[07-Mar-21 09:55 AM] anna#0004
i dont mind giving him a chance to appeal because the thing he sent that got him banned was an accident and he did apologise but i feel like the formers kind of exaggerated the whole situation purely because they dislike him, so i dont really mind giving him a chance to send an appeal in!


[07-Mar-21 10:06 AM] stacey#1000
I’m voting no strictly because he was blacklisted before, appealed and when he was in voice chats was inappropriate. He made people feel uncomfortable and would just do the same thing again.


[07-Mar-21 10:06 AM] stacey#1000
If you want to appeal that’s your choice that’s just my opinion on it.


[07-Mar-21 10:07 AM] stacey#1000
Flyro is just not a person I don’t think can be trusted.


[07-Mar-21 10:15 AM] stacey#1000
I also don’t think he should be comparing his case to other people that were blacklisted because every case is different.


[07-Mar-21 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
That’s just like trying to guilt trip into appealing at that point. And arguing about it? Yeah that doesn’t sound good to me either.


[07-Mar-21 10:16 AM] stacey#1000
Another reason why I vote no.


[07-Mar-21 10:35 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I did vote yes until I thought about the arguing part.


[07-Mar-21 10:37 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I think if he was truly ready then he wouldn’t do what stacey said, guilt trip


[07-Mar-21 10:46 AM] Tattoblue#5828
i voted no for those reasons above but also even when he was banned he'd try to get involved and would pester people (when uni was fired, probably some other instances too)


[07-Mar-21 10:47 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Didnt he try to get involved with connors termination


[07-Mar-21 10:47 AM] stacey#1000
That’s true he was also always getting involved with stuff he shouldn’t have.


[07-Mar-21 10:48 AM] stacey#1000
Trying to figure out why they were fired and trying to get them unfired, etc.


[07-Mar-21 10:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
can someone go and dm him why he cant appeal then since i cba to deal with his shit when ive got way too much other stuff to do


[07-Mar-21 11:02 AM] KjRBLX#2053
I could when i get back home but that would be around 1-2 pm


[07-Mar-21 01:28 PM] Beartikal#9760
i say no to flyro appeal


[07-Mar-21 01:29 PM] Beartikal#9760
given too many chances


[07-Mar-21 02:04 PM] bonnie591#0591

[07-Mar-21 02:09 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well I thought i was gonna get out of church and go straight home


[07-Mar-21 02:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But i gotta go to walmart and stuff


[07-Mar-21 02:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If it can wait i wanna do it


[07-Mar-21 02:10 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But if not then u can


[07-Mar-21 02:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053
If it can wait, it will be the first thing i do when i step thru the door


[07-Mar-21 02:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure there's no rush. Only do it if you want to tho!! @KjRBLX


[07-Mar-21 03:07 PM] katie#0200
btw i was told the former head sec cherryzv who was fired has made a new account called Cxciliqa, just letting yall know - i dont have solid proof but someone sent me some screenshots of some dms indicating that she is, dm me if you ever want to see it


[07-Mar-21 03:11 PM] KjRBLX#2053

when I blacklisted him again im pretty sure I said no more chances and to never appeal again


[07-Mar-21 04:13 PM] stacey#1000

does he not understand he was blacklisted for more then just posting a photo


[07-Mar-21 04:21 PM] stacey#1000
him complaining saying we appealed others and trying to guilt trip really makes our point of not appealing

Just stop dming him at this point. Just say: I've explained already why you are not permitted to appeal and I won't continue explaining it. So, this will be my last dm at this point, as continuing to argue about it won't change the outcome. Have a nice day.

Hi, everyone! :D My name is Polkinolk, but you can just call me Polk. I'm a guy from Norway with a passion for Roblox and editing videos for fun. My channel is mainly based on Roblox content!

I like to play a lot of different kinds of games on Roblox. Therefore, there's no specific theme I stick with, as I always like to try out new things!

@Polk do you know what max number of managers is


[09-Mar-21 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
I think it’s 60 and if so then uh


[09-Mar-21 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
We almost at 60


[09-Mar-21 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591


[09-Mar-21 02:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
65


[09-Mar-21 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
Oh good I thought it was 60 but we still close to max


[09-Mar-21 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
After we promote the new ones to manager


[09-Mar-21 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
We be at like 60 or more


[09-Mar-21 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
We should look at who’s inactive


[09-Mar-21 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
Is Saab inactive


[09-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
Once we get there we'll either look for inactives or just make it more difficult to get manager


[09-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think she's on notice


[09-Mar-21 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
Oh ok nvm


[09-Mar-21 02:35 PM] Polk#1596
yes


[09-Mar-21 02:35 PM] Polk#1596
now that gave me an idea


[09-Mar-21 02:50 PM] stacey#1000
Does anyone else want to promote D2reams. She is bst timezone and I just can’t seem to find her on any servers


[09-Mar-21 02:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
uh sure @stacey  i was think of making a game..would you like to help?


[09-Mar-21 02:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Like we make terrain with a bunch of holes


[09-Mar-21 02:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and people join the game to search


[09-Mar-21 02:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
and find a secret message


[09-Mar-21 02:51 PM] stacey#1000
What if she doesn’t join the game


[09-Mar-21 02:51 PM] KjRBLX#2053
i could get someone to encourage her


[09-Mar-21 02:52 PM] stacey#1000
I’m not on till later est usually and since she’s bst she is not on when I am


[09-Mar-21 02:52 PM] KjRBLX#2053
its like 8:52 PM for her, right?


[09-Mar-21 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
Rn it is and I can’t get on pc till later


[09-Mar-21 02:53 PM] stacey#1000
When I’m on usually she’s probably sleeping


[09-Mar-21 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
So yeah if anyone else wants to promote her go ahead


[09-Mar-21 02:54 PM] stacey#1000
@anna @emily you are both bst do you see her?


[09-Mar-21 02:58 PM] anna#0004

[09-Mar-21 05:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
i think i wanna give the award winners something special what do u guys think we should do


[09-Mar-21 05:03 PM] Beartikal#9760
be it in-game items, etc.


[09-Mar-21 05:05 PM] Polk#1596
oo yeah


[09-Mar-21 05:05 PM] Polk#1596
would be kind of cool with a trophy that spawns in their inventory


[09-Mar-21 05:05 PM] stacey#1000
Maybe like a special item at the hotel


[09-Mar-21 05:05 PM] Polk#1596
or maybe a trophy next to the username?


[09-Mar-21 05:05 PM] Polk#1596
or both!


[09-Mar-21 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
What if they got like 100 hotel bucks, then a trophy or something


[09-Mar-21 05:06 PM] stacey#1000
I like Polks idea


[09-Mar-21 05:07 PM] Polk#1596
yeah some in-game currency would also be pretty cool


[09-Mar-21 05:07 PM] Polk#1596
like a winner package


[09-Mar-21 05:07 PM] stacey#1000
A trophy next to name at the hotel and training and interview centre would be cool


[10-Mar-21 02:27 AM] Beartikal#9760
cool. ill get something planned

not let them win since its not fair


[10-Mar-21 11:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
what bugs me is


[10-Mar-21 11:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
theres only 5 votes between 2nd and 3rd place


[10-Mar-21 11:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
them 358 votes could of made a gap between them


[10-Mar-21 11:02 AM] ethan;#0003
release another doc with just the art?


[10-Mar-21 11:02 AM] ethan;#0003

ones probably getting fired and we dont have enough hosts anymore


[11-Mar-21 05:50 PM] stacey#1000
tyy


[11-Mar-21 06:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
Whos getting fired wat


[11-Mar-21 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
megan on 2nd activity strike and i know she getting fired for sure


[11-Mar-21 06:09 PM] stacey#1000
i told bloo about it


[11-Mar-21 06:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
I see


[11-Mar-21 06:11 PM] bonnie591#0591
Was she dmed about her inactivity strike @Bloo_Berriez @stacey


[11-Mar-21 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
oh ya


[11-Mar-21 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
she going to do nothing this week then get fired for inactivity finally


[11-Mar-21 06:12 PM] stacey#1000
bloo already been on it cause I told him she had no notice and was doing nothing


[11-Mar-21 06:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
I believe a demotion to management may be a better way to go since firing over 3 weeks of inactivity from a senior position isn't great, considering managers and heads can do that and get away from it


[11-Mar-21 06:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
With it*


[11-Mar-21 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
But she has been inactive forever and getting demoted to manager will just mean she will just quit anyway. She won’t do anything as manager either.


[11-Mar-21 06:15 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I don’t see the point in demoting  to manager


[11-Mar-21 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
Remember she was sent an inactive thing back in November too.


[11-Mar-21 06:15 PM] stacey#1000
She needs to just be demoted to LR.


[11-Mar-21 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
Like fr. I’ve spoken to her multiple times and told her if she’s bored of senior to resign. And she says “I do feel bad I’m holding I’m an active senior spot and I’m just bored. But I will be active” then of course she’s never active so I stopped trying to talk sense into her


[11-Mar-21 06:16 PM] stacey#1000
She needs to honestly just be demoted because she can’t seem to resign.


[11-Mar-21 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
She’s had activity problems for like a year now.


[11-Mar-21 06:17 PM] stacey#1000
She also ignored bloos inactivity DMs.


[11-Mar-21 06:18 PM] stacey#1000
That’s all I got to say


[11-Mar-21 06:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ultimately it's up to baby since we will need to run the demotion request by him once a third inactivity strike is given. I can see why we should demote to LR, but we are a pretty lenient group when it comes to activity so a demotion to management is more lenient for 3 weeks of inactivity in a row as a senior. We'll see though


[11-Mar-21 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
If she got demoted to management, she would either resign then and there or would continue to be inactive and take up an active manager spot.


[11-Mar-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
She’s been inactive way before the 3 weeks. But alright we can wait and see


[11-Mar-21 06:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Thing with Megan is that she doesn’t try at all. And actually it will be 4 weeks after this week. She would technically would have had 3 strike already but I didn’t realize until Stacey contacted me about her being without a notice and getting 0’s on her checklists, hence why I moved the notices back to the senior board because I never looked at Discord. But yeah, she didn’t even acknowledge my strike notice to her and I’m not gonna be chasing her to get her notices up or to get active. She’s a senior, and has been for idk how long now. She should know better.


[11-Mar-21 06:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
Alright we'll recommend a demotion to lr


[11-Mar-21 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
she was told that she needs to complete up to 75% of her checklist every week if she didnt have a notice


[11-Mar-21 07:00 PM] ethan;#0003
and she doesnt have a notice


[11-Mar-21 07:02 PM] stacey#1000
She’s been a senior over a year and hasn’t put in effort into her position for over a year.


[11-Mar-21 07:03 PM] stacey#1000
She told me herself she’s bored of Bloxton being a senior because it’s repetitive and I told her to resign and come back as an LR to not have to worry about requirements but she’s too selfish to resign and is basically in it for the rank at this point it seems.


[11-Mar-21 07:16 PM] ethan;#0003
@KjRBLX ban them and fire them thats just unacceptable even if its in another discord


[11-Mar-21 07:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[11-Mar-21 07:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[12-Mar-21 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
its a long break but understandable since her father isnt too well


[12-Mar-21 12:24 PM] ethan;#0003
I think the last session she went to was June 20th 2020


[12-Mar-21 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
I think after her suspension and when slee left she just went fully inactive


[12-Mar-21 12:28 PM] ethan;#0003
cus she was suspended around that time also


[12-Mar-21 12:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok true but i dont want to go chasing her about her inactivity when she says she has her dad in a hospice as thats kinda wrong. if she continues inactivity after that though and throughout the summer, then we can demote


[12-Mar-21 02:05 PM] Polk#1596

@here can anyone actually see the screen moving, because I feel like people only celebrate when I explicitly say the award, after checking the livestream polk has on it seems like nobody can see anything LOLLL


[12-Mar-21 03:45 PM] babymariobebe#7563
Just my chat, but not the award thing that plays

well its just link to hotel unless u want private server link


[12-Mar-21 04:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
it would also be cool to use btools for future events too


[12-Mar-21 04:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
only in private servers tho ofc


[12-Mar-21 04:52 PM] bonnie591#0591
public server would be abuse

If they are cyberbullying through discord none of them can be in the discord server.


[12-Mar-21 10:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
There was a person in the discord server named Jack, Fxallon sent a DM from them, they only wanted to join the server and said they didn't like Mansion. I didn't get any proof of them cybulling though.

Every single person in that group chat gets a blacklist and ban from the discord server if they are not banned already


[12-Mar-21 10:02 PM] stacey#1000
I knew Hadley couldn’t be trusted


[12-Mar-21 10:03 PM] stacey#1000
I’m banning Hadley from the discord right now


[12-Mar-21 10:03 PM] stacey#1000
She will never get appealed again


[12-Mar-21 10:03 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What's crazy is...they call it standing up to a child groomer/pedo or whatever


[12-Mar-21 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
And anyone else in that group chat that you know is not banned or blacklisted already you can ban them


[12-Mar-21 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
And blacklist. 0 tolerance for cyberbullying


[12-Mar-21 10:04 PM] stacey#1000
This is disgusting behaviour from these people


[12-Mar-21 10:06 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX do you think that’s fair


[12-Mar-21 10:07 PM] stacey#1000
Do ban them from the discord and blacklist?

Can you guys also vote on what I announced pls


[12-Mar-21 10:12 PM] bonnie591#0591
OMG IMAG KEPT DOING STUFF LIKE THAT


[12-Mar-21 10:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@stacey Well no but I did issue bans yesterday to the ones in the GC, but lifted them, and if you scroll around to the end of the video you can see them talking about their own bans


[12-Mar-21 10:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Even hadley saying the server disappeared.


[12-Mar-21 10:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Maybe just get him to get a separate video of him clicking on this names in the guidelist and scrolling through their profiles, because if I tell him to go back through and re-record again..i feel like he'll come back with a 2 hour video


[12-Mar-21 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
Ya cause we can’t ban people from the discord without confirmation it’s them or not and need discord name and tag


[12-Mar-21 10:18 PM] stacey#1000
You unbanned them all?


[12-Mar-21 10:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Yeah, small judgement error, went back and reversed.


[12-Mar-21 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
Every single person in that group chat involved with cyberbullying gets banned from the discord


[12-Mar-21 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
If you can get all the names and tags and proof it’s them


[12-Mar-21 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll ban them all


[12-Mar-21 10:20 PM] stacey#1000
They get fired and blacklisted too


[12-Mar-21 10:21 PM] stacey#1000
No tolerance policy on bullying


[12-Mar-21 10:22 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn’t need to take place inside the discord server to get banned from the discord for bullying. If they are using discord to target and bully people they can target more people inside the discord


[12-Mar-21 10:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
GOODNIGHT


[12-Mar-21 10:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So, just get mansion to click on their name in the list? No need to scroll through the whole chat again?


[12-Mar-21 10:23 PM] stacey#1000
No just to click the names of everyone on the list and confirm their discord name and tag and if they are in the Bloxton discord


[12-Mar-21 10:23 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah no need to scroll through chat


[12-Mar-21 10:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright.


[12-Mar-21 10:24 PM] stacey#1000
I’ll ban them all and if they try to argue I’ll tell them myself there is no tolerance at all for bullying


[12-Mar-21 10:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053
oh how would he confirm if they're in the discord?


[12-Mar-21 10:32 PM] stacey#1000
Nvm jsut get discord name and tag


[12-Mar-21 10:32 PM] stacey#1000
Then I’ll check to see who’s in the discord and who’s not


[12-Mar-21 10:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Alright.


[12-Mar-21 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
Oh and also get their roblox usernames if he has them


[12-Mar-21 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
So we can blacklist those that were bullying


[12-Mar-21 10:34 PM] stacey#1000
I sleep now I’ll look at this again tomorrow gn

Hadley send that to persuade her arguments about she didn’t do as much as other people.


[13-Mar-21 05:10 AM] stacey#1000
She won’t get appealed again. She had her 2nd chance and trying to argue she didn’t do as much doesn’t cut it. She was in the group chat apart of it and thought it was okay, 0 tolerance she won’t be let back in the discord again. That was her 2nd chance and she did something even worse then the first time I banned her. She’s always involved in drama. Trying to say she “didn’t do as much as other people” is really disappointing. Instead of taking responsibility for her actions she blames other people. She didn’t report this and supported them and took part in it.


[13-Mar-21 05:11 AM] stacey#1000
Good work though, I see they all banned and blacklisted now.

@ethan; @stacey there was one more girl, she left the group chat, but she chatted. mansion could just scroll to one of her chats, click her name, open her profile for proof that she was there right?


[13-Mar-21 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
Mhm @KjRBLX


[13-Mar-21 10:18 AM] stacey#1000
If they were involved with the bullying and such they can get banned too with enough proof


[13-Mar-21 11:41 AM] KjRBLX#2053
8:17 in video -2, if you wanna see the first photo video. Enough? @stacey

@KjRBLX was coco like actively participating in the cyberbullying, like saying disrespectful/inappropriate things about mansion etc? cause she’s dming me saying she was forced into it cause if she didn’t participate she would have gotten exposed by fallon

I don’t think it’s photoshopped


[13-Mar-21 06:32 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! It was still ultimately her choice. She could’ve easily reported it. She seems to be making excuses at this point because at the end of the day it is her choice. She should’ve reported the situation if she was being threatened and take responsibility for her actions.


[13-Mar-21 06:33 PM] stacey#1000
You make your own choices. No one can force you to do anything. If they threaten or scare you, you report it and don’t do something you know is wrong.


[13-Mar-21 06:34 PM] stacey#1000
She should’ve blocked and reported the user.


[13-Mar-21 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
If she didn’t say anything bad to them maybe she can get unblackisted depending on it but still


[13-Mar-21 06:44 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[13-Mar-21 07:22 PM] cory!#8287
nvm she was participating i just watched the video


[13-Mar-21 07:28 PM] katie#0200
@cory! btw im pretty sure this is photoshopped - firstly the dates on that are a lot larger than they actually are on mobile, and notice how there’s like a darker blur thing around the names and text, also the gap between the dates and the names are a bit off/inconsistent in each message

[14-Mar-21 08:23 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 what do you think of seniors being able to get a new channel in the discord called gamenights so then whenever they want to host a public one they can post there so they know who’s hosting or is that too many channels


[14-Mar-21 08:23 AM] stacey#1000
Like senior gamenight planning or something


[14-Mar-21 08:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
So basically a schedule? @stacey


[14-Mar-21 08:28 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah like a new channel just for them so then it’s easy to plan who’s hosting gamenights when so there is not too many


[14-Mar-21 08:28 AM] stacey#1000
Since they will only be allowed to do 2 a day max


[14-Mar-21 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
It can be named senior-gamenights or something


[14-Mar-21 08:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
Sure. We could do senior gamenights channel for planning and also maybe a schedule on senior board so they know who's hosting when @stacey


[14-Mar-21 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
Awesome


[14-Mar-21 09:02 AM] stacey#1000
Can we also get senior vote soon maybe for 1-2 new seniors? @bonnie591


[14-Mar-21 09:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah, we'll demote Megan first and give it a few days, then I'll set one up.


[14-Mar-21 09:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
I got permission from Baby and he says yeah demote to LR


[14-Mar-21 09:04 AM] bonnie591#0591
So bloo can do it tomorrow


[14-Mar-21 09:13 AM] stacey#1000
Ok awesome


[14-Mar-21 09:16 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 is there any update on trey either or no


[14-Mar-21 09:17 AM] stacey#1000
Last question I’ll ask then I’ll stop annoying you


[14-Mar-21 09:18 AM] bonnie591#0591
Nope, baby and bear are driving somewhere I believe so they haven't had time to discuss it. I'll dm them about it again


[14-Mar-21 09:18 AM] stacey#1000
Ok ty


[14-Mar-21 09:19 AM] stacey#1000
Ironic thing about Megan is that she put in an LOA of SCSO yesterday and can’t take 2 mins to do it for Bloxton or talk to Bloo about it


[14-Mar-21 09:20 AM] bonnie591#0591
Idc if she puts an LOA in or not tbh we're firing her either way


[14-Mar-21 09:21 AM] bonnie591#0591
I have a question for you.. or well just need your opinion on something @stacey


[14-Mar-21 09:22 AM] stacey#1000
Ok


[14-Mar-21 09:22 AM] stacey#1000
And about time Megan gets fired tbh


[14-Mar-21 09:23 AM] bonnie591#0591
el1ierose made their account in September and their first badge was Bloxton. This does like raise alerts that she might be a CB. But it could also be is she made a new account to avoid safechat? I kinda leaning towards the safechat theory as her first messages in the discord server seems to be childish and nooby. Do you think we should give her the opportunity of a promotion to Head? @stacey

3rd strike this week?


[14-Mar-21 09:24 AM] stacey#1000
If she has good activity and reports, I doubt she would be a cb. We have MRs right now like Maya the senior for example that made their account to get rid of safechat or get a new username and joined Bloxton the day they joined on that account


[14-Mar-21 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
And yeah he should get fired too. He is doing the bare minimum. 1 thing a week not even getting 50%


[14-Mar-21 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
Reminds me of Darren. Doing 1 thing just to keep rank.


[14-Mar-21 09:25 AM] stacey#1000
I would give her a chance if she is dedicated and stuff @bonnie591


[14-Mar-21 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
We also need to start looking at inactive managers


[14-Mar-21 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
We are almost at the max.


[14-Mar-21 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
Can we please just demote Saab.  She’s barely been active ever since she got manager. What’s the point in waiting till the summer.


[14-Mar-21 09:27 AM] stacey#1000
She is holding up an active manager spot


[14-Mar-21 09:28 AM] bonnie591#0591
Hm yeah, I'll agree. I'm gonna dm her and see if there's any hope or anything first.


[14-Mar-21 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
Okay. I’ll look and see if there is any other managers that are inactive


[14-Mar-21 09:29 AM] stacey#1000
@High Rank anyone want to help me look into the managers to see who’s inactive and barely does anything. Because we are almost at max.


[14-Mar-21 09:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
I had a look the other day and everyone I looked at met the requirements


[14-Mar-21 09:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
Or well at least did a shift and two sessions


[14-Mar-21 09:30 AM] stacey#1000
There might be some managers that do 1 thing every other week or something


[14-Mar-21 09:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
If we get to the max dw too much as people resign and we'll be promoting people to senior


[14-Mar-21 09:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
We'll just have to make it so you have to be head for longer or something.


[14-Mar-21 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
The one manager that is obv really inactive is Saab


[14-Mar-21 09:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah I'll dm her


[14-Mar-21 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
Alright ty


[14-Mar-21 09:31 AM] stacey#1000
I’ll look at managers later just to be sure


[14-Mar-21 09:31 AM] bonnie591#0591
Okay


[14-Mar-21 09:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
Dmed saab


[14-Mar-21 09:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
Basically I'm giving her three options


[14-Mar-21 09:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
Resign, become active or demotion


[14-Mar-21 09:48 AM] stacey#1000
I mean I’d hate to demote her because of personal stuff she’s going through but at the same time everyone has personal stuff in their life and if she’s going to be inactive for months and not do anything, then she should resign.


[14-Mar-21 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
We should have a rule tbh stating how long u can consecutively go on notice for


[14-Mar-21 09:49 AM] bonnie591#0591
3 months normal. 5 months with hr review / bod approval


[14-Mar-21 09:50 AM] stacey#1000
Good idea. Because the rule we made about making a new notice every month is not working either. If you have to be inactive for so many months to make it like half a year or whatever you shouldn’t be in the position because you are holding up an active spot for someone else


[14-Mar-21 09:51 AM] stacey#1000
Like people that will try going inactive an entire school year annoys me. Using school as an excuse to go inactive for 8-10 months.


[14-Mar-21 09:51 AM] bonnie591#0591
Agreed


[14-Mar-21 09:51 AM] stacey#1000
I think 3 months is fair.


[14-Mar-21 09:51 AM] stacey#1000
That’s a long time.


[14-Mar-21 09:54 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah and if they really need up to 5 months for a good reason we can approve. Anything more than that is unacceptable. Also a limit to how many they can post or like a necessary gap between notices like u can only go inactive for 5 months maximum per year


[14-Mar-21 09:56 AM] stacey#1000
Not a bad idea. Would we be able to monitor their activity easily on the discord still though? We have so many managers and heads now it’s kinda hard to see their notices sometimes.


[14-Mar-21 09:57 AM] bonnie591#0591
We could post their notice onto a new board or. Something


[14-Mar-21 09:57 AM] stacey#1000
Like I find it hard to see when someone ends a notice


[14-Mar-21 09:57 AM] stacey#1000
It’s confusing to me when it’s on the discord. That’s why the seniors was moved back to the senior board


[14-Mar-21 09:57 AM] stacey#1000
On a trello would be easier


[14-Mar-21 09:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
Also u know how managers have activity requirements of like two Sessions a week


[14-Mar-21 10:00 AM] bonnie591#0591
We could do head requirements too


[14-Mar-21 10:00 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah good idea


[14-Mar-21 10:00 AM] stacey#1000
Cause I was about to say how is mirk still a head rn


[14-Mar-21 10:00 AM] stacey#1000
He’s been a head forever and barely does anything


[14-Mar-21 10:01 AM] stacey#1000
All he does is talk in the discord


[14-Mar-21 10:06 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah


[14-Mar-21 10:08 AM] bonnie591#0591
We could have the same requirements as managements for head so like 2 sessions and one shift at hotel


[14-Mar-21 10:12 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah good idea. We should just have a separate board for heads only where they can log shifts and put inactive notices. Something small that we wouldn’t care if it got leaked


[14-Mar-21 10:13 AM] stacey#1000
Literally only like 2-3 lists needed


[14-Mar-21 10:13 AM] stacey#1000
We been needing it for awhile


[14-Mar-21 10:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yee I agree


[14-Mar-21 10:20 AM] Polk#1596
did i just hear new trello


[14-Mar-21 10:21 AM] Polk#1596
tell me more about it and i can get to work


[14-Mar-21 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
@Polk just an easy trello for heads only. They can post inactive notices there, and can have cards to log shifts and sessions with requirements to do like 2 sessions and 1 shift a week. You could also maybe put interview procedures there too I guess


[14-Mar-21 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
Just something simple that if it got leaked it’s small and we wouldn’t be losing a lot of it did


[14-Mar-21 10:27 AM] stacey#1000
And easier to track their activity and inactivity


[14-Mar-21 10:27 AM] stacey#1000
And can we also put managers inactive notices back on the manager board


[14-Mar-21 10:28 AM] bonnie591#0591
U can seek.approval from baby or bear and start polk, don't add yet heads yet tho


[14-Mar-21 10:29 AM] stacey#1000
Yeah just get it started so then if it get approved it’s ready


[14-Mar-21 10:29 AM] stacey#1000
Then maybe after that if it’s approved we can make an announcement about requirements for going inactive or something


[14-Mar-21 10:30 AM] stacey#1000
Ok I nap now got no sleep cause of stupid time change gn

[14-Mar-21 02:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
Anyone who misused the group wall today has been given a warning, you won't get a DM about this, it was just logged. This offence is usually a suspension, if anyone does this again for a themed session they will be suspended for 3 days.


[14-Mar-21 02:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey


[14-Mar-21 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
ok but ill mention for a themed session or any other occurence


[14-Mar-21 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
this should scare them enough not to do it again


[14-Mar-21 02:42 PM] stacey#1000
**Professionalism on the Group Wall**


Greetings MRs,

I am disappointed I am having to make an announcement regarding this because I thought you all knew better, but apparently not. You should **NEVER** be unprofessional on the group wall. Staff members get fired/suspended for misusing the group wall and when you go and do the exact same thing, you are encouraging that behaviour.

You are all role models for our staff members and when you decide to act highly unprofessional on the group wall, what kind of image are you painting for people? You are telling them it’s okay to do something that we don’t tolerate **AT ALL**. I expected better. Let this be your **ONLY** reminder to **NEVER** be unprofessional on the group wall. Use the group wall professionally and for its purpose from now on.  

Anyone who misused the group wall today has been given a warning, you won't get a DM about this, it was just logged. This offence is usually a suspension, if anyone does this again for a themed session or any other occurrence, they will be suspended for 3 days. No exceptions. 


Do not make me have to suspend you for this and be good role models. Be professional and don’t encourage unprofessional behaviour. I hope I have made myself clear.


Sincerely,
staceyzn
General Manager

[14-Mar-21 03:07 PM] stacey#1000

I think we should give her another chance


[14-Mar-21 03:07 PM] stacey#1000
otherwise she would be a senior right now


[14-Mar-21 03:08 PM] bonnie591#0591

if all we agree


[14-Mar-21 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
the only senior that host all the time for me is ace thats why she gets my vote for shift


[14-Mar-21 03:14 PM] lyss#0709
jess alwaysss asks to host


[14-Mar-21 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
yes she goes above any beyond the requirements


[14-Mar-21 03:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
she also has sizzle hr experience!


[14-Mar-21 03:14 PM] lyss#0709
besides her its usually drizzle


[14-Mar-21 03:14 PM] stacey#1000
yes drizzle hosts for me a lot too


[14-Mar-21 03:15 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Its been a while since I’ve hosted more than 1 server at the same time..but i still have to ping in lounge if someone wants to host


[14-Mar-21 03:15 PM] stacey#1000
I want ace first though


[14-Mar-21 03:15 PM] lyss#0709

[14-Mar-21 03:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
then he died


[14-Mar-21 03:25 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Mar-21 03:25 PM] cory!#8287

Typed in @q in staff lounge and not a tag insight


[14-Mar-21 03:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sometimes it's hard to find his tag idk why


[14-Mar-21 03:30 PM] lyss#0709
i didnt host for 5 months as a senior and when i came back i practically forgot how to host so like i dont blame him!


[14-Mar-21 03:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@quwan maybe it will come up


[14-Mar-21 03:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[14-Mar-21 03:32 PM] Polk#1596

[14-Mar-21 03:35 PM] bonnie591#0591
He be gone


[14-Mar-21 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
yes goodbye to quwanterz and megan


[14-Mar-21 03:35 PM] stacey#1000
neither of them have cared about their position for months


[14-Mar-21 03:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
He still not showing up for me..does anyone have his discord id?


[14-Mar-21 03:36 PM] stacey#1000
for quwanterz?


[14-Mar-21 03:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, if i do remember, he was in staff vc not too long ago


[14-Mar-21 03:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I think playing a game with jackii


[14-Mar-21 03:36 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Mhm


[14-Mar-21 03:36 PM] Tattoblue#5828

271596100622745600


[14-Mar-21 03:37 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[14-Mar-21 03:37 PM] Tattoblue#5828
he posted his inactivity notice in discord when seniors moved back to the trello board


[14-Mar-21 03:37 PM] Tattoblue#5828
:facepalm:

[14-Mar-21 03:37 PM] stacey#1000
is he not even verified on the discord?


[14-Mar-21 03:37 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
LOL that’s literally what I was telling bonnie earlier


[14-Mar-21 03:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
He will be


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
It just won't show always


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] cory!#8287
he has roles for me


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
he hasn’t even made an effort to look at senior announcement


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
neither has megan


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
while we talking about inactive seniors


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
what about emm_yyx


[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[14-Mar-21 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
common excuse im inactive for 5-10 months for school!!!


[14-Mar-21 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
I really hate it when people use that as an excuse


[14-Mar-21 03:39 PM] cory!#8287
pretty sure i saw him playing a game yesterday lol


[14-Mar-21 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
everyone has school and has free time outside of it


[14-Mar-21 03:39 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I believe i see him on DND on discord sometimes


[14-Mar-21 03:39 PM] stacey#1000
school is not 24/7


[14-Mar-21 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
its understandable if you taking a little bit of  time for exams and stuff for finals like I took a week off for


[14-Mar-21 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
but when its legit 5+ months with the excuse of school that doesnt cut it


[14-Mar-21 03:40 PM] KjRBLX#2053
5 months..that’s like a whole school semester


[14-Mar-21 03:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
A whole school semester and winter break maybe


[14-Mar-21 03:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Idk tho cant keep count


[14-Mar-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
nvm emm_yyx is fine for now shes been inactive since Jan 25


[14-Mar-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
but if she still inactive end of april for 3 months


[14-Mar-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
then its an issue


[14-Mar-21 03:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
Just FYI Megan was rank 5 and quw was rank 6 @Bloo_Berriez


[14-Mar-21 03:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
U know what u should do bloo :Smiling:


[14-Mar-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
are we going to announce to seniors they were demoted or no


[14-Mar-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
cause I feel like the seniors can at least be trusted to know


[14-Mar-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
and should know tbh


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Stay up tonight and do it before u sleep so they can be gone soon @Bloo_Berriez :)) only if u want to tho


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
They will have demoted or something on their checklist card


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
and also like a good message to other seniors to not go inactive like that


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
I don't think an announcement would be necessary


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Wait


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
but other seniors might start asking about them and i feel like we should at least inform them


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe he could include it in his one hundred percent thing


[14-Mar-21 03:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
Because


[14-Mar-21 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Then we can motivate seniors who do same thing but aren't that inactive yet


[14-Mar-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
like we can just say something short so they know we are serious about requirements and will demote if they try to get away with stuff


[14-Mar-21 03:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ye good idea include it in ur thing @Bloo_Berriez


[14-Mar-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
I trust the seniors not to leak it so


[14-Mar-21 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
I mean


[14-Mar-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
i mean no seniors have leaked ever since Ive been an HR so


[14-Mar-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
except for former seniors


[14-Mar-21 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's probs obvious anyway since they will be ranked to LR and they are inactive so


[14-Mar-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
ya


[14-Mar-21 03:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
Even if it got leaked yea that's a problem but duh obviously


[14-Mar-21 03:46 PM] stacey#1000
im glad we can finally fire them


[14-Mar-21 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
ive legit told megan back in feb and in jan to resign because she told me she was bored and its repetitive and that resigning and coming back as an LR would be better with no requirements and she says "I will be active" and then never was, hence why I told bloo to get her out the door


[14-Mar-21 03:48 PM] bonnie591#0591

why dont u want the head trello @ethan;


[14-Mar-21 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
Will every head get added to it?


[14-Mar-21 04:48 PM] ethan;#0003
It’s just one more thing to get leaked


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] Polk#1596
but the thing is


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] Polk#1596
it wont affect anything if it gets leaked


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] Polk#1596
obviously we dont want them to talk freely about it


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] ethan;#0003
If it’s for PURELY just logging


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] Polk#1596
but it will just be for them to log their stuff and inactivity notices


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] Polk#1596
purely for logging yes


[14-Mar-21 04:49 PM] ethan;#0003
Then why can’t it be a google forum linked to a Trello


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Where they log on the forum and sends it to the Trello


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
actually


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
you got a point there


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
the only person i know that knows how to do that is cossie from stapleton


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Just like Firestone departments do it


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
and i dont really want him to have access to that


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
ye


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] ethan;#0003
Cassie showed me something how to background check people on Trello but I forgot


[14-Mar-21 04:50 PM] Polk#1596
i can contact him i guess


[14-Mar-21 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003
It’s how they do background checks for DPW


[14-Mar-21 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk how but I want to ask him


[14-Mar-21 04:51 PM] ethan;#0003
So we can do that for people we promote


[14-Mar-21 04:54 PM] Polk#1596
I GOT A DEAL WITH COSSIE @ethan;

bro if we can figure this out


[14-Mar-21 04:55 PM] Polk#1596
we can implement it for a ton of things


[14-Mar-21 04:55 PM] Polk#1596
the only problem is if people get the link and start raiding it


[14-Mar-21 04:55 PM] Polk#1596
it'll be bad


[14-Mar-21 04:55 PM] Polk#1596
but at least we would be able to keep the trello


[14-Mar-21 04:56 PM] ethan;#0003
It’ll need a separate account


[14-Mar-21 04:57 PM] ethan;#0003
Like Firestone has a bot account


[14-Mar-21 04:57 PM] ethan;#0003

hadleys friend and all those banned peoples friend


[14-Mar-21 08:22 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t want to accept it


[14-Mar-21 08:22 PM] ethan;#0003
claims he was apart of their stuff


[14-Mar-21 08:23 PM] ethan;#0003
and wants to be banned or soemthing with them


[14-Mar-21 08:23 PM] ethan;#0003
to get attention to his lonely life


[14-Mar-21 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
Ya I won’t accept it he will probably add me to gc with them


[14-Mar-21 08:23 PM] stacey#1000
If he keeps sending me friend request. I’ll block him


[14-Mar-21 09:38 PM] KjRBLX#2053

It hasn’t even been a month


[14-Mar-21 10:27 PM] ethan;#0003
Don’t people need to be banned for a month to even get considered for an appeal


[14-Mar-21 10:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Imma just tell him to come back and see in a month


[14-Mar-21 10:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Also, Chicago asked me if trey dmed me..


[14-Mar-21 10:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Hopefully he isn’t gonna dm me about his opinion on hadley and the others


[14-Mar-21 11:05 PM] ethan;#0003
Hadley has been banned multiple times


[14-Mar-21 11:05 PM] ethan;#0003

[15-Mar-21 01:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
megan put up an inactivity notice like 2 hours ago


[15-Mar-21 01:47 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

@bonnie591 am I allowed to tell Maya Megan was demoted due to inactivity she’s asking or is it not being announced to seniors anymore


[15-Mar-21 08:28 AM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez I think when you announce checklist later you should mention they were demoted


[15-Mar-21 08:28 AM] stacey#1000
I won’t respond to maya rn


[15-Mar-21 08:29 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey has she noticed yet


[15-Mar-21 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
No Megan hasn’t messaged me


[15-Mar-21 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
She would’ve been given a dm from Bloo anyways


[15-Mar-21 08:29 AM] stacey#1000
So she will sooner or later


[15-Mar-21 08:29 AM] stacey#1000

She’s kinda acting like it’s my fault. “You know I haven’t had time to do anything.” Doesn’t mean you can’t take 5 mins to respond to bloos DMs and discuss your situation not my fault


[15-Mar-21 09:17 AM] lyss#0709
is she really that surprised 💀


[15-Mar-21 09:18 AM] stacey#1000

It’s.  Not. My. Fault.

i hate to see megan go but she had a lot of opportunities to at least try to improve


[15-Mar-21 09:18 AM] stacey#1000
I think it was best she got demoted anyways


[15-Mar-21 09:18 AM] stacey#1000
She had activity problems way before


[15-Mar-21 09:23 AM] stacey#1000
I just told her Bloo contacted her regarding it and it’s not something I could control


[15-Mar-21 09:51 AM] ethan;#0003

i contacted her a few months back


[15-Mar-21 09:51 AM] ethan;#0003
She did her checklist for one week and never did it again


[15-Mar-21 10:06 AM] Fraux#7971
hi y’all! i hope you all have a wonderful day


[15-Mar-21 10:19 AM] Tattoblue#5828
hi fraxu


[15-Mar-21 11:58 AM] bonnie591#0591

[15-Mar-21 11:59 AM] bonnie591#0591
ah yes, an inactivity notice that started march 14th 10pm EST. totally excuses the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th!


[15-Mar-21 12:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
hello fraux!!


[15-Mar-21 12:18 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 am I actually allowed to have a little short meeting with seniors like in vc. I want to talk to them about gamenights and then I can inform them about Megan and quwanterz if I’m allowed


[15-Mar-21 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
They all noticed they are gone now


[15-Mar-21 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
But haven’t been informed of why


[15-Mar-21 12:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure what time


[15-Mar-21 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
Probably today around like 3, 4, or 5 est I can announce to them and let them vote on a time


[15-Mar-21 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
Ok I’ll do that now


[15-Mar-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Mar-21 12:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
@stacey


[15-Mar-21 12:31 PM] stacey#1000
Will you be able to join the meeting as well since I’ll be telling them about hosting public gamenights then after you can make the senior gamenight channel and give them permissions to type in gamenights and host once it’s done @bonnie591


[15-Mar-21 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
yup i can attend!


[15-Mar-21 12:31 PM] stacey#1000

That’s like


[15-Mar-21 12:32 PM] stacey#1000

[15-Mar-21 12:32 PM] stacey#1000
Or 8


[15-Mar-21 12:32 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah 7


[15-Mar-21 12:32 PM] stacey#1000
Your time doesn’t change?


[15-Mar-21 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
it changes in 2 weeks


[15-Mar-21 12:32 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think


[15-Mar-21 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
u always do it a week or two earlier than us for some reason idk


[15-Mar-21 12:33 PM] stacey#1000
That’s weird and confusing


[15-Mar-21 12:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah its always a pain for like 2 weeks per year especially if i wanna host


[15-Mar-21 12:36 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah rip


[15-Mar-21 01:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I literally DM’ed her twice too and she never said anything. I don’t know why she’s so surprised. I even included that she could face a possible demotion in regards to her activity strikes.


[15-Mar-21 01:07 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
smh


[15-Mar-21 01:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Quwanterz was actually chill about his.

huh. she wasnt very accepting of itlmao


[15-Mar-21 01:13 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yep but she had her chances and I gave her multiple times to improve. She obviously didn’t put any effort into doing that


[15-Mar-21 01:14 PM] courtney#5125
she hasnt even said a single thing in the discord server in over a month, let alone do anything in-game


[15-Mar-21 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
she literally seems to be trying to blame me


[15-Mar-21 01:27 PM] stacey#1000
idc if shes mad at me its her fault not mine


[15-Mar-21 01:57 PM] stacey#1000

o


[15-Mar-21 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
so megan dms me again and says she finds it unfair she was fired the day after she put a notice and thought you cant get fired if you have a notice


[15-Mar-21 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
.......


[15-Mar-21 04:32 PM] stacey#1000
then I changed the topic to firestone to not talk about it


[15-Mar-21 04:43 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
:facepalm_blob: is she not aware of the our 3 strike system


[15-Mar-21 04:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Just because she put a notice last minute up on Sunday doesn’t mean that covers for the whole week she did nothing. Either way she would of got her strike fair and square


[15-Mar-21 04:54 PM] cory!#8287
mhm, shes also been a senior for well over a year so she should be fully aware of senior activity


[15-Mar-21 04:55 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 @Bloo_Berriez also could one of you accept my promo opinion when you have the chance please, ty!


[15-Mar-21 04:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yes sir


[15-Mar-21 04:57 PM] cory!#8287
ty!!


[15-Mar-21 05:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
Putting an inactive notice that only covers 2 hours of the week she just did fuck all on


[15-Mar-21 05:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
Megan needs to grow up and realise she probabaly doesn't actually care too much about bloxton and just should leave it smh


[15-Mar-21 05:20 PM] stacey#1000
can I get opinions on this please https://trello.com/c/JzwqSmle/40059-blackstvrs-receptionist

r u sure


[16-Mar-21 04:11 PM] xM_inn#2821
Logan is a boba rep


[16-Mar-21 04:12 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont see him in the alliance rep channel and it shows in settings 0 ppl have the role


[16-Mar-21 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
settings arent reliable


[16-Mar-21 04:13 PM] bonnie591#0591
too many members = doesnt load everyone


[16-Mar-21 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
It says 1 person has boba rep role for me in settings


[16-Mar-21 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821

[16-Mar-21 04:16 PM] ethan;#0003

she's digging herself a hole


[16-Mar-21 04:19 PM] cory!#8287
was she doxxing someone


[16-Mar-21 04:19 PM] KjRBLX#2053
🤷‍♂️ I've never seen that GC before. but in another discord server..someone was pretty upset with her

@anna HEY ik u clear the mb a lot so have u encountered some duplicate cards and misspelling cards? cause im doing bans and like 5 of them were misspelled


[16-Mar-21 06:33 PM] anna#0004
yesss and what happens is they will misspell usernames and then another person will create a card with the same user but they spell it correctly which creates duplicates and stuff!!


[16-Mar-21 06:40 PM] cory!#8287
mhmm im probably gonna make an announcement abt it and tell them how to check for duplicates and how to counter misspellings and see if an improvement is made


[16-Mar-21 07:02 PM] anna#0004
yeah an announcement for it is probably best to be honest


[16-Mar-21 07:57 PM] cory!#8287
alr i made one, hopefully the errors will stop cause i was pretty specific in that announcement


[17-Mar-21 12:00 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[17-Mar-21 01:46 PM] stacey#1000
About something in fanart that shouldn’t be there and I said it was fine and she still said it shouldn’t be


[17-Mar-21 01:48 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 why do you even bother arguing with her that’s my question. She never changes


[17-Mar-21 01:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
honestly i want her fired aa


[17-Mar-21 01:49 PM] stacey#1000
She will literally never get shift that’s no question


[17-Mar-21 01:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
id actually resign


[17-Mar-21 01:49 PM] bonnie591#0591
or consider resignation


[17-Mar-21 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
Can’t she like get suspended for archiving stuff she shouldn’t


[17-Mar-21 01:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
she can be as active as she wants and as popular among everyone who isnt hr all she wants.. she isnt ever getting it


[17-Mar-21 01:50 PM] bonnie591#0591
i already dmed her, its too late to suspend


[17-Mar-21 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
Seniors aren’t supposed to be archiving notices like that


[17-Mar-21 01:50 PM] stacey#1000
Did you unarchive them?


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
she only archived one, i didnt unarchive it because well it did kinda need archiving and it wouldnt make sense to put it back up. either way she should of obtained permission


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
Like why did she archive the interview stuff-


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
it was old stuf


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
from 2018


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
She still shouldn’t have archived lol


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] bonnie591#0591
mhm


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] stacey#1000
What did you tell her tho


[17-Mar-21 01:51 PM] stacey#1000

That would be a problem


[17-Mar-21 01:53 PM] stacey#1000

[17-Mar-21 01:53 PM] stacey#1000
I’m waiting for when she resigns


[17-Mar-21 01:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
will she resign


[17-Mar-21 01:55 PM] bonnie591#0591

@cory! we can just limit the amount of sessions someone can go to per day


[17-Mar-21 02:01 PM] ethan;#0003
because its usually the same people


[17-Mar-21 02:02 PM] cory!#8287
how would we do that


[17-Mar-21 02:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
can they dm imag instead

[17-Mar-21 02:05 PM] lyss#0709
i dont think thats really fair, plus itd be more difficult to see who's going above and beyond with activity if everyone is limited to a certain number of sessions


[17-Mar-21 02:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
no limit but limit how early they can join


[17-Mar-21 02:05 PM] ethan;#0003
that dude has messaged everyone


[17-Mar-21 02:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well I made an announcement about Mrs going to sessions early yesterday night but apparently I got DMs that there’s still Mrs going over an hour early


[17-Mar-21 02:06 PM] lyss#0709
id agree with limiting when they can join, but not the amount of sessions they can go to


[17-Mar-21 02:06 PM] courtney#5125
idek y anyone would want to waste their time going over an hour early to sit in a roblox game and move ur mouse every 20 minutes so u dont disconnect


[17-Mar-21 02:06 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
my thoughts exactly.


[17-Mar-21 02:06 PM] cory!#8287
fr


[17-Mar-21 02:07 PM] cory!#8287
a limit wouldn’t hurt


[17-Mar-21 02:07 PM] cory!#8287
maybe like half an hour early


[17-Mar-21 02:07 PM] cory!#8287
like seniors have to wait half an hour early to ask to host


[17-Mar-21 02:08 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
The only thing with having that as a rule is people are going to fight on who got there first. If we set a limit no ones not gonna know who got there first or last if they’re all joining at same time


[17-Mar-21 02:09 PM] cory!#8287
you have a point


[17-Mar-21 02:09 PM] cory!#8287
maybe the host can decide who stays or not


[17-Mar-21 02:25 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve let there be 4 managers in my server


[17-Mar-21 02:25 PM] stacey#1000
I just assign who does what when it happens


[17-Mar-21 02:27 PM] stacey#1000
And this has been an issue for a long time tbh. I wrote a whole essay over this when I was a head. I’d be waiting there for 30 mins or so and be the first one there, then other heads join after and then I don’t get picked.


[17-Mar-21 02:27 PM] stacey#1000
This is why I let excess heads be back-up in my server


[17-Mar-21 02:28 PM] stacey#1000
Making this an official rule won’t really do much it will be hard to monitor it.


[17-Mar-21 02:28 PM] lyss#0709
honestly i wouldnt be against possibly changing the limit to 4 managers per server if that option is even on the table, plus it would make sense especially considering there's 4 stations and there's nothing wrong with having more hands on deck to check trainees

however it'd be difficult for servers with not many trainees since it'd be unnecessary to have 4 managers for 2 trainees


[17-Mar-21 02:28 PM] lyss#0709
idk though


[17-Mar-21 02:29 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I’ve let there be 4 on mine and I will continue to if needed


[17-Mar-21 02:30 PM] stacey#1000
It doesn’t happen often though


[17-Mar-21 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I don’t like the idea of making it a rule


[17-Mar-21 02:31 PM] stacey#1000
For the time limit thing


[17-Mar-21 02:32 PM] stacey#1000
I don’t see how we could monitor it


[17-Mar-21 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Because I for one am not going to be checking my session an hour or so ahead to see if people went there earlier


[17-Mar-21 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 how would we possible monitor it


[17-Mar-21 02:33 PM] stacey#1000
Possibly*


[17-Mar-21 02:34 PM] lyss#0709
yeah if we were to do a time limit sorta thing itd be difficult to monitor it


[17-Mar-21 02:35 PM] lyss#0709
itd really just be up to the managers to take responsibility and follow that rule, but i doubt all of them will take it upon themselves to obey it when there's no constant authority to keep track of it


[17-Mar-21 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
I’m voting yes on the 4 limit thing over the time limit thing


[17-Mar-21 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
It’s easier to monitor


[17-Mar-21 02:35 PM] stacey#1000
And makes more sense to me idk


[17-Mar-21 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
Plus I’ve already allowed 4 managers


[17-Mar-21 02:36 PM] stacey#1000
Because even on small server with less trainees the managers work it out well on who does what. One names trainer, other names helpers, etc


[17-Mar-21 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
@katie @emily tagging since you voting on the time limit thing. Do you know how we would monitor it?


[17-Mar-21 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
@cory!


[17-Mar-21 02:37 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 it’s confusing to me


[17-Mar-21 02:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
True but sometimes there isn’t always trainees for each station so at times having 4 managers would be useless. I mean I’m not against adjusting it to 4 managers. It’s just that I feel like there will be times when 4 managers isn’t needed


[17-Mar-21 02:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey well if we do that managers can only join 40-30 minutes prior, a way we can monitor it if the hosts get there earlier enough to see who joined first and dismiss whoever joined last. But idk if you guys would want to even get there that early. Or we could do what cory said and hosts can decide


[17-Mar-21 02:45 PM] lyss#0709
right that's my only issue with it--when there's only a couple of trainees and 4 managers, that would be unnecessary


[17-Mar-21 02:46 PM] lyss#0709
but at least more managers would get a chance to attend more sessions


[17-Mar-21 02:46 PM] stacey#1000
The thing about that is, legit I don’t want to go to sessions 45 mins early. I join 5 mins early at most. Plus when I host now. I host int at like 6, then training  at like 6:45, so I can’t even do that to wait that early.


[17-Mar-21 02:46 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah that’s the major issue we have is managers are complaining they aren’t able to get in servers since they get so full so fast


[17-Mar-21 02:47 PM] stacey#1000
With 4 managers in a small server it’s possible like I said above, managers are good at deciding who does what so it’s fair. One names, trainers, one names helpers, some do excess it works


[17-Mar-21 02:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah that’s the downside about having a time limit cause I can guarantee that there will be arguments about who got there first and then we have that issue cause we don’t have hosts there to decide.


[17-Mar-21 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
If we did the time limit thing I won’t be going to my sessions that early to monitor it. I don’t have time for that


[17-Mar-21 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
I really thing we should do 4 managers instead


[17-Mar-21 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
And it’s not even at every session it happens


[17-Mar-21 02:48 PM] stacey#1000
I’ve had to ask for managers at my sessions a lot too


[17-Mar-21 02:48 PM] cory!#8287
basically what bloo said for my idea but I wouldn’t mind 4 managers or a limit


[17-Mar-21 02:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
We can always test waters and see how that goes and if we don’t like 4 managers always bring it back down to 3


[17-Mar-21 02:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So I’ll vote yes for 4 managers


[17-Mar-21 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
The time limit thing will jsut go really bad trust me


[17-Mar-21 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
The seniors aren’t going to want to monitor that either


[17-Mar-21 02:49 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah


[17-Mar-21 02:49 PM] stacey#1000
I see no possible way the time limit would work.


[17-Mar-21 07:30 PM] ethan;#0003
if anything the time limit makes it more competing


[17-Mar-21 07:30 PM] ethan;#0003
because they would all be joining at the same time


[18-Mar-21 08:45 AM] courtney#5125
could a bod approve this? https://trello.com/c/LOsgS8CX/40096-dovealia-head-of-services


[18-Mar-21 09:03 AM] stacey#1000
We will be at max managers after if she does get promoted


[18-Mar-21 10:04 AM] ethan;#0003
has it even been a month since dovealia got head


[18-Mar-21 10:04 AM] ethan;#0003
oh 12/30


[18-Mar-21 10:06 AM] courtney#5125
ya its been a while and shes been active


[18-Mar-21 10:06 AM] courtney#5125
& several seniors agreed on her card on the senior board


[18-Mar-21 10:32 AM] stacey#1000
We need to start being more strict on who gets promoted to manager though


[18-Mar-21 10:32 AM] stacey#1000
We will be at max


[18-Mar-21 10:33 AM] stacey#1000
Do we need more managers right now?


[18-Mar-21 11:42 AM] bonnie591#0591
sure


[18-Mar-21 12:25 PM] cory!#8287
@stacey i recommend not promoting blackstvrs anymore

[18-Mar-21 01:07 PM] lyss#0709
woah wtf


[18-Mar-21 01:31 PM] ethan;#0003
bruh why do mrs block people to make more servers on interviews


[18-Mar-21 01:31 PM] ethan;#0003
it just gets to the point where there is like 5 servers with 10 people in it


[18-Mar-21 01:31 PM] ethan;#0003
and i tell them its not being hosted because there is more mrs then guests

[18-Mar-21 01:34 PM] ethan;#0003
there was another one


[18-Mar-21 01:34 PM] ethan;#0003
i went in and shut it down


[18-Mar-21 01:34 PM] ethan;#0003
because it was just one mr sitting in a server byhimself


[18-Mar-21 01:42 PM] cory!#8287
I’ve noticed it too but I didn’t know that was the reason


[18-Mar-21 01:43 PM] ethan;#0003
I learned that people could do that from firestone cus people would block people to get into a tiny server to money farm

[18-Mar-21 01:43 PM] ethan;#0003
matt was in a server by himself


[18-Mar-21 01:43 PM] ethan;#0003
i shut it down


[18-Mar-21 01:43 PM] ethan;#0003
and he said he blocked people to get into it


[18-Mar-21 01:44 PM] cory!#8287
yeah id make an announcement cause the server won’t even get hosted anyway so what’s the point in doing that 😐


[18-Mar-21 01:45 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont let my servers get hosted if there isnt a 2:1 ratio of guests to mrs


[18-Mar-21 01:45 PM] ethan;#0003
and when they do that the servers dont get hosted because its like 7 guests and 8 mrs


[18-Mar-21 01:45 PM] ethan;#0003
when the main server is still like only 30 players full


[18-Mar-21 01:46 PM] cory!#8287
I only let seniors host servers if there’s 20 interviewees


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I didn’t even know you could do that. I haven’t hosted in the last week so I wouldn’t know yeah. Idk when it became such a huge problem but I’ve been getting DMs of how there’s still so many MRs going to sessions an hour early and how it’s getting full an hour early.


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] cory!#8287
cause that’s basically 20 people


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003
imag does it EVERY session


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003
because she asks to late


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
People are getting desperate


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003
and i say like server 6


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003
and randomly a server with just her pops upo


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003
and she expects to host an interview server with 8 mrs and 3 guests


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Imag ALWAYS asks so late I’m like :mreally:


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] cory!#8287
yeah it gets annoying at times


[18-Mar-21 01:47 PM] ethan;#0003
i always have to tell her to send the guests to my server


[18-Mar-21 01:48 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
SHe’s asking me like 5 minutes before it starts sometimes I don’t reply cause it’s obvious all of the servers have hosts


[18-Mar-21 01:48 PM] ethan;#0003
because the 3 other tiny servers have people and the main one is like 20/50


[18-Mar-21 01:48 PM] ethan;#0003

30 people


[18-Mar-21 01:48 PM] ethan;#0003
if they let servers fill up normally it would be 50


[18-Mar-21 01:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
hiring loads of new mrs is great but now we have a full management limit and too many mrs


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] cory!#8287
the main server should be full before another server forms in my opinion


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] ethan;#0003
yes i agree


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] ethan;#0003
we have too many mrs


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] cory!#8287
I agree


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] ethan;#0003
they need to go to the hotel more instead of going to trainigns and interviews so much


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] ethan;#0003
bceause i can bet, atleast 50% only go to the hotel once a week


[18-Mar-21 01:49 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003
if we had that hyra bot we could check how long someone is at the hotel for each week, or when they go, but baby and bear dont want that


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] cory!#8287
like I’ve hosted 3 training servers once and it was always cheif poky and luke in the main server


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003

[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003

[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003
CHEIF AND POKY


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003
they get there


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003
like


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003
HOURS


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] cory!#8287
like always them


[18-Mar-21 01:50 PM] ethan;#0003
early


[18-Mar-21 01:51 PM] lyss#0709
elias too


[18-Mar-21 01:51 PM] cory!#8287
that’s why I join smaller servers now


[18-Mar-21 01:51 PM] lyss#0709
always does that


[18-Mar-21 01:51 PM] cory!#8287
cause I wanna see new mrs train and do their duties instead of just them


[18-Mar-21 01:51 PM] ethan;#0003
there needs to be something to track actrivity


[18-Mar-21 01:51 PM] ethan;#0003
at the hotel


[18-Mar-21 01:52 PM] cory!#8287
mhm


[18-Mar-21 01:52 PM] ethan;#0003
And then when someone doesnt get the amount of time at the hotel they need per week


[18-Mar-21 01:52 PM] ethan;#0003
they get striked or warned


[18-Mar-21 01:52 PM] ethan;#0003
and strikes lead to suspensions


[18-Mar-21 01:52 PM] ethan;#0003
or something like that


[18-Mar-21 01:52 PM] ethan;#0003
because thats the only thing i can see that can balance out the activity at the hotel and trainings/interviews is if we keep track of it with a bot


[18-Mar-21 01:53 PM] ethan;#0003
ik thats what a lot of groups do


[18-Mar-21 01:53 PM] ethan;#0003
They have bots that track how long a player is in the game for, and then weekly they are added up and if they dont meet the requirement they are warned or striked


[18-Mar-21 01:54 PM] cory!#8287
I agree


[18-Mar-21 01:54 PM] cory!#8287
it’s always the same MRs that I see go to sessions and they never let other ones join


[18-Mar-21 01:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
YES


[18-Mar-21 01:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
OMG


[18-Mar-21 01:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
it’s always them


[18-Mar-21 01:55 PM] ethan;#0003
bloo


[18-Mar-21 01:55 PM] ethan;#0003
what r ur thoughts on activity tracking


[18-Mar-21 01:55 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
And Lee has been DM’ing photos on how Chief is getting to trainings 2 HOURS early


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] ethan;#0003
lee is always asking me if he can come


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] ethan;#0003
cus he said he can never go


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] ethan;#0003
because peopel get there so early


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Activity tracking who


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] ethan;#0003
mrs arent going to the hotel as much as they should


[18-Mar-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
and if we had activity tracking to see how long they where at the hotel for


[18-Mar-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
it can be enforced


[18-Mar-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
and that would mean more mrs at the hotel instead of at trainigns


[18-Mar-21 01:57 PM] ethan;#0003
because currently they dont need to go to the hotel, or they can just lie on the manager board saying they where at the hotel


[18-Mar-21 01:58 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Oh yeah definitely that’s something that would be really helpful but wouldn’t we need like baby to script something out  that tracks who goes to hotel and for how long etc


[18-Mar-21 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
there is that thing hyra but baby and bear said they dont want to use it


[18-Mar-21 01:59 PM] ethan;#0003
that i brought up in a meeting once with ryan and he tried to convince them but they dont want to


[18-Mar-21 01:59 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah I remember that


[18-Mar-21 02:00 PM] ethan;#0003
if we use it keeps track of the amount of time someone spends at the hotel, inactivity notices, rank logs


[18-Mar-21 02:09 PM] cory!#8287
maybe since they made the command !lrattendance and !attendance at sessions they could try and add !startshift and !endshift at the hotel. the only problem with this tho is mrs could prob use private servers to cheat the system


[18-Mar-21 02:09 PM] cory!#8287
but idk just an idea


[18-Mar-21 02:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
we need to have some like reservation system


[18-Mar-21 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
at this point


[18-Mar-21 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
lets say


[18-Mar-21 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
its opens an hour before


[18-Mar-21 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
then u join like 20 minutes before


[18-Mar-21 02:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
thats just an example


[18-Mar-21 02:23 PM] ethan;#0003

u know if we hired 2 hrs


[18-Mar-21 02:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
drizzle and acel


[18-Mar-21 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
we could have it so


[18-Mar-21 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
theres interviews and trainings every hour pretty much


[18-Mar-21 02:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
then mrs can choose where


[18-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I even tried joining chief yesterday cause she was there so early and being like “Soooo you’re here early”


[18-Mar-21 02:29 PM] ethan;#0003
@bonnie591 can u convince baby and bear to made a activity tracking thing where hrs can see how long mrs are at the hotel for


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
ive tried for years sir


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
🙄


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] ethan;#0003
UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591

[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591

ace and imag :GloxiniaSmirk:


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
omg imag!


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
a problematic hr team 😌


[18-Mar-21 02:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
It would be nice to having something like Venti does tbh


[18-Mar-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
the way venti does it they do a command on the discord and it tells how long they have been in the game the entire week and total time ever and how long they are there each shift


[18-Mar-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
and i still think we should ally with venti


[18-Mar-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
😄


[18-Mar-21 02:31 PM] ethan;#0003
it would be very cool!!!


[18-Mar-21 02:32 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’m impressed cause it’s been almost about a year since their group got hacked and everyone got kicked yet here not even a year later with like what 120k members? Idk how much they actually have that was just a guess lol


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
it hasnt even been a year


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
or maybe it is a year like this month


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah this month will be a year


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
The end of it I think


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
march 31st


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
is when they got hacked


[18-Mar-21 02:33 PM] ethan;#0003
beacuse on april 1st they where supposed to release a new version


[18-Mar-21 03:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
LOL


[18-Mar-21 03:14 PM] KjRBLX#2053
BLOCKING PEOPLE TO MAKE A NEW SERVER?


[18-Mar-21 03:25 PM] courtney#5125
whod be our second hr?


[18-Mar-21 03:25 PM] courtney#5125
drizzle??


[18-Mar-21 03:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
believe so


[18-Mar-21 03:26 PM] KjRBLX#2053
🤷‍♂️


[18-Mar-21 03:26 PM] courtney#5125

[18-Mar-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
For me it’s hard to decide between drizzle and maya for second HR


[18-Mar-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
Both are really active and can help their time zones


[18-Mar-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
I think ace and drizzle


[18-Mar-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
And then down the road maya


[18-Mar-21 04:03 PM] courtney#5125
i agree


[18-Mar-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 if we get 2 new HRs can we get 3-4 new seniors?


[18-Mar-21 04:10 PM] bonnie591#0591
Mhm I asked baby that


[18-Mar-21 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
Oki


[18-Mar-21 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
Also did Saab reply to you?


[18-Mar-21 04:10 PM] stacey#1000
About her activity


[18-Mar-21 04:11 PM] stacey#1000
Cause if she can’t be active we should demote for inactivity


[18-Mar-21 04:14 PM] bonnie591#0591
No reply as of yet


[18-Mar-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
How long it been since you sent it? Cause that’s saying she is inactive and we can demote ,


[18-Mar-21 04:20 PM] cory!#8287
what about omer? hes been a senior since 2019 and hes been active for a while


[18-Mar-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
He’s had issues with maturity and hasn’t been fully active. I never see him active tbh


[18-Mar-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
There are other seniors that are way more active


[18-Mar-21 04:30 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe next time


[18-Mar-21 04:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
I think drizzle and acel this time


[18-Mar-21 04:58 PM] stacey#1000
If we were allowed to get 4 new seniors I would vote Tati, Addie, Emma, Jacki


[18-Mar-21 05:23 PM] cory!#8287
same or ttarjei


[18-Mar-21 05:30 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes Tati has improved a lot


[18-Mar-21 06:53 PM] lyss#0709
a lot of the mrs are still joining sessions over an hour or so early, and when theyre told not to do that they use the argument that its not a rule


[18-Mar-21 06:55 PM] lyss#0709
im pretty sure a lot of them are assuming its more on the optional side


[18-Mar-21 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
It would just be hard to monitor it if it was a rule.


[18-Mar-21 08:05 PM] stacey#1000
We could make it a rule and then if we notice it kick those that violate it and warn them or something


[18-Mar-21 08:05 PM] courtney#5125
its annoying that we need to make things a set in stone rule just for it to be followed


[18-Mar-21 08:06 PM] courtney#5125
theres been several announcements on the subject already


[18-Mar-21 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
Well there is enough votes on making it a rule and enough votes on making the manager limit 4 so


[18-Mar-21 08:06 PM] stacey#1000
We just need to announce it now really


[18-Mar-21 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
And then if we see people violating it, kick them and warn them I guess


[18-Mar-21 08:07 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i suppose so


[18-Mar-21 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez need BOD approval sir


[18-Mar-21 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
Can we announce this and make them official. We got enough votes ^^


[18-Mar-21 08:07 PM] stacey#1000
For manager limit set to 4 and then the rule for time limit


[18-Mar-21 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
Also if we are going to announce it I don’t want to announce it


[18-Mar-21 08:10 PM] stacey#1000
So if anyone else wants to feel free


[18-Mar-21 08:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
🙂 I mean who wouldn't wanna announce that


[18-Mar-21 08:12 PM] KjRBLX#2053
That's like cutting the rope at a grand opening.


[18-Mar-21 08:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@stacey Yes for the time limits. For the 4 manager limit, I think we should wait on that and see how this time limiting goes because the whole reason managers complained about not getting in was because of managers who got there like 1 hour and 30 minutes early.


[18-Mar-21 08:28 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Uhm how restrictive is it going to be, 40 minutes? 50 minutes?


[18-Mar-21 08:29 PM] stacey#1000
40 minutes


[18-Mar-21 08:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Okay


[18-Mar-21 08:29 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Anyone wanna announce it, if not I can but won’t be until later

:bloxton3: **__Going to Sessions Early__** :bloxton3: 

Greetings, MR Team! 

> As you're all aware, a few days ago I made an announcement regarding the rising issue of MRs arriving at trainings or interviews more than hour early. While the announcement was only issued as a strong recommendation to avoid waiting at session's for long periods of time prior to it starting, it appears as the issue still is lingering around.

> Therefore effective immediately, the High-Rank team has agreed on introducing a new rule. That rule being you're no longer able to arrive at a training or interview session until 40 minutes prior to its start. Let me say that again, you may begin to arrive 40 minutes prior to its starting time whether it's a training or interview session.

**What does this mean?**
> No more arriving an hour, or hour and a half early as there is no need to be there that early. We want you guys to instead utilize your time on other things like going to the hotel during that time period, or whatever it may be that you do. 

**What is the reason for this new rule?**
> This new rule has been implemented to ensure we give our whole MR team a fair and reasonable wait time before a session starts. No one should be waiting an hour and a half for a session to commence. We want everyone to get an equal the opportunity to attend a session without it being full an hour early. 

> With this new rule, we hope it provides you with some ease of not having to worry about getting to sessions so early and waiting for long periods of time.


[19-Mar-21 03:17 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
how does this look, anything i possibly missed that i should include in the announcement regarding this new rule? if so just tag me if not lmk if it's good to post!

hopefully it will be released over the weekend


[19-Mar-21 10:30 AM] courtney#5125
anyone opposed to renfully (Renster_HD) receiving the former role or should he appeal for it? he said he was unbanned from the discord server a month ago


[19-Mar-21 10:34 AM] anna#0004
if he lost his former because of being banned then ya but if his former was taken separately from the ban then probs appeal for it


[19-Mar-21 10:41 AM] courtney#5125
sounds good!


[19-Mar-21 11:46 AM] ethan;#0003
This will effect ranking in game

[19-Mar-21 12:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Prob should make a seperate passers list so the bot doesnt try to rank

@bonnie591


[19-Mar-21 12:09 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes sir ty


[19-Mar-21 12:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
@courtney did vac and acel save their passers and send it to u


[19-Mar-21 12:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
and did u save ur passers


[19-Mar-21 12:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
or no


[19-Mar-21 12:25 PM] courtney#5125
i saved my passers and vac sent his to me, jess never told me if she had a problem with ranking & i didnt receive any dms from her


[19-Mar-21 12:26 PM] courtney#5125
ill ask her if she saved them. she might not even know that ranking is down. when you press the rank button it says theyre ranked but they dont actually get ranked


[19-Mar-21 12:27 PM] KjRBLX#2053
mhm


[19-Mar-21 12:31 PM] courtney#5125
she said it worked for her at the time, she just pressed the button several times


[19-Mar-21 12:31 PM] courtney#5125
not working anymore tho ig


[19-Mar-21 12:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
lol


[19-Mar-21 12:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
@courtney they wont of been ranked. we can get the user ids from #rank-logs anyway so no worires


[19-Mar-21 12:51 PM] courtney#5125
she said she refreshed them and they were the correct rank


[19-Mar-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm


[19-Mar-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
i checked their rank and they are still their former rank @courtney


[19-Mar-21 01:23 PM] courtney#5125
huh, idk why she said it worked then


[19-Mar-21 01:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[19-Mar-21 01:31 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 so we’ll rank the passers for our sessions when it comes back online?


[19-Mar-21 01:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
yup!


[19-Mar-21 01:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
either by group admin or #bot_commands


[19-Mar-21 01:31 PM] cory!#8287
ok


[19-Mar-21 01:37 PM] cory!#8287
@bonnie591 shouldn’t seniors do the HRs username instead of theirs cause it’s gonna be confusing finding which ones are ours


[19-Mar-21 01:39 PM] bonnie591#0591
eh doesnt matter since letting hrs rank their own can lead to days of waiting


[19-Mar-21 01:39 PM] cory!#8287
alrighty!

ok so what topic do u want first


[19-Mar-21 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
okay


[19-Mar-21 01:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
votes or trey


[19-Mar-21 01:58 PM] stacey#1000
trey


[19-Mar-21 01:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
ok


[19-Mar-21 01:58 PM] ethan;#0003
trey


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
I get trey cant get senior or any ever again I didnt think that but I thought he'd be allowed to at least become a head or management then just be ranked locked to that rank.


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
my question is:


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
what about other MRs that were terminated then got promoted again?


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] stacey#1000
we have done it before


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] ethan;#0003
Yeah


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] ethan;#0003
Moody was fired wasnt he


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] ethan;#0003
he got senior


[19-Mar-21 02:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Indeed, but they wouldn't of got it as fast correct?


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] ethan;#0003
Trey has worked her since the day he got unbanned


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] ethan;#0003
That is longer then most of the people who have gotten promoted in the past 2 months


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
Moody got promoted to head again within like 5 months


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
For Trey its been like 6+ months


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
Another question:


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] ethan;#0003
The people who have gotten promoted in the past 1-2 months some have only worked here for 3 months maybe


[19-Mar-21 02:04 PM] stacey#1000
would he be allowed to be promoted to at least head or management, then be rank locked to never get senior or HR?


[19-Mar-21 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
or at least rank 9, then be ranked locked to rank 9


[19-Mar-21 02:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Baby doesn't like the idea of that unfortunately, he'd rather him be LR instead of promoting him to a certain rank and then limiting him.


[19-Mar-21 02:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Especially if there's another LR that deserves Head of Services


[19-Mar-21 02:05 PM] stacey#1000
Okay, and what do we tell MRs that keep promotion recommending him?


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] stacey#1000
like imag for example.....


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] cory!#8287
will he at least be allowed to get honor member if he resigns from bar


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
We don't have to tell them anything, just archive the card saying "Confidential reasons, please don't re-add"


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
We don't really give honor member to those who we fire


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
But it's up to Baby


[19-Mar-21 02:06 PM] cory!#8287
o


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] cory!#8287
okay


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
Thinking about it, I dont really think Trey should get promoted anyways because he usually gets involved with stuff he shouldnt as if he was still an HR.


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sounds like flyro


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
So we arent allowed to tell MRs he can never get promoted?


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
or at least seniors


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] stacey#1000
cause its mostly seniors that keep asking


[19-Mar-21 02:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well if we told MRs it might spread towards him and I don't think we should really do it. Just say confidential reasons and we should be fine


[19-Mar-21 02:08 PM] stacey#1000
Okay


[19-Mar-21 02:08 PM] stacey#1000
thats all questions I have regarding trey

[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
So if the new rank limit for managers is 60 do we have to wait until the number drops back under to 60 to promo another manager


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
ty kj


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
so we need to fire inactive managers right?


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yup


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] stacey#1000
so update on saab?


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
We don't need to fire them instantly Stacey


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
We just can't promote anymore till we get to 59 managers


[19-Mar-21 02:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll give Saab until Sunday to reply as that will be a week since I sent her the dm


[19-Mar-21 02:16 PM] stacey#1000
Okay

[19-Mar-21 02:16 PM] ethan;#0003
what about new alliances? have they said anything about that?


[19-Mar-21 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
If we do hire new seniors we can get manager down to 60


[19-Mar-21 02:16 PM] cory!#8287
65 managers is clearly a lot


[19-Mar-21 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
I didn't ask about that Ethan, I can do it next time thoug


[19-Mar-21 02:16 PM] bonnie591#0591

[19-Mar-21 02:17 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Ikr ima make my announcement rn about that to mrs


[19-Mar-21 02:17 PM] cory!#8287
alright


[19-Mar-21 02:17 PM] stacey#1000
Whats the senior limit


[19-Mar-21 02:17 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's unlikely we'll get 2 new shifts and 3-4 new seniors, but I'll try for it. If we aren't allowed that, then we'll just hire 1 new shift and 1-2 new seniors, then hire the others at a later time


[19-Mar-21 02:18 PM] bonnie591#0591
Baby prefers senior to be at 20, but the limit is at 25 if we really need to use it


[19-Mar-21 02:18 PM] stacey#1000
ok and are we going to do something about like how long people can go inactive or something


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes we'll work on that


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
you mentioned like 3 months minimum allowed or something before


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
ok


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
yeah


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] stacey#1000
we need seniors the most


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll try to convince him to do 2 though


[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] stacey#1000

[19-Mar-21 02:19 PM] cory!#8287
mhm that’s fine


[19-Mar-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ok I'll mention that to him Stacey


[19-Mar-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'd say it's unlikely we'll get more than 2 seniors


[19-Mar-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
But we can always hire another 2 like in a month


[19-Mar-21 02:20 PM] ethan;#0003
mention about allies also pls


[19-Mar-21 02:20 PM] bonnie591#0591

[19-Mar-21 02:20 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

no I already mentioned when we spoke last month that going to baby and bear is the final stage of an alliance process and I never said I was speaking to them immediately, we have to do reviews and discussions first. there is no point going and just asking if we can get more allies, we need a strategic plan. We need actual groups, who meet the requirements, and are going to benefit us by becoming allies with us. once we have those groups, and have completed reviews and discussions within the HR team about them, we can write-up a final review to submit to baby and bear and submit a formal request for a new alliance.

what I will say is I don't think we need many new alliances, at the most 1-2 or maybe 3 if excellent choice, and baby and bear also don't want to have too many alliances. I think we should by all means branch out and look for new groups who could be potential alliances, but we should hire alliances based on quality not just for the sake of filling an alliance spot. we should also try start improving our current affiliate relations with our current alliances and seeing if we could coordinate some collaborative events with one another or something idk. we will see.

yeah i noticed the name but aivdan could of also just given the account to him


[20-Mar-21 09:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
or im forgetting a detail from aivdans termination


[20-Mar-21 09:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@KjRBLX  he was a troll that got mr on


[20-Mar-21 09:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[20-Mar-21 09:42 PM] Tattoblue#5828

I must of forgot because I had that mansion stuff to deal with.


[20-Mar-21 09:49 PM] cory!#8287
oh


[20-Mar-21 09:49 PM] cory!#8287
they should probably get a written warning


[20-Mar-21 09:50 PM] cory!#8287
or a strict verbal warning


[20-Mar-21 10:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Question, when someone was banned for 9 warnings, when they appeal do we clear all their warnings? Seems my resources doesn't have any instructions on how to deal with that.


[21-Mar-21 12:33 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
@cory! did you ever warn Roy about it


[21-Mar-21 12:34 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Was that after the session? @lyss


[21-Mar-21 12:37 AM] lyss#0709
yeah, mendo said they were taking a picture at the end and then roy just started doing that randomly @Bloo_Berriez


[21-Mar-21 12:39 AM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I’d say give him a written warning since that’s the 2nd time he’s done that. If he does it again then probs suspension. Although I’m not sure if Cory sent a verbal warning or not for the pic he sent up a bit. Put up a vote @lyss


[21-Mar-21 12:49 AM] lyss#0709
got it


[21-Mar-21 07:31 AM] cory!#8287
I didn’t give them a verbal warning


[21-Mar-21 08:01 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah


[21-Mar-21 09:42 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Ty


[21-Mar-21 11:01 AM] lyss#0709
does someone else want to give roy his warning? i'm pretty close friends with him so i think it'd be difficult


[21-Mar-21 11:01 AM] courtney#5125
sure!


[21-Mar-21 11:02 AM] lyss#0709
yayy thank uuu


[21-Mar-21 11:03 AM] courtney#5125
np!!


[21-Mar-21 01:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
I guess suspend for 3 days like we do to lrs, disappointing to see an mr do it @Tattoblue


[21-Mar-21 01:48 PM] cory!#8287
@Tattoblue I got a report for the same exact thing like on the 15th and she was just reporting that person cause Apple sent her the proof


[21-Mar-21 01:49 PM] cory!#8287
idk abt the other dude but the apple one wasn’t stealing


[21-Mar-21 02:28 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@cory! ya same thing happened here


[21-Mar-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
U know since like


[21-Mar-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
It's gonna be rare to promote people to manager now


[21-Mar-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
Should we do manager votes in future


[21-Mar-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
It'll work similar to senior votes


[21-Mar-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
So we all agree on who's the best fit for the one spot that will be open


[21-Mar-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
@High Rank


[21-Mar-21 04:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can go back to normal if manager isn't full for a while


[21-Mar-21 04:39 PM] anna#0004
yesss


[21-Mar-21 04:41 PM] courtney#5125
yeah that might be a good idea for a while at least, since spots will be limited we'll want the best heads for that open spot


[21-Mar-21 04:56 PM] cory!#8287
agreed I wouldn’t mind


[21-Mar-21 05:08 PM] stacey#1000
@High Rank I added some people to promotion opinions if anyone wants to claim them as I don't wish to promote them. I didn't do the full background checks. This was based off MRs suggestions so if you do, make sure to look into them more.

@bonnie591 i can re announce if uwant


[21-Mar-21 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
What’s the point of announcing it over and over again. It just keeps happening no matter how many times it’s announced


[21-Mar-21 07:32 PM] stacey#1000
Even after I announced it last time. It happened still a couple days after


[21-Mar-21 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
We can’t force everyone to be friends


[21-Mar-21 07:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
Sure! Thank you Anna. Please include in the announcement "**This isn't directed at anyone in particular, this is for everyone***"


[21-Mar-21 07:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can try though Stacey


[21-Mar-21 07:33 PM] stacey#1000
It never works usually


[21-Mar-21 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
There is always MRs that complain about it. But if they don’t speak up we can’t do anything


[21-Mar-21 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
We can’t force them all to be friends


[21-Mar-21 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
It’s up to them to speak up as well.


[21-Mar-21 07:34 PM] bonnie591#0591
We can't force them to be friends, all we want is for them to talk to each other and don't leave people out


[21-Mar-21 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
Ik


[21-Mar-21 07:35 PM] stacey#1000
But it always happens no matter how many times it’s announced


[21-Mar-21 07:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
Maybe it will be different this time! We'll see

@xM_inn what me to re-announce what I said before


[23-Mar-21 03:36 PM] xM_inn#2821
sure


[23-Mar-21 03:40 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn what Matt is talking about is when people where saying that people where so desperate to get into servers they would block to create new ones. I saw them saying it, it was nowhere near directed toward him


[23-Mar-21 03:40 PM] ethan;#0003
But Matt knows that he is one of the people who creates new servers


[23-Mar-21 03:40 PM] ethan;#0003
Because I confronted him last week about it


[23-Mar-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn BOD approval to make the manager limit 4?


[23-Mar-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
@cory! can u let 4 managers help on your server?


[23-Mar-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
addie been trying to get into one


[23-Mar-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
and I feel bad


[23-Mar-21 03:44 PM] cory!#8287
yes!


[23-Mar-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
ill tell addie to go to your server


[23-Mar-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk


[23-Mar-21 03:46 PM] Polk#1596

[23-Mar-21 03:47 PM] stacey#1000
ok im announcing to managers now ty


[23-Mar-21 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
i made the managers happy


[23-Mar-21 03:52 PM] stacey#1000
they seem to love the rule


[23-Mar-21 03:56 PM] Polk#1596
:D


[23-Mar-21 03:57 PM] Polk#1596
glad to hear that


[23-Mar-21 05:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
*waits*


[23-Mar-21 05:01 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Waiting for what


[23-Mar-21 05:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Mr. Polk, Board of Directors, is typing.


[23-Mar-21 05:02 PM] Polk#1596
@High Rank im a little outdated on the rules, so i need to ask if you guys

- pban for major glitching if they glitch 3 times in a server
- warn for glitching, then pban for major glitching if they reach 3 kicks


[23-Mar-21 05:02 PM] Polk#1596
because im hearing people are pbanning if someone glitches 3 times in a server


[23-Mar-21 05:02 PM] Polk#1596
and im 99% sure baby and bear wouldnt be so happy about how strict that is


[23-Mar-21 05:02 PM] ethan;#0003
it should be major glitching is an instant ban like if they get into the staff room, but minor like glitching in the fish tank should be a kick/warning


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
im fine with that


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
Huh


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] stacey#1000
I never banned for that


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
cus 3 warnings for a major glitcher is too many


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
and they would abuse it


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
well lee is saying its a thing


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] Polk#1596
and everyone does it


[23-Mar-21 05:03 PM] ethan;#0003
and be like "YOU KICKED ME WITHOUIT THREE WARNINGS IM REPORTING YOU"


[23-Mar-21 05:04 PM] Polk#1596
well the thing is


[23-Mar-21 05:04 PM] Polk#1596
im pretty sure baby and bear want it to be as lenient as possible if they arent a direct threat such as a bypasser or a major spammer, aka ruining the gameplay


[23-Mar-21 05:05 PM] Polk#1596
so we need some clarification on that rule


[23-Mar-21 05:05 PM] Polk#1596
ok so what you guys are saying is you dont pban for glitching, but you kick them instead?


[23-Mar-21 05:05 PM] ethan;#0003
idk how bad the glitching problem is anymore


[23-Mar-21 05:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Theres no harm with glitching into the fish tank


[23-Mar-21 05:06 PM] bonnie591#0591
Shouldn't even be a warning, let them be a fish


[23-Mar-21 05:06 PM] Polk#1596
🐟


[23-Mar-21 05:06 PM] Polk#1596
ok let me set up a poll with a few suggestions


[23-Mar-21 05:06 PM] ethan;#0003
thats fine ig


[23-Mar-21 05:06 PM] ethan;#0003
but we should ask the mrs how often and what type of glitches they see people do


[23-Mar-21 05:07 PM] ethan;#0003
cus i dont go to the hotel often


[23-Mar-21 05:07 PM] ethan;#0003
so i am not one to know what they do when they glitch


[23-Mar-21 05:23 PM] stacey#1000
I only ban them if they keep glitching into the receptionist lines or into peoples rooms


[24-Mar-21 01:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
Oh wow alright


[24-Mar-21 01:31 AM] xM_inn#2821
Sorry I went to sleep yes if u still need approval sure

[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] ethan;#0003
that was probs when he was mr for a day and got demoted


[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] ethan;#0003

[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] bonnie591#0591

[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
💀


[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] ethan;#0003
idk but he has matured since then


[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] xM_inn#2821
COMECALA I remember him being a head when I was a head in 2018


[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] ethan;#0003

[24-Mar-21 12:14 PM] bonnie591#0591

[24-Mar-21 12:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
still i dont think thats even ban worthy now pft


[24-Mar-21 12:15 PM] ethan;#0003
that bloxlink bans alts


[24-Mar-21 12:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
its been like it for


[24-Mar-21 12:15 PM] bonnie591#0591
1-2 months now


[24-Mar-21 12:15 PM] ethan;#0003
oh


[24-Mar-21 12:15 PM] ethan;#0003
i never noticed


[24-Mar-21 12:16 PM] ethan;#0003
because it probs bans if its on the same IP


[24-Mar-21 12:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
theres a command we can run to get the existing people in the server out if they are ban evading which will screw everyone over but personally i dont think thats a good idea


[24-Mar-21 12:16 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think if they link the same account

I believe I should mention this. I believe Roy has been getting like these just unnecessary stern talking to's from Canary.


[25-Mar-21 12:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
He stays it started when Mia was being unprofessional in a ticket and he asked her to stop and canary decided to jump in.

But the message she deleted when he started recording


[25-Mar-21 12:48 PM] KjRBLX#2053
But, I have a feeling that it might of been this message that he replied to with stop

[26-Mar-21 07:45 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'm so done with his shit I'm just gonna block

Threatening... :what:


[26-Mar-21 07:46 PM] KjRBLX#2053
maybe i was a threat to his ego


[26-Mar-21 07:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
He's so problematic


[26-Mar-21 07:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
He literally just needs to move on now


[26-Mar-21 07:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
It should be clear that he is no longer welcome in our community


[26-Mar-21 07:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053
What's his discord?


[26-Mar-21 07:49 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[27-Mar-21 06:27 PM] stacey#1000
Huh


[27-Mar-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
So they divided up who names what, like 1 does reception, 1 does security so on?


[27-Mar-21 06:28 PM] stacey#1000
What’s wrong with that.....? Can’t control the number of trainees in each section.


[27-Mar-21 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
@KjRBLX


[27-Mar-21 06:29 PM] stacey#1000
What’s he complaining  about exactly


[27-Mar-21 06:30 PM] katie#0200
wait did someone claim all of services when there's 3 managers in the server?


[27-Mar-21 06:30 PM] stacey#1000
Oh was there 3 managers and not 4?


[27-Mar-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
If we have to we can decide who does what if needed.


[27-Mar-21 06:31 PM] stacey#1000
Just name them who does what


[27-Mar-21 06:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm


[27-Mar-21 06:45 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[27-Mar-21 08:37 PM] cory!#8287
are hosts allowed to kick people for saying #excess


[27-Mar-21 08:37 PM] cory!#8287
cause erick does it.....


[27-Mar-21 08:38 PM] stacey#1000
That was something slee use to do


[27-Mar-21 08:39 PM] stacey#1000
But if it’s an official rule idk


[27-Mar-21 08:39 PM] stacey#1000
Kinda strict


[27-Mar-21 08:53 PM] cory!#8287
not sure why hosts do it cause as u said its strict


[27-Mar-21 08:53 PM] cory!#8287
and also kinda unnecessary in my opinion


[27-Mar-21 09:19 PM] courtney#5125
yeah they shouldnt. i remember daisy used to do it when she was a senior and we decided that wasnt allowed so i dmed her to not to it


[27-Mar-21 09:19 PM] courtney#5125
*not to do it


[27-Mar-21 10:52 PM] ethan;#0003
Chief isn’t allowed to do that


[27-Mar-21 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
Mrs used to claim multiple ranks to name


[27-Mar-21 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
So one person would be naming 10 and the other 2 would be naming 1 each


[27-Mar-21 10:53 PM] ethan;#0003
It was announced they can’t do that or they would get in trouble


[27-Mar-21 10:54 PM] ethan;#0003
@KjRBLX ^


[27-Mar-21 10:54 PM] courtney#5125
ya managers need to be splitting up ranks fairly


[27-Mar-21 10:54 PM] ethan;#0003
Chief also hogs session spots


[27-Mar-21 10:54 PM] ethan;#0003
Lee tells me


[27-Mar-21 10:54 PM] ethan;#0003
She gets there so early


[27-Mar-21 10:54 PM] ethan;#0003
Like hours


[27-Mar-21 10:55 PM] courtney#5125
i dont think thats true, ive seen her arrive 30-40 minutes early tops at my sessions


[27-Mar-21 10:55 PM] ethan;#0003
Always goes to ONLY trainings and is ONLY in the first server


[27-Mar-21 10:55 PM] courtney#5125
however she is always in the first server ^^


[27-Mar-21 10:55 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk she was inactive for so long


[27-Mar-21 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
She got promoted to manager


[27-Mar-21 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
Went dead inactive for months


[27-Mar-21 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
And when she got promoted we got reports of her leaking


[27-Mar-21 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
It no proof


[27-Mar-21 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
But no*


[27-Mar-21 10:56 PM] ethan;#0003
And then when she was sent the inactive notice thing she is crazy active


[27-Mar-21 10:57 PM] ethan;#0003
Every session


[27-Mar-21 10:57 PM] ethan;#0003
But only trainings


[27-Mar-21 10:57 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk if I’ve ever seen her at an interview


[27-Mar-21 10:57 PM] courtney#5125
i have, shes constantly at my interview sessions


[27-Mar-21 10:58 PM] courtney#5125
i dont really see an issue with the leaking thing. there wasnt any proof to back it up, and if shes being active after being sent the inactive notice then thats what we want; we want her to pick up the activity, thats what the point of the notice is for. nothing wrong with that


[27-Mar-21 10:58 PM] KjRBLX#2053
well ik she can't do the naming thing


[27-Mar-21 10:59 PM] courtney#5125
i agree, thats just unfair to the other managers


[27-Mar-21 10:59 PM] KjRBLX#2053
but we can't really do anything about her getting to sessions early unless shes joining before time put in the announcement


[27-Mar-21 11:00 PM] courtney#5125
idk i always see her arrive at the right time in my servers


[27-Mar-21 11:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Oh wait


[27-Mar-21 11:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"Remember to divide the work evenly with your co-workers."


[27-Mar-21 11:04 PM] KjRBLX#2053
That's better.


[27-Mar-21 11:05 PM] KjRBLX#2053
@ethan; Would you like me to tell her that?


[27-Mar-21 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
Tell her she can’t hog the naming


[27-Mar-21 11:06 PM] ethan;#0003
But in a nicer wording


[27-Mar-21 11:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
hmmm


[27-Mar-21 11:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
"Remember to divide the naming evenly with your co-workers at training sessions."


[27-Mar-21 11:06 PM] KjRBLX#2053
how about that


[27-Mar-21 11:07 PM] ethan;#0003
Divide the naming

tbh i had never seen cheif before


[28-Mar-21 07:42 AM] Polk#1596
until she was a management


[28-Mar-21 07:42 AM] Polk#1596
then she was in my server almost every single session


[28-Mar-21 07:52 AM] katie#0200
same


[28-Mar-21 12:08 PM] cory!#8287
dont know why jacki said that in that tone, he could have taken a more respectful approach


[28-Mar-21 12:35 PM] stacey#1000
If this is how he treats LRs and talks to them I may second guess him for senior vote


[28-Mar-21 12:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
makes the senior vote easier when we have one


[28-Mar-21 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
I vote Tati and Emma


[28-Mar-21 12:55 PM] stacey#1000
Or Addie and Emma


[28-Mar-21 12:56 PM] stacey#1000
But if we can get 3, then those 3


[28-Mar-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
i doubt we'd get 3


[28-Mar-21 12:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
so probs 2


[28-Mar-21 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
I’d probably do Addie and Emma


[28-Mar-21 01:05 PM] stacey#1000
Idk


[28-Mar-21 02:45 PM] Polk#1596

[29-Mar-21 09:44 AM] bonnie591#0591
OMG whenever I got to the dentist I literally cannot survive 10 minutes without eating after


[29-Mar-21 09:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
It's torture, I cannot eat anything for the whole day so my teeth are clean for it, and then I cannot eat after


[29-Mar-21 09:45 AM] KjRBLX#2053
mhm cuz i'd rather them not complain about my teeth being dirty


[29-Mar-21 09:46 AM] KjRBLX#2053

[29-Mar-21 09:46 AM] KjRBLX#2053

[29-Mar-21 09:46 AM] stacey#1000

[29-Mar-21 09:47 AM] stacey#1000
Makes me go there and pay $110 to get a cavity filled just to tell me I have another cavity and have to go back again and spend money again. I left that dentist fast they were out for money

@High Rank I have added some people to promotion opinions again for new possible heads. If you want to promote the ones I have not joined, you can join the card. Please also vote or give opinions on it as well. Same thing as before, make sure you do all background stuff but all seemed clear when I added so, if you want to promote any go claim them!!!


[30-Mar-21 10:16 AM] bonnie591#0591

[30-Mar-21 10:17 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 maybe if these people get promoted we should have enough to look into a senior to shift vote again?


[30-Mar-21 10:17 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yes @bonnie591

Need 1 more vote on 3 of them and then approval as well. If anyone else still wants to promote 1 I can leave 1 and promote 1 just let me know

[31-Mar-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
So of course he’s still leaking.


[31-Mar-21 11:30 AM] stacey#1000
But he’s not leaking major stuff lmao. He’s just saying channel names and thinks he has so much info to leak still. He can’t see anything inside the channels anymore so


[31-Mar-21 11:54 AM] bonnie591#0591
lol literally anyone with betterdiscord can see channel names. wow hes a threat


[31-Mar-21 02:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053

I did


[31-Mar-21 05:08 PM] ethan;#0003

[31-Mar-21 05:08 PM] ethan;#0003

Must of been created in 2019


[31-Mar-21 05:09 PM] ethan;#0003
So then someone I promoted must of copied the document


[31-Mar-21 05:09 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk


[31-Mar-21 05:09 PM] ethan;#0003

[31-Mar-21 05:10 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Oh


[31-Mar-21 05:10 PM] ethan;#0003
Lee wouldn’t ever do that


[31-Mar-21 05:10 PM] ethan;#0003
Or a former mr


[31-Mar-21 05:10 PM] ethan;#0003
It’s too hard to find out who did it


[31-Mar-21 05:10 PM] ethan;#0003
And it’s outdated info


[31-Mar-21 05:11 PM] ethan;#0003
And the mr info isn’t even secretive


[31-Mar-21 05:11 PM] ethan;#0003
