gonna do a short message in management-announcements to notify the managers that they dont need to put identical proof on the card

e.g posting 3 screenshots of the same person advertising at the same time, just with different timezones

also for like offensive username where some puts 6 screenshots of their username on the card

ChampytheALPHA - fired twice in the past as an mr. first one in april 2019 for account sharing. second one october last year for leaking stuff in staff lounge

[01-Aug-21 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
what do you guys think


[01-Aug-21 06:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
keep at lr due to their previous records or let them have another go?


[01-Aug-21 06:54 PM] courtney#5125
ehhh i feel like u dont get to be fired that many times and have another chance at mr


[01-Aug-21 06:55 PM] courtney#5125
we dont even promote many people who resigned to mr a third time, let alone people who were terminated

[01-Aug-21 06:55 PM] courtney#5125

we can do a manager vote


[01-Aug-21 07:57 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, a lot of seniors seem to agree on InternalNFLfan for manager!


[01-Aug-21 07:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes


[01-Aug-21 07:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
the epirori or however u spell it also deserves manager


[01-Aug-21 07:57 PM] courtney#5125
i agree


[01-Aug-21 07:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
also


[01-Aug-21 07:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
aliceqy, although she isnt the most active head she has been mr since like early last year. she goes on inactive notices more than others but thats ok she has a life and shes been really active this summer. id really like to push for her to get manager since shes been head long enough and hasnt really done anything wrong (to my knowledge)


[01-Aug-21 07:59 PM] courtney#5125
right, shed be a good choice too. shes been a head for a while and has been quite active before


[01-Aug-21 08:00 PM] cory!#8287
i can name a lot of heads that would be good managers tbh


[01-Aug-21 08:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
we might be able to hire 4 since we are getting 2 new seniors + we have a lot of heads


[01-Aug-21 08:00 PM] cory!#8287
theres a lot of good ones


[01-Aug-21 08:00 PM] lyss#0709
i agree on alice for sure


[01-Aug-21 08:00 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah theres a lot but id really like to push for alice since shes been here so long


[01-Aug-21 08:01 PM] cory!#8287
yes alice would be good


[01-Aug-21 08:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
feel free to add more nominees since its likely that we'll hire 4! we got 3 good ones right now on the list who will probs get it


[01-Aug-21 08:01 PM] cory!#8287
ive also seen rosehatesfaith a lot and shes an old head


[01-Aug-21 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
oo yea shes good


[01-Aug-21 08:02 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i feel like shes been overlooked in activity, i see her quite a lot


[01-Aug-21 08:02 PM] courtney#5125
she'd make a good choice imo


[01-Aug-21 08:02 PM] bonnie591#0591
feel free to add!


[01-Aug-21 08:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
those 4 seem good choices but we'll see what other nominees we get too!


[01-Aug-21 08:03 PM] courtney#5125
go corie!


[01-Aug-21 08:03 PM] cory!#8287
ok!


[01-Aug-21 08:03 PM] lyss#0709
idk how to feel about rosehatesfaith just bc they arent super respectful in my opinion


[01-Aug-21 08:03 PM] lyss#0709
they are active though ill agree on that


[01-Aug-21 08:05 PM] cory!#8287
ive noticed it too a little but idk

[02-Aug-21 09:53 AM] stacey#1000
What even


[02-Aug-21 10:03 AM] courtney#5125
some things in the fanart channel are starting to get a bit iffy again. things that take like 20 seconds to make shouldnt be posted


[02-Aug-21 10:26 AM] stacey#1000
I think we should maybe announce it again or add it to MR rules or just straight up delete them ourselves


[02-Aug-21 10:28 AM] courtney#5125
i feel like an announcement would be good. if it keeps happening later on after people forget abt the announcement we could add it to mr rules or in the rules to the channel or something


[02-Aug-21 10:29 AM] courtney#5125
its been several months since we last made an announcement addressing it, so i'm sure it just got lost along the way after new mrs got promoted


[02-Aug-21 10:30 AM] bonnie591#0591
announcement seems good


[02-Aug-21 10:31 AM] stacey#1000
Alright anyone can make an announcement. I won‚Äôt be doing it cause I‚Äôm on notice this week on mobile


[02-Aug-21 10:32 AM] courtney#5125
suree i can!


[02-Aug-21 10:40 AM] acelesteq#9395
yes i agree


[02-Aug-21 11:36 AM] courtney#5125
thats not an appropriate conversation topic whatsoever, fatshaming has never been okay :/


[02-Aug-21 11:37 AM] courtney#5125
id honestly push for a warning or suspension


[02-Aug-21 11:37 AM] courtney#5125
sam's not giving herself a good track record


[02-Aug-21 11:37 AM] acelesteq#9395
yep i dont agree with her actions either, fatshaming or anything whatsoever judging is WAY off the line. considering their past issues with other things, im leading towards warning or suspension too


[02-Aug-21 11:42 AM] courtney#5125
@lyss maybe put up a vote! ^

if how many days, maybe 3-4 days


[02-Aug-21 11:56 AM] acelesteq#9395
leading more 3 since it isnt that much


[02-Aug-21 11:56 AM] courtney#5125
^ imo 3 would be the better option


[02-Aug-21 12:00 PM] drizzle#4256
yeah i also think 3 days


[02-Aug-21 12:00 PM] stacey#1000
This is her second suspension


[02-Aug-21 12:16 PM] lyss#0709
alright, thoughts??

Greetings Samvolleykoala35,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as Management at Bloxton Hotels as of August 2nd at xx:xx PM CST. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to having inappropriate conversation topics and body shaming in MR Lounge. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude at August 5th at xx:xx PM CST, and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

floweursfrom1970
Shift Manager
Bloxton Hotels

[02-Aug-21 12:22 PM] cory!#8287
hopefully she won‚Äôt treat this suspension like a joke

[02-Aug-21 12:27 PM] acelesteq#9395

she'll never learn that way


[02-Aug-21 01:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
her next suspension is an automatic demotion so


[02-Aug-21 01:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
shes on her way to that if thats what she thinks

@bonnie591 do u think canary can be un-rank locked because ive seen massive improvements from her


[02-Aug-21 06:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
mhm!


[02-Aug-21 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
un rank locked, you may add to the manager vote if you wish for her to get manager this time around


[02-Aug-21 06:25 PM] cory!#8287
yay ok


[02-Aug-21 06:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
idk if id vote for her this time or next time tho it would depend


[02-Aug-21 06:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
@lyss have you got any photos of rose being disrespectful or whatever. it'll help my decision!


[02-Aug-21 06:26 PM] cory!#8287
id probably vote for her over rose because ive seen her a lot more than rose


[02-Aug-21 06:27 PM] cory!#8287
and she helps out heads a lot in mr discussion


[02-Aug-21 06:27 PM] cory!#8287
idk about her maturity in-game since i dont see her often in-game but from looking at discord i think shes improved


[02-Aug-21 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
ANYWAY if canary did get promoted then I CALL DIBS because she always asks me to invite her to promos i do since she wants to see them and help out with them. SO I WANT TO INVITE HER TO HER OWN PROMO


[02-Aug-21 06:27 PM] cory!#8287
omg thats a smart idea


[02-Aug-21 06:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
yes!!


[02-Aug-21 06:28 PM] courtney#5125
yeah ive seen a lot of improvements from canary lately, itd be nice to see her get management soon!


[02-Aug-21 06:28 PM] courtney#5125
i see her in-game quite a bit and i personally dont see any issues with her maturity


[02-Aug-21 06:28 PM] cory!#8287
ooo ok!


[02-Aug-21 06:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
its a shame we are 4 away from max managers (if seniors r promoted) since i would allow 5 to be hired but hmm


[02-Aug-21 06:32 PM] cory!#8287
yeah rip


[02-Aug-21 06:36 PM] lyss#0709
its really not super solid proof and honestly it could be subjective, but in my opinion rose just kind of acts like theyre superior to others and is really short with people especially in mr-discussion if you want to look there


[02-Aug-21 06:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
well im done

i dont think they should be held back from manager forever but theres other candidates in the management vote that are just more personable and kind to others that would deserve a promotion more right now


[02-Aug-21 06:37 PM] lyss#0709
yeah thats the biggest thing for me, it was a weird and oddly hostile interaction to have


[02-Aug-21 06:38 PM] bonnie591#0591
hm okay how about this


[02-Aug-21 06:39 PM] courtney#5125
ya that image sorta makes me re-think how i feel about voting for them to get manager


[02-Aug-21 06:40 PM] cory!#8287
god damn


[02-Aug-21 06:40 PM] cory!#8287
i didnt know she was like that


[02-Aug-21 06:40 PM] cory!#8287
she gave off negative vibes imo but i didnt think she was rude like that


[02-Aug-21 06:40 PM] bonnie591#0591
i think we should probably just monitor it. i dont think she should be held back from it forever like lyss said, but we should probably consider her during the next vote instead


[02-Aug-21 06:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
sound good?


[02-Aug-21 06:41 PM] bonnie591#0591
this is if internal, canary, alice and epi win


[02-Aug-21 06:41 PM] cory!#8287
yes i agree with that


[02-Aug-21 06:41 PM] courtney#5125
i agree as well, those 4 would make rlly good managers this time around anyways


[02-Aug-21 08:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@bonnie591 how many votes for manager voting

the only people i saw participating was kyle, cj, and a2va, the others are already banned from the server


[03-Aug-21 11:14 AM] cory!#8287
abt jedi and billy i have mixed opinions abt their situation cuz i dont think they were super involved but i they shouldnt have commented on that tik tok


[03-Aug-21 11:25 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve already banned and blacklisted people before for harassing mansion. Everyone that was doing the same thing should get the same consequences. Every single person that was in that group chat and taking part in get, blacklist them and ban them from the discord no exceptions ever for this. The 2 MRs that were not in the group chat but still commented on the video should be warned or suspended.  Please blacklist all the users that were in the group chat taking part in it @acelesteq

Um you could say that her bans unappealable cuz it does say that on the discord, also liz sent me a screenshot of a group chat called ‚Äú2 Alts‚Äù or something like that one time but she deleted it really quickly so I don‚Äôt really remember much of the details but ye√§h

She might bring up that Liz was able to appeal but then you can just say it‚Äôs  a case by case basis and it was a group decision @courtney

[04-Aug-21 04:30 PM] ethan;#0003

i dont think we shouldd but if we do then we should have a rule that you can only do it in certain channels aka dont do it in reports or verify (unless theres a setting to turn it off in certain channels)

in some servers ive been in they think mods and admins cant see the thread

Nvm no I don‚Äôt but


[05-Aug-21 05:16 AM] Tattoblue#5828
I think maybe we should ask Maya some questions and see what she says


[05-Aug-21 05:16 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Idk


[05-Aug-21 05:16 AM] Tattoblue#5828

[05-Aug-21 05:16 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yea


[05-Aug-21 05:17 AM] stacey#1000
I can talk to maya


[05-Aug-21 05:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
I doubt jaiden would have made that up anyway so I believe it without proof


[05-Aug-21 05:17 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôm in a gc with her and Kyle


[05-Aug-21 05:17 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yea please do


[05-Aug-21 05:17 AM] Tattoblue#5828
But that‚Äôs yikes cuz he reported Benson for doing similar things like a year ago or whenever benson was an MR


[05-Aug-21 05:17 AM] Tattoblue#5828
And we were nearly about to promote benson to senior

"I think some shift managers should resign so senior managers have a chance" sounds a little bit like he wants shift manager üíÄ


[05-Aug-21 09:53 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 Kyle and maya reported to me that they thought JJ Was overworking himself but it wasn‚Äôt really trash talking him.  For some reason this message didn‚Äôt send earlier.


[05-Aug-21 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
Actually it was Maya that told me that Kyle was talking about it and was concerned over him overworking himself thinking he had to do every session or something idk


[05-Aug-21 10:08 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey did u ask her about the resignation thingy that he supposedly said


[05-Aug-21 10:14 AM] stacey#1000
I told her I want to talk to her about a report that she was there as a witness and that I need Info from her but she‚Äôs not online yet. She‚Äôs probably still sleeping.


[05-Aug-21 11:09 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Whew lord


[05-Aug-21 11:39 AM] stacey#1000
Eek I‚Äôm very concerned having Kyle as a senior now after talking to maya. I‚Äôll announce shortly still talking to her


[05-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Oop


[05-Aug-21 12:16 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[05-Aug-21 12:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well whatever consequence we give him I want a rank lock for him

{Reactions}
‚è´ 

[05-Aug-21 12:19 PM] stacey#1000
I think he should be warned or suspended. This can not be something we should ignore and just rank lock.


[05-Aug-21 12:19 PM] cory!#8287
i dont understand why some seniors are mad abt the recent shift promotions like..


[05-Aug-21 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
He legit acted so fake towards Jj.

There's no point having someone who probabaly trash talks most of us anyway. Our hr team is perfect right now and I don't want it ruined


[05-Aug-21 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
Like bruh ‚Äúwhat are your opinions on JJ‚Äù‚Äù the second JJ leaves the vc.


[05-Aug-21 12:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
I vote suspend


[05-Aug-21 12:20 PM] stacey#1000
Let me add vote.


[05-Aug-21 12:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Btw guys


[05-Aug-21 12:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yikes, that‚Äôs upsetting to see coming from Kyle


[05-Aug-21 12:21 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
As being close friend of Kyle‚Äôs, I would have never thought he would be the one to act like that


[05-Aug-21 12:21 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I told maya I was honestly shocked. She told me he‚Äôs changed a lot.


[05-Aug-21 12:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
Since madi has improved would u guys be up for potentially allowing her to become hr next time. The schedule does need aussie trainings and she would be a good addition to the hr team yk. Also been senior for 2+ years


[05-Aug-21 12:21 PM] stacey#1000
Yes


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
But let‚Äôs talk about that another time


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] cory!#8287
i wouldnt mind tbh


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] stacey#1000
Rn we talking about kyles consequences


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] cory!#8287
but i think kyle should get


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] cory!#8287
consequences


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yes OK!


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah let‚Äôs focus on this rn


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I agree with a suspension


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
Caps


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Same


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
How long


[05-Aug-21 12:22 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Did we suspend someone recently for making rude comments about their fellow co workers?


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] cory!#8287
i have noticed kyle change a little but didnt think much abt it


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Trash talking used to be a very serious offence


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
So yes i think a suspension is good


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
So perhaps


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
4+ days


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] stacey#1000
I won‚Äôt be suspending him becuase he won‚Äôt take it seriously from me


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] cory!#8287
^


[05-Aug-21 12:23 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I would like to do it.


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] stacey#1000
He doesn‚Äôt take me seriously as an HR


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yas the revenge kj


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] stacey#1000
Idk why


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Kj did you put warning by accident?


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
I can help if u want


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] stacey#1000
Ok he‚Äôs good to get suspended


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] KjRBLX#2053
You saw nothing.


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Can we do


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
4 daysss


[05-Aug-21 12:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Or 5


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
Also. Just note maya wanted to remain anon so you can‚Äôt send him any proof from what I sent


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôd say 4 days is good


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
4 days is good


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes 4 days


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] cory!#8287
ya 4 seems good


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
I don't really think 3 is enough for this offence


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Let me power on my computer üñ•


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
He‚Äôs a senior and should‚Äôve known better especially when this is his second time as a senior


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] bonnie591#0591
Has Kyle had any warnings or suspensions before in the past


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
So 4 days is good


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
No


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] stacey#1000
But this is his second time as a senior


[05-Aug-21 12:25 PM] cory!#8287
i dont think


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
I‚Äôm still pretty shocked that Kyle would be the one to do something like this. Especially yeah this being his 2nd time as a Senior


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
hes been senior before??


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] bonnie591#0591
oh


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
He resigned in 2019


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] stacey#1000
Another thing to note


[05-Aug-21 12:26 PM] cory!#8287
fr tho


[05-Aug-21 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
Is when I was in vc with maya she said Kyle acts complete differently in vcs with HRs and is different with MRs. Cause I vc with him and maya a few times and he never mentioned anything like this


[05-Aug-21 12:27 PM] bonnie591#0591
ima check his past users quickly


[05-Aug-21 12:27 PM] stacey#1000
He thinks if he doesn‚Äôt say it around HRs in vc that he‚Äôs safe.


[05-Aug-21 12:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
when hes making imag look good üò≥


[05-Aug-21 12:28 PM] cory!#8287
i just hope he doesnt catch on that maya or jaiden reported him even without the proof


[05-Aug-21 12:28 PM] cory!#8287
LOL


[05-Aug-21 12:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
theres no physical proof but jaiden and maya arent gonna just make that up for no reason so yea we'll just say its classified


[05-Aug-21 12:29 PM] cory!#8287
OH ya right


[05-Aug-21 12:30 PM] stacey#1000
I just realized that kyle tried reporting imag to me before for going afk at a shift and it was nothing


[05-Aug-21 12:33 PM] stacey#1000
Omg I also just realized that Kyle got jaiden suspended when he was suspended before since he‚Äôs the one that reported it. Now jaiden is doing the same thing for Kyle how ironic


[05-Aug-21 12:33 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Greetings **kylusions**,

I'm writing to you to inform you that you've been suspended from your position as **12 | Senior Management** from Bloxton Hotels as of **8/5/2021 12:XX PM CST**. The reasoning behind your suspension is due to **trash-talking about fellow employees of Blox-ton Hotels**. As you should know, Bloxton Hotels has high standards for our Middle-Ranks and due to your actions committed, we unfortunately feel it necessary to issue a suspension which puts a temporary hold on your duties. Your suspension is due to conclude at **8/9/2021 12:XX PM CST** and which then you may return to your duties. If you have any questions or concerns, please reply to this letter accordingly. Thank you.

Signed,

**KjRBLX**
**Shift Manager**

There is always someone upset over a promotion.  It happens for every single promo


[05-Aug-21 01:02 PM] cory!#8287

[05-Aug-21 01:03 PM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Aug-21 01:03 PM] bonnie591#0591

[05-Aug-21 02:01 PM] lyss#0709
i'm pretty sure kyle has some anxiety with co hosting of some sorts, he's mentioned not really liking it before because it's stressful. that's not the best way to deal with it but i wouldn't hold it against him.


[05-Aug-21 02:20 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Hes asked me a few times if he could co host and hes cohosted with JJ b4 so


[05-Aug-21 02:25 PM] lyss#0709
i don't really think that means that it isn't stressful


[05-Aug-21 02:27 PM] Tattoblue#5828
ya but even if it is stressful for him like he doesnt have to tell maya to not let JJ cohost he couldve said it better obvi he doesnt have to let people cohost if he doesnt want to but in those screenshots he was rude ab it


[05-Aug-21 02:30 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
You know the thing with Kyle though is he is a very sarcastic person. There‚Äôs time where I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs actually being serious so I don‚Äôt take it seriously. Maya and Kyle seem to be pretty close, so idk those screenshots kinda give me that vibe but of course like Lyss said he could of handled it better.


[05-Aug-21 02:31 PM] KjRBLX#2053

[05-Aug-21 02:34 PM] KjRBLX#2053
He wants proof too, so ill just add in i cant provide proof either?

[05-Aug-21 02:35 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
honestly I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt catch it unless he already did but just wants to make sure


[05-Aug-21 02:35 PM] KjRBLX#2053
To keep the individuals anonymous, I can‚Äôt provide you proof or an exact time-frame but it was recent.

I just got out of school but I peeked in earlier to see


[05-Aug-21 03:22 PM] stacey#1000
Maya is really worried he‚Äôs going to find out she reported him too and I had to explain to her she is anon to protect her and no hr would share it cause it‚Äôs confidential from the report


[05-Aug-21 03:23 PM] stacey#1000
I just hope Kyle learns from this but it is what it is.


[05-Aug-21 03:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
kyles chances of hr are just gone


[05-Aug-21 03:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
he can learn from it


[05-Aug-21 03:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
but unlikely he'll move up


[05-Aug-21 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
Yeahhh. He doesn‚Äôt seem to be learning from his suspension so far

I guess doxxing and cyberbullying someone is a false ban

Oop


[06-Aug-21 06:41 PM] courtney#5125
at most maybe a warning for just speaking appropriately in mr channels, but i feel like a lot of the things alex brought up rlly arent that bad. obviously cursing at people and excluding them isnt ok, however that doesnt seem like what libby is doing. having a conversation with just one other person is fine as long as youre not explicitly telling people they cant join in the convo. a lot of what libby said is probs all in good fun considering it seems like she has a lot of friends on the mr team that she jokes around with


[06-Aug-21 06:41 PM] lyss#0709
i really dont think any of that is worthy of a consequence, maybe something to keep an eye on but thats it


[06-Aug-21 06:42 PM] lyss#0709
it really doesnt seem like shes excluding anyone, theres a difference between talking to someone directly and excluding ppl


[06-Aug-21 06:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
right no, all of that is just jokes between her friends


[06-Aug-21 06:42 PM] anna#0004
that first one about the gc is bc imag was trying to be added to a gc that has me, libby, jude, lee, lil, polk and min in it so that imag can ss things and send it into sl to "expose" us, imag always begs us to be added into it for that reason so we always tell her like theres no need for us to add her


[06-Aug-21 06:42 PM] lyss#0709
as for the swearing, we cant just punish libby for that bc shes not the only one who swears at her friends; imo thats not even a huge deal unless the people its directed at say it upsets them


[06-Aug-21 06:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
no consequences are to be applied


[06-Aug-21 06:43 PM] anna#0004
the swearing stuff wasnt bad either, she didnt use that in a rude way


[06-Aug-21 06:43 PM] courtney#5125
i think alex just took those things a little too personally


[06-Aug-21 06:43 PM] Tattoblue#5828
I don‚Äôt think any consequences should be given, also Alex or Sam have mentioned like group chats and have told people to look at whatever group chat and stuff and we never punished her  them for that so


[06-Aug-21 06:43 PM] courtney#5125
very hypocritical of alex to report libby in my opinion


[06-Aug-21 06:43 PM] anna#0004
and then everything else was just jokes towards friends, i dont think any of that proof was bad at all, im not saying that bc im libbys friend but none of that proof is valid for a consequence at all its just her joking around, alex probably has something against her or smething idk


[06-Aug-21 06:44 PM] bonnie591#0591
the swearing things were obviously stuff between friends and stuff, plus swearing is allowed in mr lounge so


[06-Aug-21 06:44 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I don‚Äôt think any consequences should be given either I just told her I would discuss it with the HR team


[06-Aug-21 06:44 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Mhm mhm


[06-Aug-21 06:44 PM] lyss#0709
yeah alex just seems to be taking most of those messages out of context and making them into a bigger deal than they are. its never been a rule that u cant joke with ur friends unless theyre clearly not ok with it


[06-Aug-21 06:44 PM] courtney#5125
yeah, if we were to warn people for joking around with their friends, no one would even want to talk in sl anymore


[06-Aug-21 06:44 PM] anna#0004
also i dont see how her saying "ANNA HE WAS SUS" was bad either bc she was talking ab her brother irl LOL


[06-Aug-21 06:45 PM] courtney#5125
having a conversation with someone in a public channel isnt against the rules.... we dont require people to "talk in private" if what they say doesnt involve everybody lmaoo


[06-Aug-21 06:45 PM] lyss#0709
right its not excluding anyone, its just having a direct conversation with someone


[06-Aug-21 06:45 PM] stacey#1000
Right


[06-Aug-21 06:45 PM] stacey#1000

[06-Aug-21 06:46 PM] cory!#8287
seems like jokes to me so i dont think anything should be done


[06-Aug-21 06:46 PM] lyss#0709

yeah I had no clue what I was looking at rn when reviewing the screenshots. I wasn‚Äôt sure what Libby was saying had anything to do with what Alex was reporting her for


[06-Aug-21 06:47 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i wouldve never thought anything was wrong if i were to be glancing through sl


[06-Aug-21 06:47 PM] stacey#1000
I joke around with my friends like that all the time. Like saying ‚Äúblaire you are a noob and you suck‚Äù but then they say the same thing to me. It‚Äôs joking around.

if anything i see more things coming from the twins rather than libby herself @stacey


[06-Aug-21 07:29 PM] acelesteq#9395
libby jokes around here and there but nothing i see there is really something that would "leave out" anyone, of course its not ok to mention something gc wise but if anything, it happens from alex too


[06-Aug-21 07:29 PM] acelesteq#9395

Both have been suspended for exclusion and being rude towards other mrs so uh...

@cory! did mansion report stuff to you as well about being cyberbullied


[08-Aug-21 03:00 PM] stacey#1000
from the server you are in that you mentioned before cause he reported it to me as well


[08-Aug-21 03:06 PM] stacey#1000
only reason I joined this server is to see the drama in it to blacklist people if enough evidence


[08-Aug-21 03:12 PM] cory!#8287
no someone in the server reported that people were cyberbullying mamajo not mansion


[08-Aug-21 03:21 PM] stacey#1000
alright ill announce what was reported


[08-Aug-21 03:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
@stacey honestly those in the VC that aren‚Äôt banned, should get banned or so because some who were muted where texting in the chat. The other thing that I‚Äôm concerned about is that some current MRs are in that same server and they have mod/admin to ban people or so on


[08-Aug-21 03:39 PM] acelesteq#9395
Instead nothing is being done about it and rules within that server don‚Äôt seem to be in place


[08-Aug-21 03:39 PM] acelesteq#9395
Which makes me wonder if they allow those types of things to happen or they aren‚Äôt aware


[08-Aug-21 03:40 PM] stacey#1000
true


[08-Aug-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
I joined it yesterday to see it for myself


[08-Aug-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
and then more HRs and MRs joined and got free ranked


[08-Aug-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
ehhh.....

seee what i mean


[08-Aug-21 03:41 PM] stacey#1000
mansion wants to know if we can get it deleted but idk if we could do that


[08-Aug-21 03:42 PM] stacey#1000
@emily @drizzle thoughts on this server since you joined it as well


[08-Aug-21 03:43 PM] acelesteq#9395
Yeah but it‚Äôs like why stick around in a server where it‚Äôs crazy and causing problems


[08-Aug-21 03:43 PM] stacey#1000
im only in it to see the drama to get more evidence but i havent witness anyone attacking mansion so far


[08-Aug-21 03:43 PM] acelesteq#9395
Like idk that‚Äôs just me on the current MRs joining and have access to see that. Let alone none of them reported it to us


[08-Aug-21 03:43 PM] acelesteq#9395
Yeah


[08-Aug-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
do you want to join it to help me get evidence


[08-Aug-21 03:44 PM] stacey#1000
if u want


[08-Aug-21 03:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
Personally, the server holds a lot of blacklisted users as shown in the VC video but I think I may be possible to get it deleted if we ask Mama or whoever made it to try and comply with us since it‚Äôs causing issues


[08-Aug-21 03:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
And yeah sure I can


[08-Aug-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
I think it should get deleted


[08-Aug-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
and its also turning into like a whole other bh server which it shouldnt


[08-Aug-21 03:45 PM] stacey#1000
with how hes changing the name of the ranks

https://discord.gg/3HMyAXZY


[08-Aug-21 03:46 PM] stacey#1000
if anyone wants to join to help me just observe it and gather more information to see if we can enforce the owner to just delete it feel free


[08-Aug-21 03:49 PM] ethan;#0003
mamajo üò≠


[08-Aug-21 03:49 PM] ethan;#0003
not that kid


[08-Aug-21 03:49 PM] ethan;#0003
isnt that the one who was hitting on emily


[08-Aug-21 03:49 PM] drizzle#4256
i‚Äôve noticed that it does seem to be causing a lot of problems and yeah i agree with trying to get the server deleted if possible


[08-Aug-21 03:49 PM] stacey#1000
this server is basically turning into a blacklisted people hangout


[08-Aug-21 03:51 PM] acelesteq#9395
something that doesnt fit right with me is that the co-owners are the ones who talk there too

[08-Aug-21 03:53 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq how do you get discord ID of people that were in vc in the server


[08-Aug-21 03:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
like their discord tag?


[08-Aug-21 03:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
not discord tag


[08-Aug-21 03:53 PM] acelesteq#9395

[08-Aug-21 03:53 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Aug-21 03:53 PM] acelesteq#9395

np!


[08-Aug-21 03:59 PM] acelesteq#9395
there's not really much i can find within the server that is cyberbullying but 100% believe someone should attempt to reach out to mamajo about it in order to get deleted


[08-Aug-21 04:00 PM] acelesteq#9395
also possibly if needed, maybe another announcement regarding servers like that which withhold a lot of drama or unnecessary behavior within those outside the MR Team


[08-Aug-21 04:00 PM] acelesteq#9395
in general, i dislike any fan servers or friend servers or whatever server that has half the MR team and random community/LRs


[08-Aug-21 04:01 PM] acelesteq#9395
its legit a problem awaiting to happen


[08-Aug-21 04:03 PM] acelesteq#9395
like for example these rules

"that would lead to a ban at Bloxton too" like he has the power to ban people when legit all he would do is report it to one of us then it **COMES** into bloxton which is a perfect example of how things like this arise

[08-Aug-21 04:04 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Aug-21 04:05 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Aug-21 04:05 PM] acelesteq#9395

[08-Aug-21 04:05 PM] stacey#1000

[08-Aug-21 04:05 PM] stacey#1000

[09-Aug-21 03:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe a verbal or written warning for jaiden


[09-Aug-21 03:07 PM] lyss#0709
"but since you're a new manager i take precautions for learning curves" why does he think that's his responsibility? she's clearly uncomfortable with it and he keeps harassing her. that's weird


[09-Aug-21 03:07 PM] acelesteq#9395
Personally I think he‚Äôs trying to prevent anything from occurring to her since he got suspended over stuff, he‚Äôs just trying to look out for a fellow co-worker


[09-Aug-21 03:08 PM] acelesteq#9395
Eh I don‚Äôt really see it as a written warning cause he‚Äôs trying to look out for her since she‚Äôs a new manager and giving advice on a sort of way. That‚Äôs how I see it and I see how it could be taking as ‚Äúharassment/uncomfortable ‚Äú


[09-Aug-21 03:09 PM] lyss#0709
yeah but if she's asked him to stop then he should. i don't really think it's his job to do that anyways unless she actually asks him for help with something


[09-Aug-21 03:09 PM] acelesteq#9395
Yeah sort of weird


[09-Aug-21 03:09 PM] lyss#0709
the idea is nice but if he's told to back off then he should


[09-Aug-21 03:10 PM] acelesteq#9395
I mean either way he could be thinking it‚Äôs okay that‚Äôs why he continued


[09-Aug-21 03:10 PM] acelesteq#9395
Like I said, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs written warning but verbal warning is fine too. That‚Äôs just how it came out to me when reading, maybe when he gets whichever warning, he‚Äôll understand


[09-Aug-21 03:12 PM] Fraux#7971
hello


[09-Aug-21 03:12 PM] lyss#0709
yeah he could potentially think like that she's not serious about it or something


[09-Aug-21 03:12 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hmm, I‚Äôd say probably a reminder to Jaiden to stay in his lane and not go after newer MRs like he did with canary cause it his not his job to be critiquing every little thing they do. if anything that stresses an MR out rather than help especially since she asked him to stop


[09-Aug-21 03:12 PM] lyss#0709
it's not fair for her to feel uncomfortable even though it's not a huge deal


[09-Aug-21 03:12 PM] acelesteq#9395

[09-Aug-21 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
Jaiden shouldn‚Äôt be doing that to canary....she hasn‚Äôt even been a manager for a week. If that were me I‚Äôd feel very overwhelmed and stressed to make a mistake even more. That‚Äôs not right at all.


[09-Aug-21 03:38 PM] stacey#1000
Aww fraux :((


[09-Aug-21 03:56 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq @xM_inn @Polk so I‚Äôm quitting scso in 2 days and maya is talking to me about applying to dhs and how she might be. Is it worth it and should I as well?


[09-Aug-21 04:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yikes thats jaidens like 2nd warning or something üò¨


[09-Aug-21 04:09 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey yes u shud apply imma apply as well!


[09-Aug-21 04:10 PM] acelesteq#9395
it‚Äôs worth it. Dhs opens a lot of opportunities not just one like scso/swat but to CRT, SS, or normal


[09-Aug-21 04:10 PM] acelesteq#9395
apply, I highly recommend it


[09-Aug-21 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
Yeah it's definitely worth it


[09-Aug-21 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
Tons of experience and opportunities


[09-Aug-21 04:13 PM] xM_inn#2821
And you'll have us plus Lee who is also in DHS along with anyone else from FS u know!


[09-Aug-21 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
I mean I don‚Äôt expect to get in but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try I suppose. I‚Äôm quitting scso already anyways I asked to leave Wednesday. Scso just got boring.


[09-Aug-21 04:15 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq @xM_inn can you look through my friends list to see if I need to unfriend anyone idk if any of them are like known criminals


[09-Aug-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôve already unfriended quite a bit of people recently to get it below 100


[09-Aug-21 04:16 PM] stacey#1000
And don‚Äôt question my avatar rn I got bored LOL


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
well uh since this chat is classified and i asked before to the former sec


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
turns out you dont need to unfriend anyone with a record


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
if they arent major crims


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
Oh


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm friends with any major crime


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
if they come on daily


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
like


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
to do crims and stuff


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
and are well known


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] acelesteq#9395
those are the crims they are talking about


[09-Aug-21 04:18 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah I‚Äôm good then


[09-Aug-21 04:19 PM] acelesteq#9395
otherwise if someone has one or three


[09-Aug-21 04:19 PM] acelesteq#9395
you're fine


[09-Aug-21 04:19 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll try applying since I‚Äôm quitting scso anyways but if I don‚Äôt get in idc


[09-Aug-21 04:19 PM] acelesteq#9395

DHS is a big upgrade from SCSO/FSP


[09-Aug-21 04:20 PM] Polk#1596
Highly recommended


[09-Aug-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll try applying only cause I‚Äôm quitting scso


[09-Aug-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
I should be done scso wed


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
FPS - glorified deputy w/ dog
SS - unique 
CRT - swat but cooler looking


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
Yes


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
I quit FSP before I submitted my DHS app


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
FSP just really wasn't doing it for me


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
Not that I was confident in passing


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
I just hated FSP


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] stacey#1000
Scso has just been so boring for me for awhile now


[09-Aug-21 04:21 PM] Polk#1596
I don't blame you


[09-Aug-21 04:22 PM] Polk#1596
DHS is a whole different experience worth trying thouhh


[09-Aug-21 04:22 PM] Polk#1596
though**


[09-Aug-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
I don‚Äôt really care if I don‚Äôt get in I‚Äôll just apply cause it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try


[09-Aug-21 04:22 PM] stacey#1000
Ik it‚Äôs harder to even get into it


[09-Aug-21 04:22 PM] Polk#1596
Worth a shot


[09-Aug-21 04:23 PM] Polk#1596
I got in with DOC sgt + MD ensign and 7 months in FSP

[09-Aug-21 07:06 PM] lyss#0709
i mean furries arent dogs theyre still people but i feel like its similar to trying to say "you're gay" as an insult. so it's not really discriminatory in my opinion


[09-Aug-21 07:07 PM] lyss#0709
its just someone trying to be rude and disrespect people


[09-Aug-21 07:07 PM] lyss#0709
but not quite discrimination


[09-Aug-21 07:07 PM] courtney#5125
i would disagree that its discrimination

We can put "Staff blacklist" on their in-game ban reason, right?


[10-Aug-21 04:00 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I put it on there already, but I'm just double checking.


[10-Aug-21 04:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya u do


[10-Aug-21 04:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Can we acc stop themed sessions since it has caused drama almost every time during the recent ones


[10-Aug-21 04:01 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Staff blacklist filled out. ‚úçÔ∏è


[10-Aug-21 04:01 PM] stacey#1000
Yeah that‚Äôs why I stopped hosting them for now


[10-Aug-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
But the way they had to attack me over one when it wasn‚Äôt even my session....shows they don‚Äôt deserve theme sessions.


[10-Aug-21 04:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ty sir

i dont even see the petition online..


[10-Aug-21 04:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
honestly I stopped hosting themed sessions long time ago 1. Because they‚Äôre stressful having to have everything built by a certain time and 2. People always complaining about not getting in


[10-Aug-21 04:18 PM] cory!#8287
i literally dont understand why staceys getting harassed for a theme session i planned like it makes no sense


[10-Aug-21 04:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
Themed sessions are fun


[10-Aug-21 04:19 PM] acelesteq#9395
right


[10-Aug-21 04:19 PM] acelesteq#9395
but people are just so rude and childish because they don‚Äôt get in


[10-Aug-21 04:19 PM] bonnie591#0591
But its just getting ruined now and  it's time consuming to build especially if ur server crashes


[10-Aug-21 04:19 PM] acelesteq#9395
Last time I hosted my themed session (for sure first and last one), I got told I was a bad host for delaying it even though the server got shutdown


[10-Aug-21 04:20 PM] bonnie591#0591
Its probs time to stop themed sessions. Maybe some can be allowed such as a final session as hr themed session maybe


[10-Aug-21 04:20 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i wont host them anymore after this one


[10-Aug-21 04:24 PM] stacey#1000
Yep it‚Äôs def not worth it anymore


[10-Aug-21 04:25 PM] lyss#0709
agreed that's so uncalled for


[10-Aug-21 06:29 PM] ethan;#0003
themed sessions used to be like a once an every few month occurance


[10-Aug-21 06:29 PM] ethan;#0003
now its like weekly


[10-Aug-21 06:29 PM] ethan;#0003
like for a holity


[10-Aug-21 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
like halloween


[10-Aug-21 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
or 4th of july


[10-Aug-21 06:30 PM] ethan;#0003
or bloxton annaversery


[10-Aug-21 09:30 PM] courtney#5125

What


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] acelesteq#9395
^ legit me rn too


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Whoever reported that is just after vac


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
For some reason


[11-Aug-21 08:34 PM] ethan;#0003
Or just a snowflake


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] acelesteq#9395
tbh i dont think it should be taken personal or so, ive seen **MANY** mrs make fun of tiktokers and still they don't get in trouble for it, why should vac get in trouble for someone who is PUBLIC and ONLINE on an app.


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] ethan;#0003
@xM_inn who is Matt


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] acelesteq#9395
its legit life, nobody is perfect and mostly there's always going to be people hating on famous people


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] courtney#5125
yeah i mean making fun of people isnt cool but this rlly isnt that big of a deal


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] xM_inn#2821
mattiworldd or something like that, they're a Management


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] acelesteq#9395
its not a big idea **UNLESS** its someone in real life or someone they know


[11-Aug-21 08:35 PM] acelesteq#9395
yk


[11-Aug-21 08:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
its not a personal attack unless the tiktoker themselves say it is


[11-Aug-21 08:36 PM] courtney#5125
i completely understood punishing people for fatshaming people like lizzo, but this is just a very minor comment in my opinion


[11-Aug-21 08:36 PM] courtney#5125
well i dont think thats quite the case, its still not okay to say bad things about people, but this was just a single minor comment


[11-Aug-21 08:36 PM] courtney#5125
its not ok whether you know them personally or not


[11-Aug-21 08:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah but its a tiktoker


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
if anything ive witnessed MRs from the past do the same about other tiktokers or famous people


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
and they never got any type of reminder nor warning for it


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] courtney#5125
its still unnecessary to say bad things abt someone, tiktoker, celebrity, whomever. theyre people


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] courtney#5125
but i dont think we should punish vac for it, its a super small thing


[11-Aug-21 08:37 PM] courtney#5125
in this case, anyhow


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] courtney#5125
its too minor


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] ethan;#0003
Idk why Matt would even report that


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
i get its unnecessary but being reported for that is so weird


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
like its a tiktoker??


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] ethan;#0003
It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs after vac cus of how professionally he wrote the report


[11-Aug-21 08:38 PM] ethan;#0003
Just read the end of the report in the second image


[11-Aug-21 08:39 PM] ethan;#0003
Seems like he is after vac or has something against him


[11-Aug-21 08:39 PM] courtney#5125
i feel like the argument that "its a tiktoker" is kind of irrelevant, considering its still a person. either way though, matt probably just took it a little too far when reporting it. vac didnt say anything super major, it was one comment


[11-Aug-21 08:39 PM] courtney#5125
i agree, the way he worded it is weird


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] acelesteq#9395
vac reported him before for going afk during a session without telling him


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] courtney#5125
all the more reason we shouldnt punish vac, it seems like a biased report


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] cory!#8287
^


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] acelesteq#9395
i agree


[11-Aug-21 08:40 PM] ethan;#0003
People shit talk celebrities all the time, nothing wrong with it they are just haters and haters are gonna hate


[11-Aug-21 08:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
mhm


[11-Aug-21 08:42 PM] ethan;#0003
Was matti formally warned for it?


[11-Aug-21 08:42 PM] acelesteq#9395
let me find it

thats the link to where it is


[11-Aug-21 08:43 PM] ethan;#0003
Was he informed of the warning


[11-Aug-21 08:43 PM] ethan;#0003
If so@it‚Äôs probs spite


[11-Aug-21 08:43 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah


[11-Aug-21 08:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
he was


[11-Aug-21 08:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
but like it was a month ago


[11-Aug-21 08:44 PM] acelesteq#9395
so like idk, i dont wanna assume anything yet unless theres more proof yk


[11-Aug-21 08:46 PM] ethan;#0003
Recently people on the internet have gotten so sensitive  about every little thing it‚Äôs crazy I see it everywhere


[11-Aug-21 08:48 PM] acelesteq#9395
covid (as in like people staying more time at home) been crazy like not only people getting sensitive but also other stuff like people having more free time on their hands to do stuff like posting hate online, getting a disney ride taken down, getting a syrup brand to take away their logo, much more really


[11-Aug-21 08:49 PM] acelesteq#9395
basically people doing their research including trying to "cancel" people


[11-Aug-21 08:57 PM] stacey#1000
Wasn‚Äôt there concern before that Matt could be an alt acc of a blacklisted user but we never got like real evidence of it but was just suspicious of it


[11-Aug-21 08:58 PM] stacey#1000
This report seems really not needed


[11-Aug-21 08:58 PM] stacey#1000
Like a report to get someone in trouble for something so minor


[11-Aug-21 09:11 PM] ethan;#0003
Tatto and I did an investigation


[11-Aug-21 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
We are like 75% sure that he knew Eddie was an alt


[11-Aug-21 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
Or where pretty sure


[11-Aug-21 09:12 PM] ethan;#0003
But we found nothing


[11-Aug-21 09:13 PM] ethan;#0003
I‚Äôm pretty sure we where drawn between investigating matti and Eddie and we did matti cus we didn‚Äôt think Eddie was an alt


[11-Aug-21 09:13 PM] ethan;#0003
How wrong we where üò≠


[11-Aug-21 09:18 PM] stacey#1000
Eddie still got himself fired anyways sooner or later people‚Äôs true colours show.


[11-Aug-21 09:19 PM] stacey#1000
And they get caught.

[12-Aug-21 02:41 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642

[12-Aug-21 02:42 PM] bonnie591#0591
If he does come back then ig appeal ofc

He's unlikely to come since he got up at 8am for his gcse results so he's probs tired


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] stacey#1000
I think hes doing schoolwork


[12-Aug-21 06:20 PM] stacey#1000

[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] acelesteq#9395

[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] bonnie591#0591
General certificate of secondary education


[12-Aug-21 06:21 PM] acelesteq#9395
O_o


[12-Aug-21 06:22 PM] bonnie591#0591
Gcse better cuz its assessed in year 11 instead of having to do an exam every year to move onto next grade


[12-Aug-21 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq whats the big test called in the U.S everyone has to do with like math and science and everything else on it


[12-Aug-21 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
I forget


[12-Aug-21 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
canada doesnt do exams like that


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
you do an exam for every single class on its own


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
then they test you on math EQAO


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
The fact that 16-18 year olds / high school has mandatory stuff yuck


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ooh


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
then they make you do a literacy test


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
to test your english skills


[12-Aug-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
then in colleges they make you do a literacy test again before even getting in


[12-Aug-21 06:24 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hm complicated


[12-Aug-21 06:24 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Aug-21 04:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
are they blacklisted or banned


[14-Aug-21 04:36 PM] ethan;#0003
Both


[14-Aug-21 04:36 PM] bonnie591#0591
um i cant find their blacklist


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
using their userid


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
They have chained their name


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
So many times


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah but im using userid so it would come up


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] bonnie591#0591
unless the card has no id


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
I don‚Äôt think it does


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
I think I made the card like a year ago


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003
When she was banned


[14-Aug-21 04:37 PM] ethan;#0003

[14-Aug-21 04:39 PM] bonnie591#0591

[14-Aug-21 07:45 PM] stacey#1000
Rip I couldn‚Äôt find them anyways to promote


[14-Aug-21 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
@lyss I‚Äôm not sure if blaire wants to be an MR again I spoke to her about it before


[14-Aug-21 07:46 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs a former manager and I‚Äôm not 100% sure she wishes to be an mr again


[14-Aug-21 07:47 PM] stacey#1000
I mean she is quite active so I would think she might want to...? Idk im just close friends with her and I remember speaking to her regarding it before


[14-Aug-21 07:51 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs also had a history of going inactive for months and not speaking to me at all. She‚Äôs done it twice and it worries me she will do it again. Just letting everyone here know. I‚Äôm a bit unsure of if she should be let back on MR team or if she even wants to.


[14-Aug-21 07:52 PM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 tagging your for your thoughts on it


[14-Aug-21 07:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Hmm


[14-Aug-21 07:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
Well they could get offered it in dms privately maybe instead of a promotion


[14-Aug-21 07:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
If they accept then yeah they get the rank


[14-Aug-21 07:53 PM] bonnie591#0591
But nothing is forced upon them then


[14-Aug-21 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
The thing is I worry about her activity. She was like Megan  and Alex and would leave for months because of school or something and come back and then leave again.


[14-Aug-21 07:54 PM] stacey#1000
So I just worry about that


[14-Aug-21 07:55 PM] bonnie591#0591
They'll just get demoted if they are really inactive. It's a head position so it's not the end of the world if they are inactive compared to manager and senior ranks


[14-Aug-21 07:55 PM] stacey#1000
She also just started school again and could just go inactive again for months like last time.


[14-Aug-21 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
Alright I do think she should be given a chance for sure just monitor her activity closely if she accepts it.


[14-Aug-21 07:56 PM] stacey#1000
I like the idea of asking her in DMs first because again I don‚Äôt know if she wants to be an MR again.


[14-Aug-21 09:00 PM] lyss#0709
okay, so you want me to just dm them and ask them whenever i do it? @bonnie591 @stacey


[14-Aug-21 09:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
Ya


[14-Aug-21 09:01 PM] lyss#0709
alright


[14-Aug-21 11:01 PM] acelesteq#9395
@Tattoblue personally I think it should‚Äôve never been done since they brought someone when there‚Äôs a whole gui system for that to make it fair for everyone in general. Maybe she thought it was okay and she probably wanted to interview a friend of hers


[14-Aug-21 11:02 PM] cory!#8287
i dont see anything wrong with picking ur interviewees


[14-Aug-21 11:02 PM] cory!#8287
she shouldnt have said later loser out loud tho


[14-Aug-21 11:02 PM] acelesteq#9395
Although I‚Äôm unsure if this is written warning wise, I personally think it should be a normal reminder/warning since there hasn‚Äôt been an announcement regarding it nor much input regarding using commands like that simply for a little minor thing like that


[14-Aug-21 11:04 PM] courtney#5125
i dont think she should receive any consequences for that... i think its fine to handpick an interviewee as long as youre still interviewing them fairly and using the correct procedures. also i think its obvious that theyre friends and saying "later loser" as a joke


[14-Aug-21 11:05 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah I agree I think Justin has beef with faith ngl but thought id share it with u guys anywayszs


[14-Aug-21 11:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
Why do people have sort of beef with someone


[14-Aug-21 11:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
üòî


[14-Aug-21 11:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah.. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with this. Don‚Äôt even know why it was reported.. Faith and Abby are friends and doubt Abby would have taken that the ‚Äúwrong way‚Äù


[14-Aug-21 11:28 PM] KjRBLX#2053
The bring interviewee button sometimes doesn‚Äôt even work anyway


[14-Aug-21 11:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
I don‚Äôt think consequences should be issued.


[14-Aug-21 11:29 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Petty report.


[14-Aug-21 11:29 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeh


[14-Aug-21 11:51 PM] stacey#1000
There is no rule that says you can‚Äôtuse the bring command to bring people at interviews....I have MRs do it all the time when there is extra interviewees. If an mr wants to bring someone it‚Äôs fine as long as everyone gets interviewed.....I see nothing wrong with this and it‚Äôs very minor.


[14-Aug-21 11:55 PM] stacey#1000

Just gonna start banning some people who have been really toxic today and yesterday and had multiple warning for stuff


[15-Aug-21 03:29 AM] bonnie591#0591
And those who are cyber bullying indirectly


[15-Aug-21 06:45 AM] bonnie591#0591
Gonna request for rule 5 to include toxicity so we have a bit more flexibility and reason to warn them since they way they are doing it is usually just not enough for a warning


[15-Aug-21 09:11 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Yes and it‚Äôs been like the same group of people


[15-Aug-21 11:07 AM] stacey#1000
https://trello.com/c/H6MjGLCc thoughts please since I had to cancel the other promotion


[15-Aug-21 01:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828
@acelesteq yeah tbh blacklist them, those are the same group of people that have been causing drama and getting warnings and mutes in general discussion as well


[15-Aug-21 01:04 PM] Tattoblue#5828

Just a general question, does Imag sometimes message you if you need a host and she's not even in the server?


[15-Aug-21 01:20 PM] stacey#1000
Needs one more vote! https://trello.com/c/H6MjGLCc


[15-Aug-21 01:21 PM] stacey#1000
And imag always asks me like last minute to host


[15-Aug-21 01:24 PM] acelesteq#9395
just wondering, she asked me if I needed a host and when I said s2 was open she got it claimed but wasn't even in the server


[15-Aug-21 01:25 PM] stacey#1000
She‚Äôs usually on a server for me when she asks


[15-Aug-21 01:25 PM] stacey#1000
But always asks late

I was sent those pictures from someone within the server, if anyone wants to ban them from the Bloxton Discord for their involvement with the server / impersonation of a High-Rank you can do so (if they're not already banned)


[15-Aug-21 02:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
already doing so!


[15-Aug-21 02:23 PM] acelesteq#9395
I just had to find their roblox username first

@bonnie591 as in for the discord ban system for appeal; are all these blacklisted members going to be perm or added time?


[15-Aug-21 02:56 PM] acelesteq#9395
she's the one who made the BH hate server


[15-Aug-21 02:57 PM] lyss#0709
yeah they're just requesting proof


[15-Aug-21 02:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
They are all community blacklisted so they can't appeal for 4 months anyway


[15-Aug-21 02:57 PM] acelesteq#9395
so want me to add them?


[15-Aug-21 02:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
I don't think it should be perm cuz perm should only be for serious serious stuff


[15-Aug-21 02:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
Nope


[15-Aug-21 02:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
No need to be added to channel since their community blacklist says when it was added to board


[15-Aug-21 02:58 PM] acelesteq#9395
I think you can since it doesn't show who's recording


[15-Aug-21 02:58 PM] lyss#0709

[15-Aug-21 03:03 PM] xM_inn#2821
I gather I won't have much time there before being banned though


[15-Aug-21 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
@lyss blaire is usually on later at night as well but has dinner around 8-9 est since they are in pst timezone


[15-Aug-21 03:03 PM] stacey#1000
@xM_inn oh nvm its all good


[15-Aug-21 03:04 PM] acelesteq#9395
personally I think there should be an announcement to clear up regarding situations outside of bloxton that get brought into bloxton and how it wont be allowed if spoken upon public/to start up drama. If not public announcement, maybe an announcement to the MRs or only management+ regarding uprising toxicity within general and to be more aware for any community members.


[15-Aug-21 03:05 PM] Tattoblue#5828
fricking nerd


[15-Aug-21 03:06 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yes agreed maybe only for management+ though


[15-Aug-21 03:06 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah since heads cant really be trusted with info like this


[15-Aug-21 03:07 PM] acelesteq#9395
if it's something that seems okay and alright to announce, I could do it


[15-Aug-21 03:08 PM] acelesteq#9395
i gotta eat dinner so ill be back soon


[15-Aug-21 03:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
I've requested baby to update rule 5 first to include toxicity


[15-Aug-21 03:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
So don't do an announcement yet


[15-Aug-21 03:08 PM] acelesteq#9395
ight


[15-Aug-21 03:08 PM] cory!#8287
This would be cocos 2nd blacklist since she was blacklisted before for cyberbullying


[15-Aug-21 03:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
I'll sort an unappealable thing for coco when I get home on Tuesday

[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Other get suspended for stealing reports right


[15-Aug-21 07:17 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Or we have changed the consequences?


[15-Aug-21 07:18 PM] KjRBLX#2053
Well umm seems she didn‚Äôt know tho


[15-Aug-21 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
No one knows about stealing reports until they get suspended. They learn not to do it from the suspension. She said she was ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and clearly somewhat knows it was wrong. She should get suspended and get the same consequences as anyone else. She shouldn‚Äôt get special treatment just because she‚Äôs an MR. 3 day suspension seems fair.


[15-Aug-21 07:20 PM] stacey#1000
That‚Äôs what everyone gets


[15-Aug-21 07:21 PM] acelesteq#9395
honestly that's so wrong

And not a great factor trait for someone who's an MR.


[15-Aug-21 07:22 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i agree with stacey


[15-Aug-21 07:24 PM] cory!#8287

he views trainees a different way than other managers


[15-Aug-21 07:32 PM] cory!#8287
cuz i asked kiki abt it and she said he looks at the lines and the leaderboard to view the trainees


[15-Aug-21 07:33 PM] cory!#8287
idk if thats allowed or not but


[15-Aug-21 07:34 PM] stacey#1000
I mean if he‚Äôs still doing it it‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll let Erick know.

@xM_inn The first message she said was edited which seems sus at first. Although she claims she didn't do anything, we don't know if she deleted messages nor why she would stay like you said.


[15-Aug-21 08:45 PM] acelesteq#9395
So I'm unsure about it, just sus


[15-Aug-21 08:47 PM] acelesteq#9395

[15-Aug-21 08:47 PM] acelesteq#9395
Shows her associating with two people who got blacklisted recently.


[15-Aug-21 08:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
yeah that's true


[15-Aug-21 08:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
the only problem is we don't really have any messages of her actually doing anything within the server at the moment


[15-Aug-21 08:50 PM] xM_inn#2821
someone could've changed her name/roles, but I still don't know why she stayed if she was aware of this


[15-Aug-21 08:50 PM] acelesteq#9395
Yeah someone else had to report it


[15-Aug-21 08:51 PM] acelesteq#9395
I guess we can give her a chance and reverse her CB since lack of proof

@bonnie591 in the reminder thing can you add a reminder of what is minor and major cuff abuse I had to correct a couple that said minor abuse but was clearly major when the person was cuffing innocent people for no reason


[16-Aug-21 11:27 AM] bonnie591#0591
Yuh sure!


[16-Aug-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
A couple other things I noticed yesterday while clearing the board as well:

-double checking usernames. 

-ban requests or fire requests for major spamming showing it 3 times is not major. More proof needed for it to be major if it‚Äôs only shown 3 times. Major is spamming 5+ times.


[16-Aug-21 11:29 AM] stacey#1000
Ok that‚Äôs all.

[16-Aug-21 06:28 PM] courtney#5125
well it looks like he was fired from mr because of the blacklisted alt, but it doesnt appear that he was ever blacklisted himself


[16-Aug-21 06:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
I'm unsure on what to vote


[16-Aug-21 06:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
They were an MR using an ALT, but then they also did other stuff like cyberbullying


[16-Aug-21 06:41 PM] acelesteq#9395
It's been over a year and the proof I saw within the alt seems very clear but if they didn't change, I don't think they would attempt to appeal


[16-Aug-21 06:42 PM] acelesteq#9395
Alongside that their appeal was very detained and I've haven't heard any past behavior that they could've still continued doing.


[16-Aug-21 06:43 PM] acelesteq#9395
I think I'm leading towards yes as it's been over a year and if accepted, they would be heavy moderated I'd believe


[16-Aug-21 06:56 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
sorry went to go eat


[16-Aug-21 06:57 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
hm yeah, idk I haven‚Äôt heard of this j6mes account since they were banned so if that means they had over a year tor reflect then I‚Äôm not against them coming back into the discord server again. apparently in their last appeal they were MRs at boba and Pastriez within last year

‚Äúmore valuable‚Äù


[17-Aug-21 11:29 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Are they trying to say they should be promoted quicker than non formers?


[17-Aug-21 11:30 AM] KjRBLX#2053
Or they should be listened to more


[17-Aug-21 12:32 PM] cory!#8287
I think they‚Äôre trying to say that the former mr role should overlap the lr role


[17-Aug-21 12:32 PM] cory!#8287
In the discord


[17-Aug-21 12:33 PM] cory!#8287
So like when u chat your name would be the green color instead of the blue one


[17-Aug-21 12:33 PM] cory!#8287
Idk


[17-Aug-21 12:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
either way thats dumb considering that they dont work for us anymore technically when having the former mr role first


[17-Aug-21 12:37 PM] acelesteq#9395
LR role over mr role = they work for us as an LR


[17-Aug-21 12:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
nah


[17-Aug-21 12:41 PM] KjRBLX#2053
cuz like..


[17-Aug-21 12:42 PM] KjRBLX#2053
if a former hr doesn't go over LR


[17-Aug-21 12:43 PM] KjRBLX#2053
honor role doesnt either


[17-Aug-21 12:44 PM] KjRBLX#2053
imagine they come with this petition with 1000 signs on it and we've already decided no without telling them ahead of time

like juice wrld said "all the girls are the same" expect replace that with "all formers are the same"

[18-Aug-21 12:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
@acelesteq happy to take chief?


[18-Aug-21 12:33 PM] bonnie591#0591
@anna @drizzle same as usual, send them a letter saying they are currently inactive and need to respond to the letter within 7 days explaining why. they then have to either submit an inactivity notice or become more active. if they do respond and don't go on notice, their activity will be reviewed every 2 weeks. failure to respond or be active without a notice is a demotion to lr. you may make your own letter or i can give you one that i made two months ago


[18-Aug-21 12:35 PM] drizzle#4256
ok!


[18-Aug-21 12:40 PM] anna#0004

[18-Aug-21 12:43 PM] bonnie591#0591
same as above, however you should mention that this is their final warning as this is the 2nd time this year they've been given a letter for inactivity. a demotion to lr will occur if they go inactive again without a notice after the letter is sent


[18-Aug-21 12:43 PM] acelesteq#9395
so i make my own inactive letter to them?


[18-Aug-21 12:44 PM] acelesteq#9395

[19-Aug-21 07:28 AM] acelesteq#9395
@bonnie591 I mean there‚Äôs not much evidence regarding them removing reactions nor hogging (I do believe we can check which cards they made etc) but they claim another manager said the same about her so idk maybe try to get another manager input that was said to claim the same thing as that management who reported her


[19-Aug-21 07:28 AM] acelesteq#9395
Or either we can take that evidence and possibly give a verbal or written idk


[19-Aug-21 09:29 AM] courtney#5125
^^


[19-Aug-21 09:31 AM] courtney#5125
i feel like thats sort of a difficult thing to prove esp with it only coming from one manager and one specific instance


[19-Aug-21 09:41 AM] stacey#1000
@bonnie591 if she didn‚Äôt archive the card and didn‚Äôt listen to me then things don‚Äôt look good for her

[19-Aug-21 09:42 AM] stacey#1000
I checked the timing of the cards. Libby added hers almost an hour after the first one so I DMed her about it


[19-Aug-21 09:42 AM] stacey#1000
There is literally no excuse to adding it almost an hour later...,


[19-Aug-21 09:44 AM] stacey#1000
It doesn‚Äôt matter who reacts to it first or what not it should be obvious not to make a whole new duplicated card right underneath another one that was made....


[19-Aug-21 09:44 AM] stacey#1000
She doesn‚Äôt need a warning cause I told her about it but it‚Äôs concerning if she didn‚Äôt listen to me and didn‚Äôt archive the card


[19-Aug-21 09:45 AM] courtney#5125
yeah she never archived it or added her evidence to the first card that was made


[19-Aug-21 09:45 AM] courtney#5125
this was the first one https://trello.com/c/KDsB32xX/42374-turty10000-6-major-cuff-abuse

[19-Aug-21 09:49 AM] stacey#1000
Krystal added it at 7:53 and she added it at 8:46.....so I don‚Äôt get how it happened for her to add a whole new card ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[19-Aug-21 10:06 AM] bonnie591#0591

I think a warning will be good since it‚Äôs not too major

no ive been really busy üò≠


[20-Aug-21 01:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
sure if everyone agrees with that, may you do the vote and issue the warning if you arent busy?

tbh it would be shocking if we had a senior as an alt

two managers as alt


[20-Aug-21 05:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
and one head as an alt


[20-Aug-21 05:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
like


[20-Aug-21 05:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
how


[20-Aug-21 06:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
my background checks usually consist of:

-checking badges (if inventory is open)
-checking join date
-checking current username and past usernames in trello, this discord and main discord
-searching their discord id and seeing if theres any other verified accounts they had in the past and also seeing when they joined discord
-checking their userid to see when they got a job here and how close it was to the join date
-checking what other games they play and if they work in other groups as well
-checking follower account and friends
-checking their first messages within the discord server to see if they instantly start reporting or are they a noob


[20-Aug-21 06:31 PM] bonnie591#0591
unfortunately sometimes people still get through though, i did inndetentions background check and everything was clear to me unless something was missed

I played the mimic with blaire on Thursday and then that‚Äôs when I was told they were gone away all weekend


[22-Aug-21 10:26 AM] bonnie591#0591
Ah alright


[22-Aug-21 10:28 AM] lyss#0709
alrightt!


[22-Aug-21 10:59 AM] stacey#1000
The leaker is someone I promoted to head before the channel names were changed I think


[22-Aug-21 10:59 AM] stacey#1000
It looks like my guide before I updated it.


[22-Aug-21 11:00 AM] stacey#1000
Or it could be a former mr that resigned and is doing it as well.


[22-Aug-21 11:05 AM] stacey#1000
And before the account age checks were added because that was added as well but haven‚Äôt seen that part of my guide leaked.

[22-Aug-21 02:49 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-Aug-21 03:10 PM] stacey#1000

@bonnie591 from the proof u posted in ongoing investigations are they taking about the dais_ies wyatt or a diff one


[22-Aug-21 03:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
they are talking about eddie being wyatt or something


[22-Aug-21 03:54 PM] cory!#8287
interesting


[22-Aug-21 03:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
they claim to be the staff lounge leaker from a few months ago


[22-Aug-21 03:54 PM] bonnie591#0591
they said they had hr info too but dont wanna share it


[22-Aug-21 03:54 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-Aug-21 03:54 PM] cory!#8287

[22-Aug-21 03:55 PM] bonnie591#0591

[22-Aug-21 03:55 PM] cory!#8287
hmm


[22-Aug-21 03:55 PM] cory!#8287
LOL they def don‚Äôt have any hr info


[22-Aug-21 03:55 PM] cory!#8287
maybe just the channel names in the main discord but


[22-Aug-21 03:56 PM] bonnie591#0591
yeah like #senior-rules and #hr-logs!!!


[22-Aug-21 03:57 PM] cory!#8287
In that discord server they think that posting those channel names are leaking and I‚Äôm like


[22-Aug-21 03:57 PM] bonnie591#0591
LOL


[22-Aug-21 03:57 PM] cory!#8287
like most of that info is just assumptions ngl


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] cory!#8287
like for the sessions is like basic knowledge most people would know


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
imagine if they guess #v7-things-we-must-have


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] cory!#8287
but the discord section has some leaking


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] cory!#8287
LOL


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
they can probs work out #attendance-logs


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] bonnie591#0591
since they seen the command


[22-Aug-21 03:58 PM] cory!#8287
yeah prob


[22-Aug-21 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
#hr-announcements is another thing


[22-Aug-21 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
#rank-logs maybe


[22-Aug-21 03:59 PM] cory!#8287
but they think it goes to the information board at the hotel


[22-Aug-21 03:59 PM] bonnie591#0591
oop


[22-Aug-21 03:59 PM] cory!#8287
someone thought that hrs check lr activity on that board at the hotel and at sessions


[22-Aug-21 04:00 PM] cory!#8287
It was pretty interesting


[22-Aug-21 04:00 PM] cory!#8287

[22-Aug-21 04:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
i remember when an mr dmed me to check if someone saying "bonnie has access to active lrs" was leaking


[22-Aug-21 04:01 PM] bonnie591#0591
like I WISH I HAD THAT..


[22-Aug-21 04:01 PM] cory!#8287

[22-Aug-21 04:02 PM] stacey#1000
Someone leaked the attendance info


[22-Aug-21 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
If you want to narrow down who it is. Look at everyone I‚Äôve promoted before the account age checks went into place and before I updated my guide


[22-Aug-21 04:03 PM] bonnie591#0591
its when people accidentally say it and also when lrs have chatlogs via exploits


[22-Aug-21 04:03 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs my guide before it was updated but could also be a former mr I promoted in the past


[22-Aug-21 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
When were account age checks added


[22-Aug-21 04:04 PM] stacey#1000
Cause it‚Äôs my old guide they have nothing about acc age checks in it.


[22-Aug-21 04:04 PM] cory!#8287
like


[22-Aug-21 04:04 PM] cory!#8287
March?


[22-Aug-21 04:04 PM] cory!#8287
I think


[22-Aug-21 04:04 PM] cory!#8287
Let me double check


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] cory!#8287
ya March 2nd


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
So it was someone I promoted before that.


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] cory!#8287
mhm


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] cory!#8287
I think they‚Äôre a former but you never know


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
And someone that is probably still a head if they have no management info but they are also not leaking anything inside the channels


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] cory!#8287
yeah


[22-Aug-21 04:05 PM] stacey#1000
So yeah it could be a former


[22-Aug-21 04:06 PM] cory!#8287
they said something about it being a head of services


[22-Aug-21 04:06 PM] cory!#8287
but they might be lying


[22-Aug-21 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
They could be lying yeah


[22-Aug-21 04:06 PM] stacey#1000
Let me look at who I‚Äôve promoted


[22-Aug-21 04:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
they were begging me to give them the hr doc at the hotel


[22-Aug-21 04:08 PM] KjRBLX#2053
It goest to a Trello and the assistance board thingy at the hotel and it list the most active LRS


[22-Aug-21 04:08 PM] bonnie591#0591
they think leaking the head doc is so powerful but in reality they arent leaking anything super confidential


[22-Aug-21 04:08 PM] cory!#8287
it also might be someone another hr promoted since u mentioned u gave ur promo guides to other hrs


[22-Aug-21 04:08 PM] stacey#1000
It‚Äôs one of these people

most likely not to be little since shes a manager


[22-Aug-21 04:09 PM] stacey#1000
If it‚Äôs the same person as before they could still be bst time


[22-Aug-21 04:09 PM] cory!#8287
Desing is CST


[22-Aug-21 04:10 PM] cory!#8287
I think aysevin was BST


[22-Aug-21 04:10 PM] stacey#1000

And they are still a head


[22-Aug-21 04:11 PM] cory!#8287
yes that is what I was thinking


[22-Aug-21 04:11 PM] cory!#8287
I never really notice them online during late hours for CST


[22-Aug-21 04:11 PM] cory!#8287
like 7 pm etc


[22-Aug-21 04:11 PM] stacey#1000
Let me look at what I sent them


[22-Aug-21 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
Yep same guide


[22-Aug-21 04:12 PM] stacey#1000
Same one that‚Äôs being leaked not updated


[22-Aug-21 04:16 PM] cory!#8287
should we question them about it


[22-Aug-21 04:20 PM] stacey#1000
If anyone wishes to suspend them and question them I think we have enough to suspend them for


[22-Aug-21 04:23 PM] cory!#8287
if no one else wants to I can do it when I get home


[22-Aug-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Wait


[22-Aug-21 04:26 PM] stacey#1000
Wait

Let me get a list of every single person I‚Äôve promoted to rank 8


[22-Aug-21 04:35 PM] cory!#8287
we‚Äôve had suspicions of ry in the past being an alt


[22-Aug-21 04:38 PM] stacey#1000
One thing I find weird about rhy but the thing is as well the acc age checks was included in the guide I used to send her and that is not included in the leaks

[22-Aug-21 04:41 PM] cory!#8287

[22-Aug-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
So it was a former MR


[22-Aug-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
Looks the exact same to me


[22-Aug-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000
Nothing inside the channels being leaked


[22-Aug-21 04:42 PM] stacey#1000

[22-Aug-21 04:44 PM] cory!#8287

they were head of security i think cuz i fired them for leaking


[22-Aug-21 07:38 PM] cory!#8287
idk who promoted them tho


[22-Aug-21 07:38 PM] stacey#1000
Idk either


[22-Aug-21 07:39 PM] stacey#1000
But I‚Äôm going to monitor what they do cause then it‚Äôs bye bye former role and banned for them soon


[22-Aug-21 07:39 PM] cory!#8287
emily promoted them


[22-Aug-21 07:40 PM] cory!#8287
@emily have u used staceys guide to promote galaxy before


[22-Aug-21 07:40 PM] cory!#8287
cuz it might be them


[22-Aug-21 07:40 PM] stacey#1000
They leaked more then just my guide


[22-Aug-21 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
They mentioned Emily‚Äôs as well in the chat


[22-Aug-21 07:41 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i saw that


[22-Aug-21 07:41 PM] stacey#1000
But I still think it‚Äôs a former cause nothing inside the mr channels so far has not been leaked recently and it‚Äôs outdated guides


[22-Aug-21 07:42 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i read the channels with the leaking and it looks old


[22-Aug-21 07:42 PM] stacey#1000
And like I mentioned before nothing about acc age was included on mine that I updated months ago


[22-Aug-21 07:43 PM] emily#4444
i‚Äôm pretty sure it was one i made


[22-Aug-21 07:43 PM] emily#4444
i meant to reply to this oops


[22-Aug-21 07:44 PM] cory!#8287

well he still has all the office keys and stuff and award winner role, staff member etc i dont think taking away 1 former role will do much....fire and ban from the discord...idk? he is just a mod that hasnt really said too much in the server about it


[24-Aug-21 06:05 PM] ethan;#0003
if they are in the leak server they should be blacklisted from becoming an MR until they leave

oh wow


[24-Aug-21 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
at least we know its a head and not a manager


[24-Aug-21 06:22 PM] stacey#1000
and still someone I promoted I think


[24-Aug-21 06:23 PM] stacey#1000
idk


[24-Aug-21 06:25 PM] stacey#1000
i think its the same leaker that was here before


[24-Aug-21 06:26 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
well you never know, could be a manager trying to make us think it's a head by leaking that but who knows. annoying tbh


[24-Aug-21 06:26 PM] stacey#1000
true


[24-Aug-21 06:27 PM] acelesteq#9395
if it was a manager


[24-Aug-21 06:27 PM] acelesteq#9395
honestly just why


[24-Aug-21 06:27 PM] acelesteq#9395
like why


[24-Aug-21 06:28 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe its @acelesteq trying to make us think it's a head :Thonk:


[24-Aug-21 06:29 PM] bonnie591#0591
also the fact the person getting promoted is the one screen sharing in vc AHAH @acelesteq


[24-Aug-21 06:34 PM] acelesteq#9395
IKR


[24-Aug-21 06:34 PM] acelesteq#9395

[24-Aug-21 08:21 PM] stacey#1000
@Polk Promoted Lezlieh to head receptionist | August, 24, 2021.


[25-Aug-21 08:01 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@stacey good idea


[25-Aug-21 08:01 AM] Tattoblue#5828
Tbhh


[25-Aug-21 08:01 AM] stacey#1000
People wouldn‚Äôt be able to lie about it either. It‚Äôs perfect


[25-Aug-21 08:02 AM] anna#0004
smart


[25-Aug-21 08:24 AM] stacey#1000
I also think we should change something on each section to be safe because we don‚Äôt know if they would spam the whole guide or not. So like change something in the hotel section, then the training/interview section, then the discord server section. So 3 different key things


[25-Aug-21 10:53 AM] Tattoblue#5828
@Polk Smh.

[25-Aug-21 11:38 AM] acelesteq#9395
It‚Äôs so childish for someone to leak


[25-Aug-21 11:38 AM] acelesteq#9395
But I find it smart to do that

luke did something


[25-Aug-21 06:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
to make her mad


[25-Aug-21 06:46 PM] Tattoblue#5828
clearly


[25-Aug-21 06:47 PM] bonnie591#0591
if he didnt leak it to anyone then well its a case of internet safety, if u dm ur friend TOO MUCH INFORMATION then thats not our fault when they find ur school. pretty sure strxw or whatever found treys school and never got punished for it


[25-Aug-21 06:48 PM] bonnie591#0591
maybe we could hold him back from senior in the future but i dont think anything should be done especially when this is just revenge and outdated evidence mostly


[25-Aug-21 06:49 PM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah its concerning but


[25-Aug-21 06:49 PM] Tattoblue#5828

[25-Aug-21 06:57 PM] acelesteq#9395
but sometimes when you got a friend and you hear they are going thru something


[25-Aug-21 06:57 PM] acelesteq#9395
you dont know if its for attention or they need serious help/need someone to talk to


[26-Aug-21 07:17 AM] acelesteq#9395
Aidvan is the one who leaked before, correct?


[26-Aug-21 07:17 AM] acelesteq#9395
Or still is one


[26-Aug-21 07:34 AM] Tattoblue#5828

@xM_inn bod approval to suspend the 2 MRs I announced


[27-Aug-21 09:49 AM] stacey#1000
?*


[27-Aug-21 09:49 AM] xM_inn#2821
yep go for it


[27-Aug-21 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
oh you're right, I didn't even notice that at first


[27-Aug-21 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
must've been because of the different PFPs in the appeal screenshot and those screenshots


[27-Aug-21 09:50 AM] Tattoblue#5828
yeah


[27-Aug-21 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
in that case, he'll be re-banned


[27-Aug-21 09:50 AM] Tattoblue#5828
kk


[27-Aug-21 09:50 AM] xM_inn#2821
thanks for letting me know!


[27-Aug-21 09:52 AM] stacey#1000
I‚Äôll work on suspending them later. Does anyone want to suspend 1 person and I‚Äôll suspend the other one


[27-Aug-21 09:52 AM] stacey#1000
So it‚Äôs easier then trying to do 2 at once


[27-Aug-21 09:53 AM] Tattoblue#5828
i can suspend


[27-Aug-21 09:53 AM] Tattoblue#5828
1


[27-Aug-21 09:53 AM] Tattoblue#5828
who


[27-Aug-21 09:53 AM] stacey#1000
Whichever person you want


[27-Aug-21 09:53 AM] Tattoblue#5828
actually i can do both if u want stacey


[27-Aug-21 09:53 AM] Tattoblue#5828
im not doing anything rn


[27-Aug-21 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
If you want to sure cause I won‚Äôt be able to suspend one till the evening I‚Äôm not home rn


[27-Aug-21 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
Their suspension reasoning would be acting unprofessional and being disrespectful to others in MR channels.


[27-Aug-21 09:54 AM] stacey#1000
And then I would do 3 days


[27-Aug-21 09:54 AM] Tattoblue#5828
ok


[27-Aug-21 09:54 AM] stacey#1000

[27-Aug-21 06:37 PM] stacey#1000
@Bloo_Berriez rip your gamenight, thats why i dont talk in mr channels or host mr gamenights anymore cause there is always a leaker and its honestly not worth it . Its also why I wont trust heads ever sadly cause this has been an issue forever. one leaker gets fired there is another one the next day and its always a head


[27-Aug-21 06:38 PM] stacey#1000
or most cases a head


[27-Aug-21 06:38 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah unfortunately :/ I told JJ to reset the link that way no one else could join.

[27-Aug-21 07:36 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Ya that‚Äôs why I think we should investigate inndetention üòü


[27-Aug-21 07:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah


[27-Aug-21 07:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
cause clearly if the james person brought up their name


[27-Aug-21 07:38 PM] acelesteq#9395
the day they got promoted, that's major red flags


[27-Aug-21 07:40 PM] xM_inn#2821
not at the moment, the MR is still in the GC though so when there's anymore information they'll let me know


[27-Aug-21 07:44 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was him leaking


[27-Aug-21 07:45 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah but we also can't factor that it couldn't possibly be a management or senior too leaking


[27-Aug-21 07:46 PM] acelesteq#9395
Ofc if it was a senior, they would leak senior announcement stuff which hasnt happen


[27-Aug-21 07:46 PM] acelesteq#9395
and if it was management+ then they wouldve leaked management-announcements


[27-Aug-21 07:46 PM] acelesteq#9395
but they didnt


[27-Aug-21 07:46 PM] acelesteq#9395
so leaking mr-announcement is the more "safer" side for them since they arent exposing themselves


[27-Aug-21 07:51 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah thats the way I also look at it.


[27-Aug-21 07:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
yeah its sad honestly


[27-Aug-21 07:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
but I took a few minutes to look into inndetention account and they joined last year then looked at friends list


[27-Aug-21 07:53 PM] acelesteq#9395
which wasnt sus


[27-Aug-21 07:54 PM] acelesteq#9395
idk the only red alert i got from them is 1; account age 2; randomly dming


[27-Aug-21 08:51 PM] cory!#8287
i looked more into it and its super possible it is them


[27-Aug-21 08:51 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Wym by that


[27-Aug-21 08:52 PM] cory!#8287
j6mescharles last session was may 10th and inndetention first got interviewed on may 13th so its possible


[27-Aug-21 08:52 PM] Tattoblue#5828
Oo?


[27-Aug-21 08:56 PM] cory!#8287
also reported right away when they joined the discord


[27-Aug-21 08:56 PM] cory!#8287
another red flag


[27-Aug-21 09:10 PM] cory!#8287
seniors should just host (unless theres no managers) and managers should name, not sure why those 2 are taking management responsibilities


[27-Aug-21 09:10 PM] cory!#8287
i dont see a problem with seniors supervising tho


[27-Aug-21 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
i think we should make an announcement to all seniors


[27-Aug-21 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
just a reminder and if it continued then warn them


[27-Aug-21 09:13 PM] stacey#1000
cause they shouldnt be naming while hosting if managers are there


[27-Aug-21 09:14 PM] cory!#8287
agreed


[27-Aug-21 09:14 PM] cory!#8287
i think its because theres 1 manager and a lot of trainees so they just assume they need help


[27-Aug-21 09:14 PM] cory!#8287
even tho 90% of the managers enjoy solo naming


[27-Aug-21 09:14 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
unless the manager asks for help, seniors should focus on getting through rules


[27-Aug-21 09:15 PM] stacey#1000
unless there is like 20 trainees adnd they ask for help


[27-Aug-21 09:15 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
probably not the best idea to be doing both at same time as you could make mistakes when naming staff to help (naming too many etc)


[27-Aug-21 09:16 PM] stacey#1000
ok so an announcement is probs best


[27-Aug-21 09:16 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
yeah that sounds good

i think he mentioned that he has pings on for that channel üíÄ


[27-Aug-21 09:29 PM] stacey#1000
he should be given a warning cause its a rule

[27-Aug-21 09:31 PM] cory!#8287
yeah i think a written warning would be suitable since its an official rule now in the rule channel so


[27-Aug-21 09:31 PM] stacey#1000
alright ill prepare an announcement for seniors now


[27-Aug-21 09:36 PM] acelesteq#9395
yes i agree with announcement


[27-Aug-21 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
I made a nice long announcement for seniors that probably scared them\


[27-Aug-21 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
now i need to sleep cause i got called in to work on my day off its so fun


[27-Aug-21 09:50 PM] stacey#1000
oh i forgot would anyone like to warn jack


[27-Aug-21 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
@acelesteq @Bloo_Berriez @cory! @ethan; pinging since u are online and I have to get off ^^


[27-Aug-21 09:51 PM] stacey#1000
i spent a lot longer on that announcement then I thought 0-0


[27-Aug-21 09:52 PM] ethan;#0003
is the hogging questions one of those unwritten rules that was only ever announced in an announcement once


[27-Aug-21 09:52 PM] stacey#1000
it is in the new management rules and it was announced to them they should read/abide by the rules

its not an unwritten rule so he violated a rule

which is why he has to be warned


[27-Aug-21 09:53 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Yeah no problem

dang looks so much like discord


[28-Aug-21 06:07 PM] bonnie591#0591
very confusing


[28-Aug-21 06:08 PM] acelesteq#9395
guilded supposedly sold their layout to discord


[28-Aug-21 06:08 PM] acelesteq#9395
which is why they look similar


[28-Aug-21 06:10 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
Kinda reminds me of Skype like the font


[28-Aug-21 06:11 PM] ethan;#0003
guilded came before discord


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] Polk#1596
wait


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] Polk#1596
how do i get a custom id


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] acelesteq#9395
you go to settings


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] acelesteq#9395
and it says "custom URL"


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] acelesteq#9395
first one


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] acelesteq#9395
then you type in


[28-Aug-21 06:13 PM] acelesteq#9395
"polkinolk"


[28-Aug-21 06:14 PM] acelesteq#9395

Ummmm


[29-Aug-21 01:24 PM] cory!#8287
I don‚Äôt think they would have gotten promoted anyway cuz they made their acc in like May this year


[29-Aug-21 01:24 PM] cory!#8287
but ya they should get rank locked


[29-Aug-21 01:46 PM] bonnie591#0591
Yeah rank lock them


[29-Aug-21 01:47 PM] acelesteq#9395
do a vote?


[29-Aug-21 02:05 PM] bonnie591#0591
Nah just feel free to add them, put one year for duration


[29-Aug-21 02:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
ight


[29-Aug-21 02:05 PM] acelesteq#9395
ty


[30-Aug-21 09:01 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
uhm! I personally haven‚Äôt noticed it too much other than the few times of it being noted here that an MR accidentally kicked all at the hotel or something.


[30-Aug-21 09:02 PM] courtney#5125
yeah its sort of inevitable to happen to new mrs once in a while. as long as its not constantly happening to several mrs (those who ARENT new), its not really an issue


[30-Aug-21 09:02 PM] courtney#5125
sometimes it just happens tho


[30-Aug-21 09:09 PM] Bloo_Berriez#7642
^ Yeah. although a reminder announcement doesn‚Äôt hurt, that way everyone is on same page regarding kicking and having to include 4 letters of the users username. but other than that, hasn‚Äôt really been a major major issue that I‚Äôve noticed.


[30-Aug-21 09:27 PM] cory!#8287
I‚Äôve only noticed it with new MRs as well


[30-Aug-21 10:02 PM] acelesteq#9395
reminder announcement now or until later on when we get more MRs?


[30-Aug-21 10:02 PM] acelesteq#9395
cause this is the second time ive heard about it this month or so but i dont think a reminder is needed unless we get more reports within it


[30-Aug-21 10:03 PM] acelesteq#9395
sometimes its just mistakes but so far, people havent been as careful.


[30-Aug-21 10:20 PM] Beartikal#9760
You guys should modify Bloxton's Threads permissions. On 9/9 they become auto-enabled and then its enabled everywhere. set up the permissions for it (works well in help channels for-per-question basis) so that it doesn't become a mess on that date


[30-Aug-21 11:41 PM] ethan;#0003
i dont rlly see a point for them for the bloxton server


[31-Aug-21 04:04 AM] Polk#1596
are we not able to turn them off again


[31-Aug-21 04:04 AM] Polk#1596
i dont really see the point either


[31-Aug-21 04:12 AM] bonnie591#0591
Theres probably an option to have it only for hrs or something, I'll get it sorted


[31-Aug-21 11:39 AM] acelesteq#9395
@emily I can‚Äôt check Trello/discord bans rn since I‚Äôm at school but how long ago was she banned and what for?


[31-Aug-21 11:40 AM] emily#4444
not sure when she was banned since there's no date but she's banned for: Harassing mrs, tormenting and trying to provoke people


[31-Aug-21 11:41 AM] Tattoblue#5828
She‚Äôs gotten banned multiple times I believe as well


[31-Aug-21 11:41 AM] emily#4444
ya


[31-Aug-21 11:42 AM] acelesteq#9395
Oh I see


[31-Aug-21 12:04 PM] stacey#1000
Kenzi is just not a person I trust due to all the stuff she‚Äôs done in the past and she‚Äôs been appealed before and ruined it. So yeah no thanks.


[31-Aug-21 12:07 PM] stacey#1000
But if she‚Äôs not like on the unappealable list either so


[31-Aug-21 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
im pretty sure i banned her


[31-Aug-21 12:20 PM] ethan;#0003
i think it was around the time of the kylie situation


[31-Aug-21 12:35 PM] emily#4444
oh okay


[31-Aug-21 12:36 PM] emily#4444
yeah i agree, would be hard to trust her enough to appeal again


[31-Aug-21 04:33 PM] ethan;#0003
@acelesteq imag messaged me 1 minute after the start time of your session asking if there is a sub LOL
